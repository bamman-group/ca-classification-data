He was fortunate that, thanks to his own care over the preparations, he had a particularly strong artillery train. No less than eleven siege-guns and twelve field-pieces had been granted by the council of state on 12 July, and placed under his commander of artillery, captain edward tomlins. Yet for all this advantage, and his own numerical superiority, Cromwell hoped to take Drogheda by masterful but pacific methods. He was encouraged in this view by the fact that there were some desertions to his own army from that of the Irish leader Lord Inchiquin. To this end, he kept his own soldiers under extremely tight discipline, and two men who were caught plundering hens from some irish women on the road were hanged. In the meantime the country people, being well paid, were content to flock to the parliamentary army and sell it food, as had been anticipated by the dublin declaration. On 10 September cromwell issued his first official summons to sir arthur ashton to surrender the town, under a white flag, having in his own words \u201cbrought the army belonging to the parliament of england before this place to reduce it to obedience, to the end effusion of blood may be prevented.

It is the method by which individuals arrange themselves\u2014horses in a herd, wolves in a pack, people in a community\u2014so that they can live together. The game pits two opposing forces against each other, both equally important to survival: individual autonomy and community welfare. The object is to achieve dynamic equilibrium.  At times and under certain conditions individuals can be nearly autonomous. An individual can live alone and have no worry about rank, but no species can survive without interaction between individuals. The ultimate price would be more final than death. It would be extinction. On the other hand, complete individual subordination to the group is just as devastating. Life is neither static nor unchanging. With no individuality, there can be no change, no adaptation and, in an inherently changing world, any species unable to adapt is also doomed.  Humans in a community, whether it is as small as two people or as large as the world, and no matter what form the society takes, will arrange themselves according to some hierarchy. Commonly understood courtesies and customs can help to smooth the friction and ease the stress of maintaining a workable balance within this constantly changing system. In some situations most individuals will not have to compromise much of their personal independence for the welfare of the community. In others, the needs of the community may demand the utmost personal sacrifice of the individual, even to life itself. Neither is more right than the other, it depends on the circumstances; but neither extreme can be maintained for long, nor can a society last if a few people exercise their individuality at the expense of the community.", "label": 12.06703891476576, "group": "The Mammoth Hunters"}

My sister Lucy may possibly be better acquainted with her  sentiments than I am, as she was very intimate with her even before her marriage. She did not continue in that state above four months; and tho' I had reason to believe she was an unhappy wife, she lamented her husband's untimely death with such an extravagance of sorrow, as placed her very nearly on a footing with the Malabarian widows; for her health was so much impaired by her grief, that it was thought impossible she cou'd recover; nor have I ever seen her chearful since her husband died. But from the moment she perceived your particular attachment, her melancholy was encreased, and she has seemed twenty times upon the point of expressing her uneasiness at your constant assiduities. For these last three days she appeared to be quite retired within herself, and I have had so many disagreeable things to engross my  thoughts, that I was rather pleased at her reserve, and did not attempt to draw her out of it.", "label": -4.784152841516532, "group": "THE STORY OF LADY JULIANA HARLEY."}

My father was an Englishman, of a proud old stock, who came from the county of Kent, England, to this country, many years before my birth. His father sent him to college, when quite young, to acquire a thorough classical education. He was destined for the bar; but, happening to meet with a pretty young lady soon after his entrance, he became unfortunately enamoured of her.

In his parting interview with Lincoln, he was urged to remain to dinner the next day and meet a brilliant party whom the lady of the White House had invited to do him special honor. The General answered, apologetically: \"Mrs. Lincoln must excuse me. I must be in Tennessee at a given time.\" \"But we can't excuse you,\" said the President. \"Mrs. Lincoln's dinner without you would be Hamlet with Hamlet left out.\" \"I appreciate the honor Mrs. Lincoln would do me,\" said the General, \"but time is very important now. I ought to be at the front, and a dinner to me means a million dollars a day lost to the country.\" Lincoln was pleased with this answer, and said cheerfully, \"Well, we'll have the dinner without you.\"  After Lincoln's first meeting with General Grant he was asked regarding his personal impressions of the new commander. He replied, \"Well, I hardly know what to think of him. He's the quietest little fellow you ever saw. He makes the least fuss of any man I ever knew. I believe on several occasions he has been in this room a minute or so before I knew he was here. It's about so all around.

Always the first in the pursuit, it was several minutes before he was overtaken by his companions, who, when they lifted him up, immediately perceived his leg was broken. One of  his attendants then set off full speed for the village, and immediately returned with a sort of litter, on which he was borne to Warrington Castle; and as a surgeon from the next town had been sent for at the same time, he arrived almost as soon as the Baronet; and having set his leg, and declared the fracture by no means a dangerous one, he took leave, desiring his patient might be kept as quiet as possible. The character of our hero might more properly be termed a mixture of good qualities and foibles, than of virtues and vices: as he had more of the latter in his composition; and the  former, from the peculiarities of his education, though numerous, were inactive.

She laughed, showing her perfect white teeth. \u2018You speak very well French.\u2019 \u2018Je vous ai aime\u0301e la premie\u0300re fois que je vois ai vue ,\u2019 I continued emotionally. She laughed again and corrected my French, explaining that I should use the familiar \u2018tu\u2019. She thought about it and laughed again. She looked at her watch, but it had stopped; she indicated she wanted to know the time, explaining that at twelve o\u2019clock she had a very important appointment. \u2018Not this evening.\u2019 I said coyly. \u2018Oui, ce soir.\u2019 \u2018But you\u2019re fully engaged this evening, toute la nuit\u2019! She suddenly looked startled. \u2018Oh, non, non, non! Pas toute la nuit!\u2019 Then it became sordid. \u2018 Vingt francs pour le moment?\u2019 \u2018C\u2019est c\u0327a!\u2019 she replied emphatically.", "label": -4.855928904335275, "group": "My autobiography"}

Have you a good tavern in these parts?\u201d  Lisbeth stared at him, temporarily speechless, while he continued to smile down at her, his hands resting easily on the saddle before him. His suit was black velvet with a short doublet and wide knee-length breeches, finished with golden braid. He had dark hair and green-grey eyes and a narrow black mustache lined his upper lip. His good looks were spectacular\u2014but they were not the most important thing about him. For his face had an uncompromising ruthlessness and strength which marked him, in spite of his obvious aristocracy, as an adventurer and gambler, a man free from bonds and ties.  Lisbeth swallowed and made a little curtsy. \u201cYe mun like the Three Cups in Heathstone, m\u2019lord.\u201d She was afraid to recommend her own poor little village to these splendid strangers.  \u201cWhere\u2019s Heathstone from here?\u201d  \u201cHeathstone be damned!\u201d protested one of the men. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your own ordinary?

There! Out it boomed. First a warning, musical; then the hour, irrevocable. The leaden circles dissolved in the air. Such fools we are, she thought, crossing Victoria Street. For Heaven only knows why one loves it so, how one sees it so, making it up, building it round one, tumbling it, creating it every moment afresh; but the veriest frumps, the most dejected of miseries sitting on doorsteps (drink their downfall) do the same; can\u2019t be dealt with, she felt positive, by Acts of Parliament for that very reason: they love life. In people\u2019s eyes, in the swing, tramp, and trudge; in the bellow and the uproar; the carriages, motor cars, omnibuses, vans, sandwich men shuffling and swinging; brass bands; barrel organs; in the triumph and the jingle and the strange high singing of some aeroplane overhead was what she loved; life; London; this moment of June.", "label": -6.689999349200306, "group": "Mrs Dalloway"}

Lady Eleanor had retired ; fatigued, it was supposed, by having danced a good deal.  The couch on which, by the exertions of Frederick, Miss Montrevor, with Julia and Miss Huntley, were seated, was soon surrounded by the gentlemen who had most distinguished them during the evening ; among whom was Mr. Fair bank, a young man of a noble family and large fortune, whose person was too remarkable to pass unnoticed.
