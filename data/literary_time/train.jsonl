He was much over-dressed, in a gaudy vest of many colors, a blue neckerchief, bedropped gayly with yellow spots, and arranged with a flaunting tie, quite in keeping with the general air of the man. His hands, large and coarse, were plentifully bedecked with rings; and he wore a heavy gold watch-chain, with a bundle of seals of portentous size, and a great variety of colors, attached to it,--which, in the ardor of conversation, he was in the habit of flourishing and jingling with evident satisfaction.

In preaching a hejira to the country, I do not forget the interests of the children. Let no one dread country life for the young until they come to the full pith and stature of maturity; for their chances of doing things worth doing in the world are four to one against those of children who are city-bred. Four-fifths of the men and women who do great things are country-bred. This is out of all proportion to the birth-rate as between country and city, and one is at a loss to account for the disproportion, unless it is to be credited to environment. Is it due to pure air and sunshine, making redder blood and more vigorous development, to broader horizons and freedom from abnormal conventions? Or does a close relation to primary things give a newness to mind and body which is granted only to those who apply in person?  Whatever the reason, it certainly pays to be country-bred. The cities draw to themselves the cream of these youngsters, which is only natural; but the cities do not breed them, except as exotics.  If the unborn would heed my advice, I would say, By all means be born in the country,--in Ohio if possible.

Angel and Goddess are phrases you have been used to from him; and tho' spoken in  his humorous way, yet I am sure he most sincerely admires you. Mr. Fenwick, in a less determined manner, declares, that he will follow you to town, if you stay there above one fortnight.

The stern authority of his look startled her. \"Read this letter,\" said he, stretching forth his hand which held a letter, \"and tell me what that mortal deserves, who dares insult our holy order, and set our sacred prerogative at defiance.\" Madame distinguished the hand writing of the marquis, and the words of the Superior threw her into the utmost astonishment. She took the  letter. It was dictated by that spirit of proud vindictive rage, which so strongly marked the character of the marquis. Having discovered the retreat of Julia, and believing the monastery afforded her a willing sanctuary from his pursuit, he accused the Abate of encouraging his child in open rebellion to his will. He loaded him and his sacred order with opprobrium, and threatened, if she was not immediately resigned to the emissaries in waiting, he would in person lead on a force which should compel the church to yield to the superior authority of the father. The spirit of the Abate was roused by this menace; and Julia obtained from his pride, that protection which neither his principle nor his humanity would have granted. \"The man shall tremble,\" cried he,\"who dares defy our power, or question our sacred authority. The lady Julia is safe. I will protect her from this proud invader of our  rights, and teach him at least to venerate the power he cannot conquer.

Above them, her thick black brows slanted upward, cutting a startling oblique line in her magnolia-white skin\u2014that skin so prized by Southern women and so carefully guarded with bonnets, veils and mittens against hot Georgia suns.  Seated with Stuart and Brent Tarleton in the cool shade of the porch of Tara, her father\u2019s plantation, that bright April afternoon of 1861, she made a pretty picture. Her new green flowered-muslin dress spread its twelve yards of billowing material over her hoops and exactly matched the flat-heeled green morocco slippers her father had recently brought her from Atlanta. The dress set off to perfection the seventeen-inch waist, the smallest in three counties, and the tightly fitting basque showed breasts well matured for her sixteen years. But for all the modesty of her spreading skirts, the demureness of hair netted smoothly into a chignon and the quietness of small white hands folded in her lap, her true self was poorly concealed. The green eyes in the carefully sweet face were turbulent, willful, lusty with life, distinctly at variance with her decorous demeanor.

That Lucy was disposed to be jealous of her appeared very probable: it was plain that Edward had always spoken highly in her praise, not merely from Lucy's assertion, but from her venturing to trust her on so short a personal acquaintance, with a secret so confessedly and evidently important.

He himself often resembled Lady Bolingbroke's Lively description of Pope; that 'he was un politique aux choux et aux raves.'

On this point the President said:  In my present position, I could scarcely be justified were I to omit raising a warning voice against this approach of returning despotism. It is not needed nor fitting here, that a general argument should be made in favor of popular institutions; but there is one point, with its connections, not so hackneyed as most others, to which I ask a brief attention. It is the effort to place _capital_ on an equal footing with, if not above, _labor_, in the structure of government. It is assumed that labor is available only in connection with capital; that nobody labors unless somebody else, owning capital, somehow, by the use of it, induces him to labor. This assumed, it is next considered whether it is best that capital shall _hire_ laborers, and thus induce them to work by their own consent, or _buy_ them, and drive them to it without their consent.

His father wished him to enter business and, when he had graduated from the well-known Paris college, Ste. Barbe, sent him to Germany to learn the language. But the young man soon saw that he had no liking for commercial pursuits and entered the Paris School of Fine Arts, studying under Gleyre, as well as his father. He became a landscape painter, and visited, brush in hand, most of the French provinces. M. Hippolyte Peyrol, referring to him, writes me: \" He was remarked for the sincerity which he showed 273 REMINISCENCES OF ROSA BONHEUR in rendering the colour and character of the scenes which he painted.\" He was for many years a regular exhibitor in the Salon, and died in 1895, \" at the moment when he was at the height of a talent which was rapidly becoming that of a master.\" Rosa Bonheur's letters to the Verdiers begin with that of April 81, 1869: I am sure you will be pleased to hear that I am delighted with your son who is a worthy fellow and whom I am very glad to have as a companion in my sketching. What you will also like to know is that I am now certain he will have talent. I thought so when I saw his first attempts, and I have always encouraged him in the career he has chosen. He will be able, I believe, to make a reputation in landscape painting, notwithstanding the number of talented artists in this kind. What especially gives me hope for your son is that he is very simple and well understands that he must study nature ingenuously and honestly without stuffing his noddle with a heap of conventional ideas; that he must preserve his personal sentiment while seeking in others whatever may develop it.", "label": 11.33492576567243, "group": "Reminiscences of Rosa Bonheur"}

Winding upwards from the village, you came upon the entrance gates on the left of the road \u2014 great gates of wrought iron, with two smaller gates beside them. The lodges, built to match the house, stood a little back, one on each side the gates, roses and honeysuckles adorning the porches and lower windows.

The princess therefore wrote an affectionate letter to her brother, acquainting him of her situation, and begging his kind protection; but alas! the worthy prince had already been most unhappily imposed upon. For in the neighbourhood of Dorando lived the prince of Arvidoso, who by an intermarriage of the families entertained some hopes of succession to the estate of Dorando. The adherents therefore of the family of Arvidoso did all in their power to poison the ear and vex the noble spirit of the unsuspecting Dorando. The principal of these adherents were Don Stocaccio, Don Tipponi, and Don Rodomontado. These three never ceased to throw the most injurious suspicions upon the character of the absent princess. They exaggerated every imprudency in the conduct of Don Spiritoso,  so as to prevent any hope of the prince being reconciled to his marriage with the lady Maria.

Jean Bonheur, who lived in the time of Louis XIV, was a cook at Toulouse, then the cultured capital of Languedoc, the finest province of southern France. His son, Guillaume, exercised the same functions in the grand establishment of Mme. de Cazales, one of the aristocratic ladies of the period. Guillaume's son, Francois, mounted a step higher in the quality of his employer, though still remaining faithful to his sauces and his sauce pans. He became head cook of the celebrated Cambaceres family, whose members have made a reputation in pulpit oratory, law, and statesmanship. Here, however, the tradition was interrupted, for the next descent was destined to produce the head of a race of artists. Francois Bonheur, who lived from 1753 till 1829, married the daughter of an old invalided soldier that had warred in Germany under Louis XV. Her name was Eleonore Marie Perard. By her he had two children, the aunt and the father of Rosa Bonheur. The aunt, Elisabeth, better known in Rosa's letters, as we shall see, as \" Tatan, \" was probably born in 1780, although the lack of careful registration in those days makes the date somewhat uncertain. \" Tatan, \" it may be added, never married and lived to a good old age, dying only in 1873. \" She was a woman of lively imagination, of energetic character, and not always easy to get on with, \" writes her grand nephew, Hippolyte Peyrol, the sculptor, who was a boy of seventeen at the time of her death.", "label": 12.864811046404578, "group": "Reminiscences of Rosa Bonheur"}

From five o'clock to eight is on certain occasions a little eternity; but on such an occasion as this the interval could be only an eternity of pleasure.

The passage was a long one, and seemed to pervade the whole square basement of the Manor House. We traversed but one side of the square, however, and at the end of it she stopped, and put her candle down and opened a door. Here, the daylight reappeared, and I found myself in a small paved courtyard, the opposite side of which was formed by a detached dwelling-house, that looked as if it had once belonged to the manager or head clerk of the extinct brewery. There was a clock in the outer wall of this house. Like the clock in Miss Havisham's room, and like Miss Havisham's watch, it had stopped at twenty minutes to nine.  We went in at the door, which stood open, and into a gloomy room with a low ceiling, on the ground-floor at the back. There was some company in the room, and Estella said to me as she joined it, \"You are to go and stand there boy, till you are wanted.\" \"There\", being the window, I crossed to it, and stood \"there,\" in a very uncomfortable state of mind, looking out.", "label": -5.200737038209173, "group": "Great Expectations"}

The planter cuts his mark upon the ear, or brands his initials upon the side, and turns them into the swamps, to roam unrestricted within their almost limitless confines. They are the Spanish breed, small and spike-horned. I have known of droves being taken from Bayou Boeuf, but it is of very rare occurrence. The value of the best cows is about five dollars each. Two quarts at one milking, would be considered an unusual large quantity. They furnish little tallow, and that of a soft, inferior quality. Notwithstanding the great number of cows that throng the swamps, the planters are indebted to the North for their cheese and butter, which is purchased in the New-Orleans market. Salted beef is not an article of food either in the great house, or in the cabin.  Master Epps was accustomed to attend shooting matches for the purpose of obtaining what fresh beef he required. These sports occurred weekly at the neighboring village of Holmesville. Fat beeves are driven thither and shot at, a stipulated price being demanded for the privilege. The lucky marksman divides the flesh among his fellows, and in this manner the attending planters are supplied.  The great number of tame and untamed cattle which swarm the woods and swamps of Bayou Boeuf, most probably suggested that appellation to the French, inasmuch as the term, translated, signifies the creek or river of the wild ox.", "label": 5.760415816286659, "group": "Twelve Years a Slave"}

One of his feet was cased in folds of linen, as it rested on the soft velvet ottoman, speaking of gout as plainly as any foot ever spoke yet. It would seem--to look at the man as he sat there--that he had grown old before his time. And so he had. His years were barely nine and forty, yet in all save years, he was an aged man.  A noted character had been the Earl of Mount Severn. Not that he had been a renowned politician, or a great general, or an eminent statesman, or even an active member in the Upper House; not for any of these had the earl's name been in the mouths of men. But for the most reckless among the reckless, for the spendthrift among spendthrifts, for the gamester above all gamesters, and for a gay man outstripping the gay--by these characteristics did the world know Lord Mount Severn. It was said his faults were those of his head; that a better heart or a more generous spirit never beat in human form; and there was much truth in this.

If she did not remember, she yet strove to know me; and sometimes studied my features in a manner the most  touching. I considered this as the very crisis of her fate her only chance on this side Heaven, and scarce dared leave her for a single moment. I entrusted the care of Lady Arundell (whose situation, though more dangerous, was not so melancholy) to my daughter; fearful lest her youthful spirits should be injured by constantly beholding an object so affecting. But I had forgot that my own shattered constitution was not equal to the fatigue and anxiety of watching over my sister. I fell one evening into a succession of fainting fits; the servants conveyed me to bed; and the fear of alarming Lady Arundell hindered them from informing my daughter of my situation. My faintings at length gave place to a drowsiness so intense, I might call it a stupor. I remained thus for some hours, when I started with an indistinct idea of a heavy fall, and a deep groan. Terror roused, and collected in a moment, every dormant faculty. I rushed through the chamber which divided mine from my sister's; but I blamed myself for impetuosity  when I perceived all was profoundly silent in hers.", "label": 3.58351893845611, "group": "THE RECESS; OR A TALE OF OTHER TIMES."}

The Barrack and Hospital Improvement Com- mission inexplicably came to a standstill on Indian work. In April Miss Nishtindale discovered the truth: the War Office and the India Office had fallen out. The India office did not intend to have action proposed to it by the War Office, and the Suggestions had been pigeon-holed.  At this stage Lord Stanley became annoyed. It was seven months since the Commission, of which he was chairman, had reported, and nothing had been done. He considered that a reflection had been cast on his work. He went to see Sir Charles Wood and promised to support him in case of any criticism in the House and Sir Charles Wood then accepted the Suggestions. The conflict in dignity between the War Office and the India Office was solved by a phrase on the title-page; though the Indian Sanitary Commission had been a War Office Com- mission, the title-page stated that the Suggestions had been \"prepared by the said Commission in accordance with letters from the Secretary of State for India in Council.\"", "label": 5.906723318652891, "group": "Florence Nightingale"}

In the first forty days a boy had been with him. But after forty days without a fish the boy\u2019s parents had told him that the old man was now definitely and finally salao, which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone at their orders in another boat which caught three good fish the first week. It made the boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his skiff empty and he always went down to help him carry either the coiled lines or the gaff and harpoon and the sail that was furled around the mast. The sail was patched with flour sacks and, furled, it looked like the flag of permanent defeat.  The old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck. The brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its reflection on the tropic sea were on his cheeks. The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords. But none of these scars were fresh.
