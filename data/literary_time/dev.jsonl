I wanted to pick apples from these trees at the first possible moment. I argued that a sturdy three-year-old would have an advantage over its neighbor that was only two. However small this advantage, I wanted it in my business--my business being to make a profitable farm in quick time. The ten acres of the home lot were to be planted with three hundred Yellow Transparent, three hundred Duchess of Oldenburg, and one hundred mixed varieties for home use. I selected the Transparent and the Duchess on account of their disposition to bear early, and because they are good sellers in a near market, and because a fruit-wise friend was making money from an eight-year-old orchard of three thousand of these trees, and advised me not to neglect them.  My order called for thirty-four hundred three-year-old apple trees of the highest grade, to be delivered in good condition on the platform at Exeter for the lump sum of $550. The agreement had been made in August, and the trees were to be delivered as near the 20th of October as practicable. Apple trees comprised my entire planting for the autumn of 1895. I wanted to do much other work in that line, but it had to be left for a more convenient season. Hundreds of fruit trees, shade trees, and shrubs have since been planted at Four Oaks, but this first setting of thirty-four hundred apple trees was the most important as well as the most urgent.", "label": -1.0986122886681098, "group": "The fat of the land"}

Their virtues might be divided, as some have divided virtue itself, into Benevolence, Prudence, Fortitude, and Temperance; and from like motives of division: because, Benevolence proposes good ends, Prudence suggests the best means of attaining them, Fortitude enables us to encounter the discouragements that stand in our way, and Temperance repels, and over-comes the passions that obstruct our progress. Sir Armine brought with him, into holy orders, all the principle necessary to practise the precepts they enjoin. A sincere belief in those precepts formed, indeed, the most exalted ingredient in his worldly happiness; and the example of his life finely illustrated his doctrine, if we except the prime error that shaded his character a very strong tincture of bigotry in matters of religion.", "label": 11.859589741690137, "group": "FAMILY SECRETS LITERARY AND DOMESTIC.

The author of these Travels, Mr. Lemuel Gulliver, is my ancient and intimate friend; there is likewise some relation between us on the mother\u2019s side. About three years ago, Mr. Gulliver growing weary of the concourse of curious people coming to him at his house in Redriff, made a small purchase of land, with a convenient house, near Newark, in Nottinghamshire, his native country; where he now lives retired, yet in good esteem among his neighbours.  Although Mr. Gulliver was born in Nottinghamshire, where his father dwelt, yet I have heard him say his family came from Oxfordshire; to confirm which, I have observed in the churchyard at Banbury in that county, several tombs and monuments of the Gullivers.  Before he quitted Redriff, he left the custody of the following papers in my hands, with the liberty to dispose of them as I should think fit. I have carefully perused them three times. The style is very plain and simple; and the only fault I find is, that the author, after the manner of travellers, is a little too circumstantial. There is an air of truth apparent through the whole; and indeed the author was so distinguished for his veracity, that it became a sort of proverb among his neighbours at Redriff, when any one affirmed a thing, to say, it was as true as if Mr. Gulliver had spoken it.", "label": 11.620486946555074, "group": "Gulliver's Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World"}

Perhaps he who has a large fortune may not be so happy as he who has a small one; but that must proceed from other causes than from his having the large fortune: for, coeteris paribus, he who is rich in a civilized society, must be happier than he who is poor; as riches, if properly used, (and it is a man's own fault if they are not,) must be productive of the highest advantages.

His mother, herself a woman of some education, remarked her son's natural abilities, and did her best to cultivate and develop them. The young Raymond showed his first aptitude for drawing by imitating the ornaments in butter and sugar which his father executed in the Toulouse kitchen for the dining table of the Cambaceres family, a curious example of Taine's favourite doctrine of the influence of surroundings on budding intellect. His parents then sent him to the drawing school at Bordeaux, where, under the clever tuition of Lacour, of whom more will be said farther on in this biography, he quickly became a distinguished pupil; and, after completing his studies, he began, while still young, to teach in his turn. It was a modest existence that he entered upon; for, at that time, artists did not enjoy the favour accorded them today. Among Raymond Bonheur's pupils was a young orphan girl, who was being brought up in a well-to-do Bordeaux family, that of M. Dublan de Lahet, son of a royal treasurer under Louis XV, and who had been a page of Queen Marie Antoinette. Her name was Sophie Marquis; and she had been born at Altona, near Hamburg, in 1797. Soon the professor and his pupil fell in love with each other, and on May 21, 1821, they were married.", "label": 10.721290648040219, "group": "Reminiscences of Rosa Bonheur"}

His hands were the hands of a man accustomed to pruning his own trees, cutting his own hay, and splitting his own firewood. In such bitter cold of winter, the pink of his round, clean-shaven, very English face would all but glow, and if he were hatless or without a wig, his high forehead and thinning hairline made the whole of the face look rounder still. The hair, light brown in color, was full about the ears. The chin was firm, the nose sharp, almost birdlike. But it was the dark, perfectly arched brows and keen blue eyes that gave the face its vitality. Years afterward, recalling this juncture in his life, he would describe himself as looking rather like a short, thick Archbishop of Canterbury. As befitting a studious lawyer from Braintree, Adams was a \"plain dressing\" man. His oft-stated pleasures were his family, his farm, his books and writing table, a convivial pipe and cup of coffee (now that tea was no longer acceptable), or preferably a glass of good Madeira.", "label": -5.480638923341991, "group": "John Adams"}

As vice and folly are generally connected, replied Sir John, he was weak enough to inform against himself by a letter which he wrote to me at Paris, some time after his marriage; and concluded it with presenting lady Miller's compliments, and hoping that notwithstanding what had passed, we might still be friends, and live upon good terms IN my answer, I told him that though sighting had formerly been my profession, I was neither a bully nor a bravo, and if he could acquit himself with honour, of a breach of faith to a woman of unquestioned merit, I was ready to accord him the friendship he desired; but as I looked upon that to be impossible, I hoped he would at least be ready to afford me the only satisfaction that remained in his power to offer or mine to receive. That I should leave Paris in a few days, and call upon him, as soon as I arrived in London. I SAW his servant near this house, when I alighted, and I have reason to think he was placed there, to watch my coming; as Sir James and his lady set out in a few minutes after for Paris. And I think there now ramains nothing, but to wish my dear Lucy joy of her escape, from such a contemptible animal.", "label": -4.77912349311153, "group": "THE Delicate Distress A NOVEL: IN LETTERS."}

But it was now high time to talk of this to my husband, which, however, was not the greatest difficulty before me; for after this and other chat had taken up some time, the young fool began her tattle again; and two or three times she brought it in, that I was so like a lady that she had the honour to know at the other end of the town, that she could not put that lady out of her mind when I was by, and once or twice I fancied the girl was ready to cry; by and by she was at it again, and at last I plainly saw tears in her eyes; upon which I asked her if the lady was dead, because she seemed to be in some concern for her. She made me much easier by her answer than ever she did before; she said she did not really know, but she believed she was dead.", "label": -0.9555114450274363, "group": "Roxana: The Fortunate Mistress"}
