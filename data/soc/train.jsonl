He smiled as they talked about her. Having brought her to mind, he could see their gaiety, her ingenuous perversity, which made him smile without irritation. Poor girl! Those photographs meant so much to her that she kept them hanging on the wall. She took such delight in being admired on the street that she wanted him to keep track of the glances she received. As he related all this, he realized that there was nothing there to offend anyone who had declared that she was no more than an amusement for him. Granted, he had omitted from his account all his observations and experiences, but for the moment, what had been omitted no longer mattered.

This was a very happy event for the country, and had been long looked forward to by the people, sometimes doubtfully, but always hopefully. But the great victory that had been won found the people of Georgia prostrate. The little property that they possessed when the war began had either been spent in maintaining the struggle, or well-nigh destroyed by the raids of the British and Tories. In the larger communities of Savannah and Augusta, the citizens had the resources of trade and commerce to fall back on, but in the smaller settlements and rural districts the condition of the inhabitants bordered on destitution.", "label": "realism", "title": "Stories of Georgia", "author": "Harris", "group": "Harris_Stories_of_Georgia", "id": 25}

He did not think it was wise for any one to steal anything from anybody where the act of taking or profiting was directly and plainly considered stealing. That was unwise--dangerous--hence wrong. There were so many situations wherein what one might do in the way of taking or profiting was open to discussion and doubt. Morality varied, in his mind at least, with conditions, if not climates. Here, in Philadelphia, the tradition (politically, mind you--not generally) was that the city treasurer might use the money of the city without interest so long as he returned the principal intact. The city treasury and the city treasurer were like a honey-laden hive and a queen bee around which the drones--the politicians--swarmed in the hope of profit. The one disagreeable thing in connection with this transaction with Stener was that neither Butler, Mollenhauer nor Simpson, who were the actual superiors of Stener and Strobik, knew anything about it.

By a gesture or a nod of the head Aunt Nancy was informed of what was going on. She smiled, and grew more spirited in her talk, rattling away and laughing as she gave exaggerated accounts of the recent defeats of the Tories. As she talked, she stirred the bubbling soap, and kept her keen eyes on the crack where the eavesdropper had been seen. Suddenly she dashed a ladleful of boiling soap through the crack full into the face of the intruder. It was so quickly and deftly done, that the eavesdropper had no time to dodge the scalding stuff. He received the full benefit of it Blinded and half crazed by the pain, he howled and screamed at a tremendous rate. Aunt Nancy went out, and, after amusing herself at his expense, bound him fast and held him prisoner. The probability is that the next day she H tucked up her petticoats, shouldered her gun, and compelled the unlucky Tory to ford the river ahead of her; and that, once on the other side, she kept in constant communication with the Clarkes and with other partisans of the American cause.", "label": "realism", "title": "Stories of Georgia", "author": "Harris", "group": "Harris_Stories_of_Georgia", "id": 74}

The editor of the Afro-American Banner, whose office had been quietly garrisoned for several nights by armed negroes, became frightened, and disappeared from the town between two suns. The conspirators were jubilant at the complete success of their plans. It only remained for them to so direct this aroused public feeling that it might completely accomplish the desired end,--to change the political complexion of the city government and assure the ascendency of the whites until the amendment should go into effect. A revolution, and not a riot, was contemplated. With this end in view, another meeting was called at Carteret's office. \"We are now ready,\" announced General Belmont, \"for the final act of this drama. We must decide promptly, or events may run away from us.\" \"What do you suggest?\" asked Carteret. \"Down in the American tropics,\" continued the general, \"they have a way of doing things.

It was information in the rough,--it was dark and puzzling; but Newman was neither helpless nor afraid. Valentin had evidently meant to put him in possession of a powerful instrument, though he could not be said to have placed the handle very securely within his grasp. But if he had not really told him the secret, he had at least given him the clew to it--a clew of which that queer old Mrs. Bread held the other end. Mrs. Bread had always looked to Newman as if she knew secrets; and as he apparently enjoyed her esteem, he suspected she might be induced to share her knowledge with him. So long as there was only Mrs. Bread to deal with, he felt easy. As to what there was to find out, he had only one fear--that it might not be bad enough. Then, when the image of the marquise and her son rose before him again, standing side by side, the old woman\u2019s hand in Urbain\u2019s arm, and the same cold, unsociable fixedness in the eyes of each, he cried out to himself that the fear was groundless.", "label": "realism", "title": "The American", "author": "James", "group": "James_The_American", "id": 76}

You may have trouble right here in Philadelphia after you get it--they\u2019re pretty powerful, you know. Are you sure just where you can place it?\u201d \u201cYes, I\u2019m sure,\u201d replied Cowperwood. \u201cWell, the best thing in my judgment is not to say anything at all.

{"text": "Now the broad road was crossed. The lane began, smoky and dark. Women in shawls and men's tweed caps hurried by. Men hung over the palings; the children played in the doorways. A low hum came from the mean little cottages. In some of them there was a flicker of light, and a shadow, crab-like, moved across the window. Laura bent her head and hurried on. She wished now she had put on a coat. How her frock shone! And the big hat with the velvet streamer - if only it was another hat! Were the people looking at her? They must be. It was a mistake to have come; she knew all along it was a mistake. Should she go back even now? No, too late. This was the house. It must be. A dark knot of people stood outside. Beside the gate an old, old woman with a crutch sat in a chair, watching. She had her feet on a newspaper. The voices stopped as Laura drew near. The group parted. It was as though she was expected, as though they had known she was coming here.", "label": "soc", "title": "\"The Garden Party\"", "author": "Mansfield", "group": "Mansfield_\"The_Garden_Party\"", "id": 197}
{"text": "I had gone to no place where the roads were frozen and hard as iron, where it was clear cold and dry and the snow was dry and powdery and hare-tracks in the snow and the peasants took off their hats and called you Lord and there was good hunting. I had gone to no such place but to the smoke of cafes and nights when the room whirled and you needed to look at the wall to make it stop, nights in bed, drunk, when you knew that that was all there was, and the strange excitement of waking and not knowing who it was with you, and the world all unreal in the dark and so exciting that you must resume again unknowing and not caring in the night, sure that this was all and all and all and not caring. Suddenly to care very much and to sleep to wake with it sometimes morning and all that had been there gone and everything sharp and hard and clear and sometimes a dispute about the cost. Sometimes still pleasant and fond and warm and breakfast and lunch. Sometimes all niceness gone and glad to get out on the street but always another day starting and then another night. I tried to tell about the night and the difference between the night and the day and how the night was better unless the day was very clean and cold and I could not tell it; as I cannot tell it now. But if you have had it you know.", "label": "soc", "title": "A Farewell to Arms", "author": "Hemingway", "group": "Hemingway_A_Farewell_to_Arms", "id": 198}

She left her love for her brother, with her eyes full of tears; and she and Sissy went away until later in the afternoon. Mr. Gradgrind arrived within an hour afterwards. He too had encountered no one whom he knew; and was now sanguine with Sleary\u2019s assistance, of getting his disgraced son to Liverpool in the night.", "label": "realism", "title": "Hard Times", "author": "Dickens", "group": "Dickens_Hard_Times", "id": 199}
