The carr\u00e9 doors were yet open: I thought he was probably going to water the orange-trees in the tubs, after his occasional custom; on reaching the court, however, he took an abrupt turn and made for the berceau and the first-classe glass door. There, in that first classe I was, thence I had been watching him; but there I could not find courage to await his approach. He had turned so suddenly, he strode so fast, he looked so strange; the coward within me grew pale, shrank and--not waiting to listen to reason, and hearing the shrubs crush and the gravel crunch to his advance--she was gone on the wings of panic. Nor did I pause till I had taken sanctuary in the oratory, now empty. Listening there with beating pulses, and an unaccountable, undefined apprehension, I heard him pass through all the schoolrooms, clashing the doors impatiently as he went; I heard him invade the refectory which the \"lecture pieuse\" was now holding under hallowed constraint; I heard him pronounce these words--\"O\u00f9 est Mademoiselle Lucie?\" And just as, summoning my courage, I was preparing to go down and do what, after all, I most wished to do in the world--viz., meet him--the wiry voice of St. Pierre replied glibly and falsely, \"Elle est au lit.\" And he passed, with the stamp of vexation, into the corridor.", "label": "realism", "title": "Vilette", "author": "Bronte", "group": "Bronte_Vilette", "id": 400}

Very likely it was because Mark Twain lived there for a long time and there had been a kind of connection between Mark Twain and a Presbyterian or a Congregational or a Baptist minister of Hartford. Also there was a kind of connection between Mark Twain and the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers and John Stockton had been fooling along, up and down the Mississippi River for six months on that day when he got off the train at the Illinois town bound for Old Harbor.

Or because I was getting used to it already? I think not. For it recurred again, several times, and each time less bad than the time before, and finally subsided altogether so that I was able to get to sleep again more or less reassured. But before getting to sleep again I had time to remember that the pain in question was not altogether new to me. For I had felt it before, in my bathroom, when giving my son his enema. But then it had only attacked me once and never recurred, till now. And I went to sleep again wondering, by way of lullaby, whether it had been the same knee then as the one which had just excruciated me, or the other. And that is a thing I have never been able to determine. And my son too, when asked, was incapable of telling me which of my two knees I had rubbed in front of him, with iodex, the night we left. And I went to sleep again a little reassured, saying, It's a touch of neuralgia brought on by all the tramping and trudging and the chill damp nights, and promising myself to procure a packet of thermogene wool, with the pretty demon on the outside, at the first opportunity.", "label": "soc", "title": "Molloy", "author": "Beckett", "group": "Beckett_Molloy", "id": 471}

With the other children one could hear, some distance off, their feet flopping in the two-inch dust. Karintha's running was a whir. It had the sound of the red dust that sometimes makes a spiral in the road, At dusk, during the hush just after the sawmill had closed down, and before any of the women had started their supper-getting-ready songs, her voice, high-pitched, shrill, would put one's ears to itching. But no one ever thought to make her stop because of it. She stoned the cows, and beat her dog, and fought the other children.... Even the preacher, who caught her at her mischief, told himself that she was as innocently lovely as a November cotton flower. Already, rumors were out about her. Homes in Georgia are most often built on the two room plan. In one, you cook and eat, in the other you sleep, and there love goes on.

In this room she was always on her guard. It was jolly after roaming slowly across the courtyard towards the unfailing unchanging beauty of the great grey pillars, pigeon-garlanded, to wander through the out-branching hall to where the lame commissionaire held open the magic door, and fly along the passage and break in here, permitted, cold and grimy and ruffled from the street, and emerge washed and hatless and rested, to saunter down the corridor and see ahead, before becoming one of them, the dim various forms sitting in little circles of soft yellow light under the high mysterious dome. But in one unguarded moment in this room, all these women would turn into acquaintances, and the spell of the museum, springing forth perhaps for a while, intensified, would disappear for ever. They would turn it into themselves, varying and always in the end, in silence, the same. In solitude it remained unvarying yet never twice alike, casting its large increasing charm upon them as they moved distant and unknown.", "label": "soc", "title": "Deadlock", "author": "Richardson", "group": "Richardson_Deadlock", "id": 496}

Will it annoy you if she is left behind?\" \"I would far rather she went, sir.\" \"Then off for your bonnet, and back like a flash of lightning!\" cried he to Adele.

To walk in money through the night crowd, protected by money, lulled by money, dulled by money, the crowd itself a money, the breath money, no least single object anywhere that is not money, money, money everywhere and still not enough, and then no money or a little money or less money or more money, but money, always money, and if you have money or you don't have money it is the money that counts and money makes money, but what makes money make money?", "label": "soc", "title": "Tropic of Capricorn", "author": "Miller", "group": "Miller_Tropic_of_Capricorn", "id": 593}

Her conceit would soon be overawed by the actual inspection of his books. Mrs. Stelling, in her pressing invitation, did not mention a longer time than a week for Maggie's stay; but Mr. Stelling, who took her between his knees, and asked her where she stole her dark eyes from, insisted that she must stay a fortnight. Maggie thought Mr. Stelling was a charming man, and Mr. Tulliver was quite proud to leave his little wench where she would have an opportunity of showing her cleverness to appreciating strangers. So it was agreed that she should not be fetched home till the end of the fortnight. \"Now, then, come with me into the study, Maggie,\" said Tom, as their father drove away.", "label": "realism", "title": "The Mill on the Floss", "author": "Eliot", "group": "Eliot_The_Mill_on_the_Floss", "id": 594}
{"text": "I walked about the neighborhood, thinking of this strange colloquy, and wondering what had become of Christine. Then I thought of Mara sobbing in the dark street, and for a moment I had an uncomfortable, crazy thought-that, perhaps at that very moment when I was tearing myself away from Mara, Christine was also sobbing in her sleep in some dreary hotel room. From time to time rumors had reached me that she was no longer with her husband, that she had taken to wandering from place to place, always on her own. She had never written me a line. For her it was a final separation. \"Forever,\" she had said. Still, as I walked about at night thinking of her, whenever I stopped before the old house on the Ile St. Louis and looked up at the window, it seemed unbelievable that she had relinquished me forever, in mind and heart. We should have taken the fat girl's advice and married, that was the sad truth. If I could only have divined where she was, I would have taken a train and gone to her, immediately. Those sobs in the dark, they rang in my ears. How could I know that she, Christine, was not sobbing too, now, this very moment? What time was it! I began to think of strange cities where it was night now, or early morning: lonely, Godforsaken places, where women bereft and abandoned were shedding tears of woe. I got out my notebook and wrote down the hour, the date, the place . . . And Mara, where was she now? She too had dropped out, forever. Strange how some enter one's life for just a moment or two, and then are gone, forever. And yet there is nothing accidental about such meetings.", "label": "soc", "title": "Quiet Days in Clichy", "author": "Miller", "group": "Miller_Quiet_Days_in_Clichy", "id": 595}

The citizens of Endor objected to our going in there. They do not mind dirt; they do not mind rags; they do not mind vermin; they do not mind barbarous ignorance and savagery; they do not mind a reasonable degree of starvation, but they do like to be pure and holy before their god, whoever he may be, and therefore they shudder and grow almost pale at the idea of Christian lips polluting a spring whose waters must descend into their sanctified gullets. We had no wanton desire to wound even their feelings or trample upon their prejudices, but we were out of water, thus early in the day, and were burning up with thirst. It was at this time, and under these circumstances, that I framed an aphorism which has already become celebrated. I said: \u201cNecessity knows no law.\u201d We went in and drank. We got away from the noisy wretches, finally, dropping them in squads and couples as we filed over the hills--the aged first, the infants next, the young girls further on; the strong men ran beside us a mile, and only left when they had secured the last possible piastre in the way of bucksheesh.

It would be something to mention to-morrow. But then one would have to confess that one had not watched. She opened her window and looked out. It was a warm night ; but perhaps this was not the right part of the sky. The sky looked intelligent. She sat in front of the window. Very soon now it would not be too early to light the gas and go to bed. No one had ever seen a comet rushing through space. There was nothing to look for. Only people who knew the whole map of the sky would recognize the presence of the comet. . . . But there was a sort of calming joy in watching even a small piece of a sky that others were watching too ; it was one's own sky because one was a human being. Knowing of the sky and even very ignorantly a little of the things that made its effects, gave the most quiet sense of being human; and a sense of other human beings, not as separate disturbing personalities, but as sky-watchers", "label": "soc", "title": "Deadlock", "author": "Richardson", "group": "Richardson_Deadlock", "id": 597}

Their challenge had sent her to the window when she came into the room. It had made her feel like a trespasser. Now she was caught.
