And then \nA deep up-pouring from some saltier well \nWithin me, bursts its watery syllable.\n\n\t\t\tII.\nA red bird flies across the golden floor.\nIt is a red bird that seeks out his choir\nAmong the choirs of wind and wet and wing.\nA torrent will fall from him when he 6nds.\nShall I uncrumple this much-crumpled thing?\nI am a man of fortune greeting heirs;\nFor it has come that thus I greet the spring.\nThese choirs of welcome choir for me farewell.\nNo spring can follow past meridian.\nYet you persist with anecdotal bliss\nTo make believe a starry connaissance.\n\n\t\t\tIII.\nIs it for nothing, then, that old Chinese\nSat tittivating by their mountain pools\nOr in the Yangste studied out their beards?\nI shall not play the flat historic scale.\nYou know how Utamaro's beauties sought\nThe end of love in their all-speaking braids.\nYou know the mountainous coiffures of Bath.\nAlas! Have all the barbers lived in vain\nThat not one curl in nature has survived?\nWhy, without pity on these studious ghosts,\nDo you come dripping in your hair from sleep?\n\n\t\t\tIV.\nThis luscious and impeccable fruit of life\nFalls, it appears, of its own weight to earth.\nWhen you were Eve, its acrid juice was sweet,\nUntasted, in its heavenly, orchard air - \nAn apple serves as well as any skull\nTo be the book in which to read a round,\nAnd is as excellent, in that it is composed\nOf what, like skulls, comes rotting back to ground.\nBut it excels in this that as the fruit\nOf love, it is a book too mad to read\nBefore one merely reads to pass the time.\n\n\t\t\tV.\nIn the high West there burns a furious star.\nIt is for fiery boys that star was set\nAnd for sweet-smelling virgins close to them.\nThe measure of the intensity of love\nIs measure, also, of the verve of earth.\nFor me, the firefly's quick, electric stroke\nTicks tediously the time of one more year.\nAnd you? Remember how the crickets came\nOut of their mother grass, like little kin\nIn the pale nights, when your first imagery\nFound inklings of your bond to all that dust.\n\n\t\t\tVI.\nIf men at forty will be painting lakes\nThe ephemeral blues must merge for them in one,\nThe basic slate, the universal hue.\nThere is a substance in us that prevails.\nBut in oar amours amorists discern\nSuch fluctuations that their scrivening\nIs breathless to attend each quirky turn.\nWhen amorists grow bald, then amours shrink\nInto the compass and curriculum\nOf introspective exiles, lecturing.\nIt is a theme for Hyacinth alone.\n\n\t\t\tVII.\nThe mules that angels ride come slowly down \nThe blazing passes, from beyond the sun. \nDescensions of their tinkling bells arrive. \nThese muleteers are dainty of their way. \nMeantime, centurions guffaw and beat \nTheir shrilling tankards on the table-boards. \nThis parable, in sense, amounts to this: \nThe honey of heaven may or may not come, \nBut that of earth both comes and goes at once. \nSuppose these couriers brought amid their train \nA damsel heightened by eternal bloom. . .\n\n\t\t\tVIII.\nLike a dull scholar, I behold, in love,\nAn ancient aspect touching a new mind.\nIt comes, it blooms, it bears its fruit and dies.\nThis trivial trope reveals a way of truth.\nOur bloom is gone. We are the fruit thereof.\nTwo golden gourds distended on our vines,\nWe hang like warty squashes, streaked and rayed,\nInto the autumn weather, splashed with frost,\nDistorted by hale fatness, turned grotesque.\nThe laughing sky will see the two of us\nWashed into rinds by rotting winter rains.\n\n\t\t\tIX.\nIn verses wild with motion, full of din, \nLoudened by cries, by clashes, quick and sure \nAs the deadly thought of men accomplishing \nTheir curious fates in war, come, celebrate \nThe faith of forty, ward of Cupido. \nMost venerable heart, the lustiest conceit \nIs not too lusty for your broadening. \nI quiz all sounds, all thoughts, all everything \nFor the music and manner of the paladins \nTo make oblation fit. Where shall I find \nBravura adequate to this great hymn?\n\n\t\t\tX.\nThe fops of fancy in their poems leave\nMemorabilia of the mystic spouts,\nSpontaneously watering their gritty soils.\nI am a yeoman, as such fellows go.\nI know no magic trees, no balmy boughs,\nNo silver-ruddy, gold-vermilion fruits.\nBut, after all, I know a tree that bears\nA semblance to the thing I have in mind.\nIt stands gigantic, with a certain tip\nTo which all birds come sometime in their time.\nBut when they go that tip still tips the tree.\n\n\t\t\tXI.\nIf sex were all, then every trembling hand\nCould make us squeak, like dolls, the wished-for words.\nBut note the unconscionable treachery of fate,\nThat makes us weep, laugh, grunt and groan, and shout\nDoleful heroics, pinching gestures forth\nFrom madness or delight, without regard\nTo that first, foremost law. Anguishing hour!\nLast night, we sat beside a pool of pink,\nClippered with lilies, scudding the bright chromes,\nKeen to the point of starlight, while a frog\nBoomed from his very belly, odious chords.\n\n\t\t\tXII.\nA blue pigeon it is, that circles the blue sky,\nOn side-long wing, around and round and round.\nA white pigeon it is, that flutters to the ground,\nGrown tired of flight. Like a dark rabbi, I\nObserved, when young, the nature of mankind,\nIn lordly study. Every day, I found\nMan proved a gobbet in my mincing world.\nLike a rose rabbi, later, I pursued,\nAnd still pursue, the origin and course\nOf love, but until now I never knew\nThat fluttering things have so distinct a shade.\n", "title": "Le monocle de mon oncle", "author": "STEVENS_WALLACE", "group": "STEVENS_WALLACE", "id": 287}
