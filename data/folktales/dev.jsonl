The Christmas Eve was nearing its close, and they religiously believed that, should he pass away at its synchronism with the Christmas morning, he would escape purgatory, and directly enter paradise. The church clock began to strike twelve. The wife took the bolster from under the dying man's head and pressed it down on his face; the daughter seated herself on his breast; and their purpose accomplished; no secret being made of the deed -- no wonder manifested -- no notice taken. Was this murder? So far from possessing murder's primary condition -- malice -- it was done in all affection and piety. The husband and father could not survive another hour; a moment's quickened suffering would secure to him (so the simple women imagined) a painless eternity.

{"label": "500", "text": "Once upon a time there was a poor woman who had an only daughter, named Helen, a very lazy girl. One day when she had refused to do a single thing, her mother took her down to the banks of a stream and began to strike her fingers with a flat stone, just as you do in beating linen to wash it. The girl cried a good deal. A prince, Lord of the Red Castle, happened at that moment to pass by, and inquired as to the cause of such treatment, for it horrified him that a mother should so ill-use her child. 'Why should I not punish her?' answered the woman. 'The idle girl can do nothing but spin hemp into gold thread.' 'Really?' cried he. 'Does she really know how to spin gold thread out of hemp? If that be so, sell her to me.' 'Willingly; how much will you give me for her?' 'Half a measure of gold.' 'Take her,' said the mother; and she gave him her daughter as soon as the money was paid. The prince placed the girl behind him on the saddle, put spurs to his horse, and took her home. On reaching the Red Castle, the prince led Helen into a room filled from floor to ceiling with hemp, and having supplied her with distaff and spinning wheel, said, 'When you have spun all this hemp into gold thread I will make you my wife.' Then he went out, locking the door after him. On finding herself a prisoner, the poor girl wept as if her heart would break. Suddenly she saw a very odd looking little man seated on the window sill. He wore a red cap, and his boots were made of some strange sort of material. 'Why do you weep so?' he asked. 'I cannot help it,' she replied, 'I am but a miserable slave. I have been ordered to spin all this hemp into gold thread, but it is impossible, I can never do it, and I know not what will become of me.' I will do it for you in three days, on condition that at the end of that time you guess my right name, and tell me what the boots I am wearing now are made of.' Without for one moment reflecting as to whether she would be able to guess aright she consented. The uncanny little man burst out laughing, and taking her distaff set to work at once. All day as the distaff moved the hemp grew visibly less, while the skein of gold thread became larger and larger. The little man spun all the time, and, without stopping an instant, explained to Helen how to make thread of pure gold. As night drew on he tied up the skein, saying to the girl, 'Well, do you know my name yet? Can you tell me what boots are made of?' Helen replied that she could not, upon which he grinned and disappeared through the window. She then sat and looked at the sky, and thought, and thought, and thought, and lost herself in conjecturing as to what the little man's name might be, and in trying to guess what was the stuff his boots were made of. Were they of leather? or perhaps plaited rushes? or straw? or cast iron? No, they did not look like anything of that sort. And as to his name -- that was a still more difficult problem to solve. 'What shall I call him?' said she to herself -- 'John? Or Henry? Who knows? perhaps it is Paul or Joseph.' These thoughts so filled her mind that she forgot to eat her dinner. Her meditations were interrupted by cries and groans from outside, where she saw an old man with white hair sitting under the castle wall. 'Miserable old man that I am,' cried he; 'I die of hunger and thirst, but no one pities my sufferings.' Helen hastened to give him her dinner, and told him to come next day, which he promised to do. After again thinking for some time what answers she should give the little old man, she fell asleep on the hemp. The little old man did not fail to make his appearance the first thing next morning, and remained all day spinning the gold thread. The work progressed before their eyes, and it was only when evening came that he repeated his questions. Not receiving a satisfactory answer, he vanished in a fit of mocking laughter. Helen sat down by the window to think; but think as she might, no answer to these puzzling questions occurred to her. While thus wondering the hungry old man again came by, and she gave him her dinner. She was heart-sick and her eyes were full of tears, for she thought she would never guess the spinner's name, nor of what stuff his boots were made, unless perhaps God would help her. 'Why are you so sad?' asked the old man when he had eaten and drunk; 'tell me the cause of you grief, dear lady.' For a long time she would not tell him, thinking it would be useless; but at last, yielding to his entreaties, she gave a full account of the conditions under which the gold thread was made, explaining that unless she could answer the little old man's questions satisfactorily she feared some great misfortune would befall her. The old man listened attentively, then, nodding his head, he said: 'In coming through the forest today I passed close to a large pile of burning wood, round which were placed nine iron pots. A little man in a red cap was running and jumping over them, singing these words: My sweet friend, fair Helen, at the Red Castle near, Two days and two nights seeks my name to divine, She'll never find out, so the third night 'tis clear My sweet friend, fair Helen, can't fail to be mine. Hurrah! for my name is Kinkach Martinko, Hurrah! for my boots are of doggies' skin O! 'Now that is exactly what you want to know, my dear girl; so do not forget, and you are saved.' And with these words the old man vanished. Helen was greatly astonished, but she took care to fix in her memory all the good fellow had told her, and then went to sleep, feeling that she could face tomorrow without fear. One the third day, very early in the morning, the little old man appeared set busily to work, for he knew that all the hemp must be spun before sunset, and that then he should be able to claim his rights. When evening came all the hemp was gone, and the room shone with the brightness of the golden thread. As soon as his work was done, the queer little old man with the red cap drew himself up with a great deal of assurance, and with his hand in his pockets strutted up and down before Helen, ordering her to tell him his right name to say of what stuff the boots were made; but he felt certain that she would not be able to answer aright. 'Your name is Kinkach Martinko, and your boots are made of dogskin,' she replied without the slightest hesitation. At these words he spun round on the floor like a bobbin, tore out his hair beat his breast with rage, roaring so that the very walls trembled. 'It is lucky for you that you have guessed. If you had not, I should have torn you to pieces on this very spot:' so saying he rushed out of the window like a whirlwind. Helen felt deeply grateful towards the old man who had told her the answers, and hoped to be able to thank him in person. But he never appeared again. The Prince of the Red Castle was very pleased with her for having accomplished her task so punctually and perfectly, and he married her as he had promised. Helen was truly thankful to have escaped the dangers that had threatened her, and her happiness as a princess was greater than she had dared hope. She had, too, such a good stock of gold thread that she never had occasion to spin any more all her life long. Herdsmen, translated by Emily J.

As this had to be done, I had no opportunity of paying you a visit. To this the Master answered, 'Not now only is your daughter virtuous, but virtuous she was in days of yore; and as you have tested her now, so you tested her in those days. And at the man's request he told an old-world tale: Once upon a time, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta was a tree spirit. This same pious greengrocer took it into his head to test his daughter. He led her into the woods, and seized her by the hand, making as though he had conceived a passion for her. And as she cried out in woe, he addressed her in the words of the first stanza: All the world's on pleasure bent; Ah, my baby innocent! Now I've caught you, pray don't cry; As the town does, so do I. When she heard it, she answered, 'Dear Father, I am a maid, and I know not the ways of sin'; and weeping she uttered the second stanza: He that should keep me safe from all distress, The same betrays me in my loneliness; My father, who should be my sure defense, Here in the forest offers violence. And the greengrocer, after testing his daughter thus, took her home, and gave her in marriage to a young man.

Two fellows once came to Huy, who pretended to be exceedingly fatigued, and when they had supped would not retire to a sleeping room, but begged their host would allow them to take a nap on the hearth. But the maidservant, who did not like the looks of the two guests, remained by the kitchen door and peeped through a chink, when she saw that one of them drew a thief's hand from his pocket, the fingers of which, after having rubbed them with an ointment, he lighted, and they all burned except one. Again they held this finger to the fire, but still it would not burn, at which they appeared much surprised, and one said, 'There must surely be some one in the house who is not yet asleep.' They then hung the hand with its four burning fingers by the chimney, and went out to call their associates. But the maid followed them instantly and made the door fast, then ran upstairs, where the landlord slept, that she might wake him, but was unable, notwithstanding all her shaking and calling. In the meantime the thieves had returned and were endeavoring to enter the house by a window, but the maid cast them down from the ladder. They then took a different course, and would have forced an entrance, had it not occurred to the maid that the burning fingers might probably be the cause of her master's profound sleep. Impressed with this idea she ran to the kitchen, and blew them out, when the master and his men-servants instantly awoke, and soon drove away the robbers. In the village of Alveringen there formerly lived a sorceress, who had a thief's finger, over which nine masses had been read. For being acquainted with the sacristan, she had wrapt it in a cloth and laid it on the altar, telling him it was a relic. With this finger she performed wonderful things. When she had lighted it -- for such fingers burn like a candle -- everyone in the house where she might be was put to sleep. She would then steal money and everything else that she fancied, until she was at last detected, and the stolen property found in her possession.", "title": "Thief's Foot -- Thief's Hand -- Thief's Finger", "id": 333}

They traveled and traveled and could never see a house. It began to be dark, and they were hungry. At last they saw a light and made for it; it turned out to be a house. They knocked at the door, and a woman came to it, who said, 'What do you want?' They said, 'Please let us in and give us something to eat.' The woman said, 'I can't do that, as my man is a giant, and he would kill you if he comes home.' They begged hard. 'Let us stop for a little while,' said they, 'and we will go away before he comes.' So she took them in, and set them down before the fire, and gave them milk and bread; but just as they had begun to eat, a great knock came to the door, and a dreadful voice said: Fee, fie, fo, fum, I smell the blood of some earthly one. 'Who have you there, wife?' 'Eh,' said the wife, 'it's three poor lassies cold and hungry, and they will go away. Ye won't touch, 'em, man.' He said nothing, but ate up a big supper, and ordered them to stay all night. Now he had three lassies of his own, and they were to sleep in the same bed with the three strangers. The youngest of the three strange lassies was called Molly Whuppie, and she was very clever. She noticed that before they went to bed the giant put straw ropes round her neck and her sisters', and round his own lassies' necks, he put gold chains. So Molly took care and did not fall asleep, but waited till she was sure everyone was sleeping sound. Then she slipped out of bed, and took the straw ropes off her own and her sisters' necks, and took the gold chains off the giant's lassies. She then put the straw ropes on the giant's lassies and the gold on herself and her sisters, and lay down. And in the middle of the night up rose the giant, armed with a great club, and felt for the necks with the straw. It was dark. He took his own lassies out of the bed on to the floor, and battered them until they were dead, and then lay down again, thinking he had managed finely. Molly thought it time she and her sisters were off and away, so she wakened them and told them to be quiet, and they slipped out of the house. They all got out safe, and they ran and ran, and never stopped until morning, when they saw a grand house before them. It turned out to be a king's house; so Molly went in, and told her story to the king. He said, 'Well, Molly, you are a clever girl, and you have managed well; but, if you would manage better, and go back, and steal the giant's sword that hangs on the back of his bed, I would give your eldest sister my eldest son to marry.' Molly said she would try. So she went back, and managed to slip into the giant's house, and crept in below the bed. The giant came home, and ate up a great supper, and went to bed. Molly waited until he was snoring, and she crept out, and reached over the giant and got down the sword; but just as she got it out over the bed it gave a rattle, and up jumped the giant, and Molly ran out at the door and the sword with her; and she ran, and he ran, till they came to the 'Bridge of one hair'; and she got over, but he couldn't and he says, 'Woe worth ye, Molly Whuppie! never ye come again.' And she says: 'Twice yet, carle,' quoth she, 'I'll come to Spain.' So Molly took the sword to the king, and her sister was married to his son. Well, the king he says, 'Ye've managed well, Molly; but if ye would manage better, and steal the purse that lies below the giant's pillow, I would marry your second sister to my second son.' And Molly said she would try. So she set out for the giant's house, and slipped in, and hid again below the bed, and waited till the giant had eaten his supper, and was snoring sound asleep. She slipped out and slipped her hand below the pillow, and got out the purse; but just as she was going out the giant wakened, and ran after her; and she ran, and he ran, till they came to the 'Bridge of one hair,' and she got over, but he couldn't, and he said, 'Woe worth ye, Molly Whuppie! never you come again.' 'Once yet, carle,' quoth she, 'I'll come to Spain.' So Molly took the purse to the king, and her second sister was married to the king's second son. After that the king says to Molly, 'Molly, you are a clever girl, but if you would do better yet, and steal the giant's ring that he wears on his finger, I will give you my youngest son for yourself.' Molly said she would try. So back she goes to the giant's house, and hides herself below the bed. The giant wasn't long ere he came home, and, after he had eaten a great big supper, he went to his bed, and shortly was snoring loud. Molly crept out and reached over the bed, and got hold of the giant's hand, and she pulled and she pulled until she got off the ring; but just as she got it off the giant got up, and gripped her by the hand and he says, 'Now I have caught you, Molly Whuppie; and, if I done as much ill to you as ye have done to me, what would ye do to me?' Molly says, 'I would put you into a sack, and I'd put the cat inside wi' you, and the dog aside you, and a needle and thread and shears, and I'd hang you up upon the wall, and I'd go to the wood, and choose the thickest stick I could get, and I would come home, and take you down, and bang you till you were dead.' 'Well, Molly,' says the giant, 'I'll just do that to you. So he gets a sack, and puts Molly into it, and the cat and the dog beside her, and a needle and thread and shears, and hangs her up upon the wall, and goes to the wood to choose a stick. Molly she sings out, 'Oh, if ye saw what I see.' 'Oh,' says the giant's wife, 'what do you see, Molly?' But Molly never said a word but, 'Oh, if ye saw what I see!' The giants wife begged that Molly would take her up into the sack till she would see what Molly saw. So Molly took the shears and cut a hole in the sack, and took out the needle and thread with her, and jumped down and helped the giants wife up into the sack, and sewed up the hole. The giant's wife saw nothing, and began to ask to get down again; but Molly never minded, but hid herself at the back of the door. Home came the giant, and a great big tree in his hand, and he took down the sack, and began to batter it. His wife cried, 'It's me, man'; but the dog barked and the cat mewed, and he did not know his wife's voice. But Molly came out from the back of the door, and the giant saw her and he ran after her; and he ran, and she ran, till they came to the 'Bridge of one hair,' and she got over, but he couldn't; and he said, 'Woe worth you, Mollie Whuppie! never you come again.' 'Never more, carle,' quoth she, 'will I come again to Spain.' So Molly took the ring to the king, and she was married to his youngest son, and she never saw the giant again. Jacobs' source: W.

{"label": "571B", "text": "There was a wayward priest who had fallen for a smith's wife, and she for him. They feared that the husband might notice something, so the priest came up with a plan to get the smith out of the way. Thus one day the priest went to the nobleman and said, 'In your village there is a very talented smith who can make anything that he wants to. His skill is so great that within one night he could build a palace in your courtyard. However, you will have to threaten him with body and soul, otherwise he will refuse.' The nobleman summoned the smith and said, 'I have heard so much about your skill that I want to put it to the test. Build a palace for me in my courtyard, and it must be finished in one night.' 'Oh God,' said the smith, 'that is not possible. I cannot do that.' 'I am telling you,' cried the nobleman, 'if the palace is not finished by tomorrow morning I shall have you hanged without mercy.' The smith sadly returned home to his wife. 'Wife,' he said, 'I am supposed to build a palace for the nobleman tonight, and if I do not succeed I am to die.' The wife said, 'The only thing that you can do is to go away this very evening.' 'Yes,' he said, 'I'd sooner go away as far as my feet can carry me than to lose my life.' So he tied together a bundle, sadly took leave of his wife, and went on his way, thinking that he would never return. And that is just what his wife and the priest wanted. At nightfall the smith came into a forest where he was met by a gray man who greeted him and asked, 'Where to, my dear smith?' 'Oh,' said the smith, 'I was supposed to build a palace for the nobleman tonight. He commanded me to do this under the threat of death, and because I am unable to do so I am running away as far as my feet can carry me.' 'Just go back home,' said the gray man. 'I shall take care of things for you. The palace will be finished tomorrow morning in due time.' So the smith returned home to his wife. She was just about to fetch the priest when she saw her husband approaching, and she cried out with surprise, 'Oh God, you have come back home. What will happen when the palace is not finished in the morning?' 'Let happen what will happen,' said the smith. 'I cannot stand being away from you and from home for so long.' With that he went to bed and fell asleep. The next morning the nobleman arose very early and looked out his window. He could scarcely believe his eyes, for a magnificent palace was standing there, glistening in the first rays of morning sunshine. When the priest learned what had happened and saw that his plan had failed, he went back to the nobleman and said, 'Now you know how skilled the smith is. This time tell him to bring a himphamp to the palace before tomorrow morning. You have to command him under the threat of body and soul, or he will not do it.' Then the nobleman summoned the smith to appear before him a second time, saying, 'You built the palace entirely to my satisfaction; now you must bring a himphamp to the palace by tomorrow morning. With your skill that should be an easy task for you.' 'My lord,' said the smith, 'how can I bring you a himphamp when I don't even know what one is? I cannot do it.' 'That makes no difference,' said the nobleman. 'If there is no himphamp before my palace tomorrow morning I shall have you hanged without mercy.' Then the smith sadly went back home to his wife. 'Oh God, wife,' he said, 'now the nobleman wants me to get a himphamp by tomorrow morning, and if I cannot do so he will have me hanged without mercy.' The wife said, 'The only thing that you can do is to go away this very evening.' So he tied together a bundle, sadly took leave of his wife, and went on his way, thinking that he would never return. That is just what his unfaithful wife and the priest wanted, and the smith had scarcely left when the priest sneaked into his house to be with the wife. Meanwhile the smith once again came into the woods and was again was met by the gray man, who asked, 'Where to, my dear smith?' 'Oh,' said the smith, 'now that the nobleman has the palace he also wants a himphamp, and because I cannot get one for him I am going as far as my feet can carry me.' 'No one other than the priest has put him up to this,' said the gray man. 'He wants your wife and is trying to get you out of the way. Just go back home. The two of them are there together, and when you see the priest giving your wife a kiss, just say 'Hold fast!' Then take your whip and drive the two of them out of your house along the street to the nobleman's palace. Whenever anyone comes and tries to pull them apart, just say 'Hold fast!' and they will all be stuck together until you say 'Let go!' That will turn into a wonderful himphamp.' The smith thanked the gray man and returned home. It was early morning when he arrived at his village, and he sneaked into his house just as the priest was giving his wife a kiss. 'Hold fast!' cried the smith. Hearing the smith's voice, the priest tried to run away, but -- oh dear! -- it was as if he were glued to the woman. Then the smith took his whip from the wall and drove the two of them out of the house and along the street. They came to the priest's house just as his servant girl with her apron full of hay was about to feed the cow. Seeing her master in a bad situation she quickly ran up and took hold of him in order to get him into his own house, so that no one would see his shame. 'Hold fast!' cried the smith, and the priest's servant girl stuck to the others and had to go along with them. At the same time a herder boy came by, playing his pipe and driving his herd along before him. An old cow wanted to eat the hay that the priest's servant girl was carrying in her apron. 'Hold fast!' cried the smith, and the old cow also stuck to the others and had to go along with them. All this was seen by a baker who had just heated his oven and was about to rake out the coals. He quickly ran up and hit the cow with his long oven-rake. 'Hold fast!' cried the smith, and the baker with his long oven-rake also stuck to the others and had to go along with them. That morning the nobleman got up early; he looked out the window into the courtyard just as the smith came up with his himphamp. When he saw it the nobleman began to laugh, and said, 'You have done well, my dear smith. That is a wonderful himphamp that you have brought to me, but turn them loose now, so they can go back home.' Then the smith said, 'Let go!' and with that they all ran back where they had come from: the priest, the wife, the servant girl, the cow, and the baker with his long oven-rake. However, the priest was so shamed that he never again returned to the smith's house.", "title": "The Smith and the Priest", "id": 338}

The king, going to amuse himself in his garden, saw them, and being told they were beating a snake, said, 'Don't let them beat him. Drive them away.' And this was done. So the naga king got his life, and when he went back to the naga world. He took many jewels, and coming at midnight to the king's bedchamber he gave them to him, saying, 'I got my life through you.' So he made friendship with the king and came again and again to see him. He appointed one of his naga girls, insatiate in pleasures, to be near the king and protect him, and he gave the king a charm, saying, 'If ever you do not see her, repeat this charm.' One day the king went to the garden with the naga girl and was amusing himself in the lotus tank. The naga girl seeing a water snake quitted her human shape and made love with him. The king not seeing the girl said, 'Where is she gone?' and repeated the spell. Then he saw her in her misconduct and struck her with a piece of bamboo. She went in anger to the naga world, and when she was asked, 'Why are you come?' she said, 'Your friend struck me on the back because I did not do his bidding,' showing the mark of the blow. The naga king, not knowing the truth, called four naga youths and sent them with orders to enter Senaka's bedchamber and destroy him like chaff by the breath of their nostrils. They entered the chamber at the royal bedtime. As they came in, the king was saying to the queen, 'Lady, do you know where the naga girl has gone?' 'King, I do not.' 'Today when we were bathing in the tank, she quitted her shape and misconducted herself with a water snake. I said, 'Don't do that,' and struck her with a piece of bamboo to give her a lesson. And now I fear she may have gone to the naga world and told some lie to my friend, destroying his goodwill to me.' The young nagas hearing this turned back at once to the naga world and told their king. He being moved went instantly to the king's chamber, told him all and was forgiven. Then he said, 'In this way I make amends,' and gave the king a charm giving knowledge of all sounds. 'This, O king, is a priceless spell. If you give anyone this spell you will at once enter the fire and die.' The king said, 'It is well,' and accepted it. From that time he understood the voice even of ants. One day he was sitting on the dais eating solid food with honey and molasses, and a drop of honey, a drop of molasses, and a morsel of cake fell on the ground. An ant seeing this comes crying, 'The king's honey jar is broken on the dais, his molasses cart and cake cart are upset. Come and eat honey and molasses and cake.' The king hearing the cry laughed. The queen being near him thought, 'What has the king seen that he laughs?' When the king had eaten his solid food and bathed and sat down cross-legged, a fly said to his wife, 'Come, lady, let us enjoy love.' She said, 'Excuse me for a little, husband. They will soon be bringing perfumes to the king. As he perfumes himself some powder will fall at his feet. I will stay there and become fragrant, then we will enjoy ourselves lying on the king's back.' The king hearing the voice laughed again. The queen thought again, 'What has he seen that he laughs?' Again when the king was eating his supper, a lump of rice fell on the ground. The ants cried, 'A wagon of rice has broken in the king's palace, and there is none to eat it.' The king hearing this laughed again. The queen took a golden spoon and helping him reflected, 'Is it at the sight of me that the king laughs?' She went to the bedchamber with the king and at bedtime she asked, 'Why did you laugh, O king?' He said, 'What have you to do with why I laugh?' But being asked again and again her told her. Then she said, 'Give me your spell of knowledge.' He said, 'It cannot be given.' But though repulsed she pressed him again. The king said, 'If I give you this spell, I shall die.' 'Even though you die, give it me.' The king, being in the power of womankind, saying, 'It is well,' consented and went to the park in a chariot, saying, 'I shall enter the fire after giving away this spell.' At that moment Sakka, king of gods, looked down on the earth and seeing this case said, 'This foolish king, knowing that he will enter the fire through womankind, is on the way; I will give him his life.' So he took Suja, daughter of the Asuras, and went to Benares. He became a he-goat and made her a she-goat, and resolving that the people should not see them, he stood before the king's chariot. The king and the Sindh asses yoked in the chariot saw him, but none else saw him. For the sake of starting talk he was as if making love with the she-goat. One of the Sindh asses yoked in the chariot seeing him said, 'Friend goat, we have heard before, but not seen, that goats are stupid and shameless. But you are doing, with all of us looking on, this thing that should be done in secret and in a private place, and are not ashamed. What we have heard before agrees with this that we see.' And so he spoke the first stanza: The goat hearing him spoke two stanzas: When you're loosed, you don't escape, sir, that's a stupid habit too: And that Senaka you carry, he's more stupid still than you. The king understood the talk of both animals, and hearing it he quickly sent away the chariot. The ass hearing the goat's talk spoke the fourth stanza: The goat explaining this spoke the fifth stanza: The king hearing his words said, 'King of goats, you will surely act for my advantage. Tell me now what is right for me to do.' Then the goat said, 'King, to all animals no one is dearer than self. It is not good to destroy oneself and abandon the honor one has gained for the sake of anything that is dear.' So he spoke the sixth stanza: So the Bodhisatta exhorted the king. The king, delighted, asked, 'King of goats, whence come you?' 'I am Sakka, O king, come to save you from death out of pity for you.' 'King of gods, I promised to give her the charm. What am I to do now?' 'There is no need for the ruin of both of you. You say, 'It is the way of the craft,' and have her beaten with some blows. By this means she will not get it.' The king said, 'It is well,' and agreed. The Bodhisatta after exhortation to the king went to Sakka's heaven. The king went to the garden, had the queen summoned and then said, 'Lady, will you have the charm?' 'Yes, lord.' 'Then go through the usual custom.' 'What custom?' 'A hundred stripes on the back, but you must not make a sound.' She consented through greed for the charm. The king made his slaves take whips and beat her on both sides. She endured two or three stripes and then cried, 'I don't want the charm.' The king said, 'You would have killed me to get the charm,' and so flogging the skin off her back he sent her away. After that she could not bear to talk of it again.", "title": "The Language of Animals (Jataka)", "id": 339}
{"label": "402", "text": "Once upon a time there was a poor peasant who had so many children that he did not have enough of either food or clothing to give them. Pretty children they all were, but the prettiest was the youngest daughter, who was so lovely there was no end to her loveliness. One day -- it was on a Thursday evening late in the fall -- the weather was wild and rough outside, and it was cruelly dark. The rain was falling and the wind blowing, until the walls of the cottage shook. They were all sitting around the fire busy with this thing and that. Then all at once something gave three taps on the window. The father went out to see what was the matter. Outside, what should he see but a great big white bear. 'Good evening to you,' said the white bear. 'The same to you,' said the man. 'Will you give me your youngest daughter? If you will, I'll make you as rich as you are now poor,' said the bear. Well, the man would not be at all sorry to be so rich; but still he thought he must have a bit of a talk with his daughter first; so he went in and told them how there was a great white bear waiting outside, who had given his word to make them so rich if he could only have the youngest daughter. The girl said 'No!' outright. Nothing could get her to say anything else; so the man went out and settled it with the white bear, that he should come again the next Thursday evening and get an answer. Meantime he talked to his daughter, and kept on telling her of all the riches they would get, and how well off she herself would be. At last she agreed to it, so she washed and mended her rags, and made herself as smart as she could. Soon she was ready for the trip, for she didn't have much to take along. The next Thursday evening came the white bear to fetch her. She got on his back with her bundle, and off they went. After they had gone a good way, the white bear said, 'Are you afraid?' No, she wasn't. 'Just hold tight to my shaggy coat, and there's nothing to be afraid of,' said the bear. She rode a long, long way, until they came to a large steep cliff. The white bear knocked on it. A door opened, and they came into a castle, where there were many rooms all lit up; rooms gleaming with silver and gold. Further, there was a table set there, and it was all as grand as grand could be. Then the white bear gave her a silver bell; and when she wanted anything, she only had to ring it, and she would get it at once. Well, after she had eaten, and it became evening, she felt sleepy from her journey, and thought she would like to go to bed, so she rang the bell. She had barely rung it before she found herself in a room, where there was a bed made as fair and white as anyone would wish to sleep in, with silken pillows and curtains, and gold fringe. All that was in the room was gold or silver. After she had gone to bed, and put out the light, a man came and laid himself alongside her. It was the white bear, who cast off his pelt at night; but she never saw him, for he always came after she had put out the light. Before the day dawned he was up and off again. Things went on happily for a while, but at last she became quiet and sad. She was alone all day long, and she became very homesick to see her father and mother and brothers and sisters. So one day, when the white bear asked what was wrong with her, she said it was so lonely there, and how she longed to go home to see her father and mother and brothers and sisters, and that was why she was so sad, because she couldn't get to them. 'Well,' said the bear, 'that can happen all right, but you must promise me, not to talk alone with your mother, but only when the others are around to hear. She will want to take you by the hand and lead you into a room to talk alone with her. But you must not do that, or else you'll bring bad luck on both of us.' So one Sunday the white bear came and said they could now set off to see her father and mother. Off they went, she sitting on his back; and they went far and long. At last they came to a grand house. Her bothers and sisters were outside running about and playing. Everything was so pretty, it was a joy to see. 'This is where your father and mother live now,' said the white bear. 'Now don't forget what I told you, else you'll make us both unhappy.' No, heaven forbid, she'd not forget. When they reached the house, the white bear turned around and left her. She went in to see her father and mother, and there was such joy, that there was no end to it. None of them could thank her enough for all she had done for them. They now had everything they could wish for, as good as good could be. Then they wanted to know how she was. Well, she said, it was very good to live where she did; she had all she wished. I don't know what else she said, but I don't think she told any of them the whole story. That afternoon, after they had eaten dinner, everything happened as the white bear had said it would. Her mother wanted to talk with her alone in her bedroom; but she remembered what the white bear had said, and wouldn't go with her. 'What we have to talk about we can talk about any time,' she said, and put her mother off. But somehow or other, her mother got to her at last, and she had to tell her the whole story. She told her, how every night, after she had gone to bed, a man came and lay down beside her as soon as she had put out the light, and how she never saw him, because he was always up and away before the morning dawned; and how she was terribly sad, for she wanted so much to see him, and how she was by herself all day long, and how dreary, and lonesome it was. 'Oh dear,' said her mother; 'it may well be a troll you are sleeping with! But now I'll give you some good advice how to see him. I'll give you a candle stub, which you can carry home in your bosom; just light it while he is asleep, but be careful not to drop any tallow on him.' Yes, she took the candle, and hid it in her bosom, and that evening the white bear came and took her away. But when they had gone a piece, the white bear asked if all hadn't happened as he had said. She couldn't deny that it had. 'Take care,' said he, 'if you have listened to your mother's advice, you will bring bad luck on us both, and it will be finished with the two of us.' No, by no means! So when she reached home, and had gone to bed, it was the same as before. A man came and lay down beside her; but in the middle of the night, when she heard that he was fast asleep, she got up and lit the candle. She let the light shine on him, and saw that he was the most handsome prince one ever set eyes on. She fell so deeply in love with him, that she thought she couldn't live if she didn't give him a kiss at once. And so she did, but as she kissed him she let three drops of hot tallow drip onto his shirt, and he woke up. 'What have you done?' he cried; 'now you have made us both unlucky, for had you held out only this one year, I would have been free! I have a stepmother who has bewitched me, so that I am a white bear by day, and a man by night. But now all ties are broken between us. Now I must leave you for her. She lives in a castle east of the sun and west of the moon, and there, too, is a princess, one with a nose three yards long, and now I will have to marry her.' She cried and grieved, but there was no help for it; he had to go. Then she asked if she could go with him. No, she could not. 'Tell me the way, then' she said, 'so I can look for you; surely I may do that.' Yes, she could do that, but there was no way leading to the place. It lay east of the sun and west of the moon, and she'd never find her way there. The next morning, when she woke up, both the prince and the castle were gone, and she was lying on a little green patch, in the midst of the thick, dark forest, and by her side lay the same bundle of rags she had brought with her from her old home. When she had rubbed the sleep out of her eyes, and cried until she was tired, she set out on her way, and walked many, many days, until she came to a high cliff. An old woman sat under it, and played with a golden apple which she tossed about. The girl asked her if she knew the way to the prince, who lived with his stepmother in the castle east of the sun and west of the moon, and who was to marry the princess with a nose three yards long. 'How did you come to know about him?' asked the old woman. 'Maybe you are the girl who should have had him?' Yes, she was. 'So, so; it's you, is it?' said the old woman. 'Well, all I know about him is, that he lives in the castle east of the sun and west of the moon, and that you'll get there too late or never; but still you may borrow my horse, and you can ride him to my next neighbor. Maybe she'll be able to tell you; and when you get there just give the horse a switch under the left ear, and beg him to be off home. And you can take this golden apple along with you.' So she got on the horse, and rode a long, long time, until she came to another cliff, under which sat another old woman, with a golden carding comb. The girl asked her if she knew the way to the castle that lay east of the sun and west of the moon, and she answered, like the first old woman, that she knew nothing about it, except that it was east of the sun and west of the moon. 'And you'll get there too late or never; but you can borrow my horse to my next neighbor; maybe she'll tell you all about it; and when you get there, just switch the horse under the left ear, and beg him to be off for home.' This old woman gave her the golden carding comb; she might find some use for it, she said. So the girl got up on the horse, and again rode a long, long way. At last she came to another great cliff, under which sat another old woman, spinning with a golden spinning wheel. She asked her, as well, if she knew the way to the prince, and where the castle was that lay east of the sun and west of the moon. But it was the same thing over again. 'Perhaps you are the one who should have had the prince?' said the old woman. Yes, that she was. But she didn't know the way any better than the other two. She knew it was east of the sun and west of the moon, but that was all. 'And you'll get there too late or never; but I'll lend you my horse, and then I think you'd best ride to the east wind and ask him; maybe he knows his way around those parts, and can blow you there. When you get to him, just give the horse a switch under the left ear, and he'll trot home by himself.' She too gave her her golden spinning wheel. 'Maybe you'll find a use for it,' said the old woman. She rode many weary days, before she got to the east wind's house, but at last she did reach it, and she asked the east wind if he could tell her the way to the prince who lived east of the sun and west of the moon. Yes, the east wind had often heard tell of it, the prince and the castle, but he didn't know the way there, for he had never blown so far. 'But, if you want, I'll go with you to my brother the west wind. Maybe he knows, for he's much stronger. If you will just get on my back I'll carry you there.' Yes, she got on his back, and off they went in a rush. When they arrived at the west wind's house, the east wind said the girl he had brought was the one who was supposed to have had the prince who lived in the castle east of the sun and west of the moon. She had set out to find him, and he had brought her here, and would be glad to know if the west wind knew how to get to the castle. 'No,' said the west wind, 'I've never blown so far; but if you want, I'll go with you to our brother the south wind, for he's much stronger than either of us, and he has flown far and wide. Maybe he'll tell you. Get on my back, and I'll carry you to him.' Yes, she got on his back, and so they traveled to the south wind, and I think it didn't take long at all. When they got there, the west wind asked him if he could tell her the way to the castle that lay east of the sun and west of the moon, for she was the one who was supposed to have had the prince who lived there. 'Is that so?' said the south wind. 'Is she the one? Well, I have visited a lot of places in my time, but I have not yet blown there. If you want, I'll take you to my brother the north wind; he is the oldest and strongest of us all, and if he doesn't know where it is, you'll never find anyone in the world to tell you. Get on my back, and I'll carry you there.' Yes, she got on his back, and away he left his house at a good clip. They were not long underway. When they reached the north wind's house he was so wild and cross, that he blew cold gusts at them from a long way off. 'Blast you both, what do you want?' he roared at them from afar, so that it struck them with an icy shiver. 'Well,' said the south wind, 'you don't need to bluster so, for here I am, your brother, the south wind, and here is the girl who was supposed to have had the prince who lives in the castle that lies east of the sun and west of the moon, and now she wants to ask you if you ever were there, and can show her the way, for she wants so much to find him again.' 'Yes, I know where it is,' said the north wind; 'a single time I blew an aspen leaf there, but afterward I was so tired that I couldn't blow a puff for many days. But if you really wish to go there, and aren't afraid to come along with me, I'll take you on my back and see if I can blow you there.' Yes, with all her heart; she wanted to and had to get there if it were at all possible; and she wouldn't be afraid, however madly he went. 'Very well, then,' said the north wind, 'but you must sleep here tonight, for we must have the whole day before us, if we're to get there at all.' Early next morning the north wind woke her, and puffed himself up, and blew himself out, and made himself so stout and big. that he was gruesome to look at. Off they went high up through the air, as if they would not stop until they reached the end of the world. Here on earth there was a terrible storm; acres of forest and many houses were blown down, and when it swept over the sea, ships wrecked by the hundred. They tore on and on -- no one can believe how far they went -- and all the while they still went over the sea, and the north wind got more and more weary, and so out of breath he could barely bring out a puff, and his wings drooped and drooped, until at last he sunk so low that the tops of the waves splashed over his heels. 'Are you afraid?' said the north wind. No, she wasn't. They weren't very far from land by now, and the north wind had enough strength left that he managed to throw her up on the shore under the windows of the castle which lay east of the sun and west of the moon. But then he was so weak and worn out, that he had to stay there and rest many days before he could go home again. The next morning the girl sat down under the castle window, and began to play with the golden apple. The first person she saw was the long-nosed princess who was to have the prince. 'What do you want for your golden apple, you girl?' said the long-nosed one, as she opened the window. 'It's not for sale, for gold or money,' said the girl. 'If it's not for sale for gold or money, what is it that you will sell it for? You may name your own price,' said the princess. 'Well, you can have it, if I may get to the prince, who lives here, and be with him tonight,' said the girl whom the north wind had brought. Yes, that could be done. So the princess took the golden apple; but when the girl came up to the prince's bedroom that night, he was fast asleep. She called him and shook him, and cried and grieved, but she could not wake him up. The next morning. as soon as day broke, the princess with the long nose came and drove her out. That day she sat down under the castle windows and began to card with her golden carding comb, and the same thing happened. The princess asked what she wanted for it. She said it wasn't for sale for gold or money, but if she could have permission to go to the prince and be with him that night, the princess could have it. But when she went to his room she found him fast asleep again, and however much she called, and shook, and cried, and prayed, she couldn't get life into him. As soon as the first gray peep of day came, the princess with the long nose came, and chased her out again. That day the girl sat down outside under the castle window and began to spin with her golden spinning wheel, and the princess with the long nose wanted to have it as well. She opened the window and asked what she wanted for it. The girl said, as she had said twice before, that it wasn't for sale for gold or money, but if she could go to the prince who was there, and be alone with him that night she could have it. Yes, she would be welcome to do that. But now you must know that there were some Christians who had been taken there, and while they were sitting in their room, which was next to the prince's, they had heard how a woman had been in there, crying, praying, and calling to him for two nights in a row, and they told this to the prince. That evening, when the princess came with a sleeping potion, the prince pretended to drink it, but threw it over his shoulder, for he could guess it was a sleeping potion. So, when the girl came in, she found the prince wide awake, and then she told him the whole story of how she had come there. 'Ah,' said the prince, 'you've come in the very nick of time, for tomorrow is to be our wedding day. But now I won't have the long-nose, and you are the only woman in the world who can set me free. I'll say that I want to see what my wife is fit for, and beg her to wash the shirt which has the three spots of tallow on it. She'll agree, for she doesn't know that you are the one who put them there. Only Christians, and not such a pack of trolls, can wash them out again. I'll say that I will marry only the woman who can wash them out, and ask you to try it.' So there was great joy and love between them all the night. But next day, when the wedding was planned, the prince said, 'First of all, I'd like to see what my bride is fit for.' 'Yes!' said the stepmother, with all her heart. 'Well,' said the prince, 'I've got a fine shirt which I'd like for my wedding shirt, but somehow or other it got three spots of tallow on it, which I must have washed out. I have sworn to marry only the woman who is able to do that. If she can't, then she's not worth having.' Well, that was no big thing they said, so they agreed, and the one with the long nose began to wash away as hard as she could, but the more she rubbed and scrubbed, the bigger the spots grew. 'Ah!' said the old troll woman, her mother, 'you can't wash. Let me try.' But she had hardly touched the shirt, before it got far worse than before, and with all her rubbing, and wringing, and scrubbing, the spots grew bigger and blacker, and the shirt got ever darker and uglier. Then all the other trolls began to wash, but the longer it lasted, the blacker and uglier the shirt grew, until at last it was as black all over as if it been up the chimney. 'Ah!' said the prince, 'none of you is worth a straw; you can't wash. Why there, outside, sits a beggar girl, I'll bet she knows how to wash better than the whole lot of you. Come in, girl!' he shouted. She came in. 'Can you wash this shirt clean, girl, you?' he said. 'I don't know,' she said, 'but I think I can.' And almost before she had taken it and dipped it into the water, it was as white as driven snow, and whiter still. 'Yes, you are the girl for me,' said the prince. At that the old troll woman flew into such a rage, she exploded on the spot, and the princess with the long nose after her, and the whole pack of trolls after her -- at least I've never heard a word about them since. As for the prince and princess, they set free all the poor Christians who had been captured and shut up there; and they took with them all the silver and gold, and flew away as far as they could from the castle that lay east of the sun and west of the moon.

{"label": "706", "text": "Once upon a time there was a woman who had an inn where she provided shelter to travelers. She had a daughter who was so beautiful that one could not imagine anyone more beautiful. The mother could not stand her, precisely because she was so beautiful, and always kept her locked up in a room so no one could see her. The only person who knew about her was the maid who brought food to her every day. One day it happened that the king wanted to spend the night at the inn. He arrived just as the maid was bringing food to the girl. Someone called the maid, and she forgot to close the door behind her. Noticing this, the innkeeper's daughter became curious and wanted to see the king. She stepped into the doorway, but when the king walked down the hall she quickly stepped back into the room. However, he saw her, and was completely blinded with her beauty. 'Where is the beautiful girl whom I saw in the hallway?' he asked the maid who was serving him. 'Oh, your majesty,' she answered, 'that is the innkeeper's daughter, and she is just as good as she is beautiful. But her mother keeps he locked up so that no one can see her.' The king was so enchanted with her beauty that he wanted to marry her. Because he could not ask the mother for her hand, he called for the maid and said, 'I shall remain here for a few days. Go to the daughter and ask her if she will be my wife.' The maid went to the girl and said, 'Just think, miss, the king wants to marry you, and he wants to know if you will flee with him and escape from this house where you are treated so badly.' 'Oh,' answered the poor girl, 'how would I be able to flee? My mother keeps such a strict watch over me.' 'Just leave it to me,' answered the faithful maid. She then went to the king and said, 'I know what you can do. Leave here tomorrow, as though you were returning to your home. Stop somewhere nearby. The girl will pretend to be sick, and I'll tell her mother that it is because she is always locked indoors. If she will let her go outside then I'll bring her to you. Take me with you, because I'll not be able to return without the girl.' The king promised to do this, and the next day the king pretended to leave. However, he went only a short distance, then stopped at another inn, but without letting it be known that he was the king. The innkeeper's daughter pretended to be sick and refused to eat anything, losing more and more weight. 'Just what does the girl have that makes her so ill?' asked the mother. 'Of course the poor child is sick,' answered the maid. She is always kept inside never gets any fresh air. Tomorrow let her go to the fair with me. Those few steps will bring her back to health.' The mother agreed to this, and the next morning the maid and the daughter left for the fair. They were scarcely out of the mother's view when they rushed to the king, whose carriage was ready to go. He lifted the beautiful girl inside, and they rode away. He gave the faithful maid so much money that she was able to move to a different country with her entire family. The king arrived at his castle and introduced his fianc\u00c3\u00a9e to his mother. 'This is my dear fianc\u00c3\u00a9e,' he said, 'and now we want to have a splendid wedding.' The girl was so beautiful that the old queen accepted her immediately. There was a splendid wedding, and the king and his young wife lived together happily and contentedly. Nearly a year had passed when war broke out, and the king had to go off to battle. He said to the old queen, 'Mother, dear, I must go away. I entrust my dear wife to you. If she should have a baby, let me know immediately, and take good care of it.' With that he embraced his mother and his wife, and departed. Not long afterward the young queen gave birth to her first son, and the old queen took good care of her. She immediately wrote a letter to the king telling him of the birth of his son. The messenger carrying the letter to the king stopped to rest at the inn owned by the young queen's mother. Upon arriving there he ordered something to eat, and while he was eating, the innkeeper asked him where he was from and where he was going. He explained how he had been sent to report to the king the happy birth of his son. Hearing this, the innkeeper resolved to take revenge against her daughter for having escaped. The messenger lay down and fell asleep, whereupon the innkeeper took the letter from his pocket and replaced it with a different one, claiming that the young queen had been guilty of the worst infidelity and deserved the strictest punishment. This was the letter that the messenger brought to the king. This letter saddened the king greatly because he was so in love with his wife. Nonetheless, he wrote to the old queen that she should take good care of his wife and do nothing until he had returned. The messenger departed with this letter. Arriving at the inn, he once again ordered something to eat. The innkeeper asked if the king had sent a response with him. 'Yes,' he answered, 'the letter is in my pocket.' The messenger once again fell asleep after eating, and the innkeeper replaced the king's letter with a different one, wherein it was written that the young queen's hands should be chopped off, the child should be tied to her maimed arms, and that the two of them should be thus exiled into the wide world. After receiving this letter the old queen cried bitterly, for she dearly loved her daughter-in-law. However, the young queen meekly said, 'I shall do whatever my lord and husband commands!' With that she had her own hands chopped off. The child was then tied to her arms so that she could nurse it. She then embraced the old queen and wandered away, far away into a dark forest. After wandering a great while she came to a little brook. Because she was very tired she sat down. 'Oh,' she thought, 'if only I had my hands I would not be so helpless. Then I could wash out my child's diaper and dress him with clean clothes. As it is, my innocent child shall soon die.' As she thus spoke and wept, an old and distinguished man suddenly appeared before her and asked why she was crying. She told him of her sorrow and how she innocently had been inflicted with such severe punishment. 'Don't cry,' said the old man. 'Come with me, and all will go well with you.' He led her a little further into the woods, then he struck the ground with his staff, and suddenly a castle appeared, much grander than the king's castle. A garden was there as well, and the king himself did not have a better one. The old man was Saint Joseph, and he had come to the aid of the innocent young queen. The young queen and her child lived with Saint Joseph in the beautiful castle, and because she was so good, Saint Joseph caused her hands to grow back. The child grew large and strong, and every day became more beautiful. But now we shall leave the queen and see what is happening with the king. The war ended, and the king sorrowfully returned to his castle. His wife's infidelity broke his heart. 'What have you done with my wife?' he asked his mother. 'Oh, you wicked man,' answered the queen, weeping, 'how could you cause your innocent wife to suffer so greatly?' 'What!' he cried. 'Did you not write to me that she was guilty of great infidelity.' 'You say that I wrote that to you?' said the queen. 'I reported the happy birth of your son, and you replied that I should have her hands chopped off and exiled into the wide world with her child.' 'I wrote no such thing!' cried the king. Then the two of them brought forth the letters, and said that they had not written them. 'Oh, my dear innocent child!' sobbed the old queen. 'Now you are surely dead!' Great sadness fell over the castle, and the king was so miserable that he turned seriously ill. He finally recovered but remained wretchedly unhappy. One day the old queen said to him, 'My son, the weather is beautiful, why don't you go hunting? Perhaps it will distract you.' So the king mounted his horse and sadly rode into the woods, but without hunting. Because of his grief he did not pay attention to where he was going, and soon found himself lost in the dense forest. His attendants did not dare to say anything to him. As it was growing dark the king wanted to turn back, but no one knew the right way, so they blundered ever deeper into the woods. Finally they saw a light in the distance, and following it they came to the beautiful castle where the young queen was living. They knocked, and Saint Joseph opened the door and asked what they wanted. 'Oh, my good old man,' answered the king. 'Could you give us shelter for the night? We are lost and cannot find our way back home.' Saint Joseph invited them in, fed them, and offered them good beds. However, the young queen and her son did not show themselves. The next morning, while the king was at breakfast, Saint Joseph went to the young queen and said, 'The king has spent the night here. Now is the moment when your sorrows shall cease.' The queen dressed her son in his best clothes, and Saint Joseph had him go to the king, kiss his hand, and say, 'Good morning, papa, I would like to eat breakfast with you.' Seeing the beautiful child, the king was very moved, but did not know why. Then the door opened and the young queen entered with Saint Joseph. She bowed before the king. He recognized his beloved wife and embraced her and his little son. Saint Joseph approached them, saying, 'All your sorrows are now at an end. Live happily and contentedly, and if ever you have a wish, just call on me, for I am Saint Joseph.' With that he blessed them and disappeared. The castle disappeared at the same time, leaving the king, the queen, their son and the attendants all standing in the woods. Before them they saw the pathway that led out of the woods and back to their castle. They came to the old queen who was happy from the bottom of her heart to see once again her beloved daughter-in-law and her little grandson. Then all together they lived happily and contentedly, but we, we went away with nothing.", "title": "The Innkeeper's Beautiful Daughter", "id": 341}
{"label": "441", "text": "Once upon a time the boys and girls of a village used to watch the crops of but [a kind of grain] growing by a river, and there was a Hanuman monkey who wished to eat the but, but they drove him away. So he made a plan. He used to make a garland of flowers and go with it to the field, and, when he was driven away, he would leave the flowers behind. And the children were pleased with the flowers and ended by making friends with the monkey and did not drive him away. There was one of the young girls who was fascinated by the monkey and promised to marry him. Some of the other children told this in the village, and the girl's father and mother came to hear of it and were angry, and the father took some of the villagers and went and shot the monkey. Then they decided not to throw away the body, but to burn it like the corpse of a man. So they made a pyre and put the body on it and set fire to it. Just then the girl came, and they told her to go away, but she said that she wished to see whether they really burned him like a man. So she stood by, and when the pyre was in full blaze, she called out, 'Oh look what is happening to the stars in the sky!' At this everyone looked up at the sky. Then she took some sand which she had in the fold of her cloth and threw it into the air, and it fell into their eyes and blinded them. While they were rubbing the sand out of their eyes the girl leapt onto the pyre, and was burned along with the monkey and died a sati [also spelled suttee -- a Hindu widow's suicidal cremation on her husband's funeral pyre as a demonstration of devotion]. Her father and brothers were very angry at this and said that the girl must have had a monkey's soul, and so she was fascinated by him.

{"label": "402", "text": "A man and a woman had no children, although they would have given their lives to have some. They prayed for offspring, under any conditions. It appeared that heaven had mercy on them, but when the time came, the newborn was a female frog. Not letting themselves be distracted, the man and the woman raised her. They taught her music and all kinds of skills. Above all else the frog loved to sing, and she trained her voice and her range until one would think she was the best singer from the city. Other people had not seen the frog and thought indeed that she was an unknown singer and could not explain why she did not perform in public. One day the king's son passed by the house and heard the frog singing. He stopped and listened for a long time. He immediately fell in love with the unknown singer and approached her father with a request for permission to see her and speak with her, but the father refused. The prince heard her sing again and fell even more deeply in love with her. He demanded that her father give her to him in marriage. The father replied that he would have to ask his daughter. The frog agreed under the conditions that she be taken to the royal castle in an enclosed carriage and that she be allowed to enter the bridal chamber without being seen. The prince, his curiosity even more aroused, accepted the conditions. On the appointed day the frog rode to the royal castle in a tightly enclosed carriage and made her way to the splendid bridal chamber without being seen. She hid herself in one of the two beds that were there. The prince came that evening and was astonished when he could not find his bride. Disappointed, he went to bed. At midnight the frog crept out of the cushions and onto the prince's breast. Half asleep, he took the frog into his hand and threw her to the floor. She hopped angrily down the steps and home. The next morning the prince was sorry that he had thrown the frog to the floor, and he became sad and melancholy. Some time later he went back to the house. Hearing singing, he fell madly in love and began courting his bride anew. The frog accepted, this time without setting any conditions. She made a little carriage out of cardboard, hitched a rooster to it, and drove it herself to the royal castle. Three fairies were standing in the road. One of them had swallowed a fishbone, which stuck in her throat and was causing her great pain. When the three of them saw the frog driving by in her little carriage and cracking her whip so merrily, they all laughed out with joy. The fishbone dislodged itself from the one fairy's throat, freeing her suddenly of her pain. They approached the frog, and the first one said, 'I will give you a beautiful carriage with horses and servants!' And in an instant a carriage was there with horses and servants in beautiful livery. Then the second one said, 'I will give you expensive clothes and gold and silver!' And in an instant it was all there, gleaming and shimmering, and it was such a joy. Then came the third fairy, the one who had been freed of the fishbone by laughing, and she said, 'I will transform you!' In that instant the frog became a beautiful maiden. She graciously thanked the three kind fairies and drove happily to the royal castle and to her jubilant and joyful wedding.

{"label": "510B", "text": "Note by D. L. Ashliman: The conflict between father and daughter in most folktales of type 510B derives from the mother's death and the father's subsequent attempts to marry his own daughter, as evidenced in the previous tales at this site. In some versions, however, the incest motif is suppressed, and the conflict between father and daughter is given a different motivation. The following tale, told here in verse, illustrates this minority group. The heroine here is not at risk because of her father's incestuous desires, but for an inclination much less governed by taboo: his displeasure over the birth of a female child. Note also that the abusive relationship between the heroine and the man she will ulitmately marry has also been altered in this version. She receives the same blows, but from the hands of her female employer, not her future husband. And now, an English version of Catskin: His lady's again in the way, So she said to her husband with joy, 'I hope some or other fine day, To present you, my dear, with a boy.' The gentleman answered gruff, 'If't should turn out a maid or a mouse, For of both we have more than enough, She shan't stay to live in my house.' The lady, at this declaration, Almost fainted away with pain; But what was her sad consternation, When a sweet little girl came again. She sent her away to be nurs'd, Without seeing her gruff papa; And when she was old enough, To a school she was packed away. Fifteen summers are fled, Now she left good Mrs. Jervis; To see home she was forbid, She determined to go and seek service. Her dresses so grand and so gay, She carefully rolled in a knob; Which she hid in a forest away, And put on a catskin robe. She knock'd at a castle gate, And pray'd for charity; They sent her some meat on a plate, And kept her a scullion to be. My lady look'd long in her face, And prais'd her great beauty; I'm sorry I've no better place, And you must our scullion be. So Catskin was under the cook, A very sad life she led, For often a ladle she took, And broke poor Catskin's head. There is now a grand ball to be, When ladies their beauties show; 'Mrs. Cook,' said Catskin, 'dear me, How much I should like to go!' 'You go with your catskin robe, You dirty impudent slut! Among the fine ladies and lords, A very fine figure you'd cut.' A basin of water she took, And dash'd in poor Catskin's face; But briskly her ears she shook, And went in her hiding place. She washed every stain from her skin, In some crystal waterfall; Then put on a beautiful dress, And hasted away to the ball. When she entered, the ladies were mute, Overcome by her figure and face; But the lord, her young master, at once Fell in love with her beauty and grace; He pray'd her his partner to be, She said, 'Yes!' with a sweet smiling glance; All night with no other lady But Catskin, our young lord would dance. 'Pray tell me, fair maid, where you live?' For now was the sad parting time; But she no other answer would give, Than this distich of mystical rhyme, -- Kind sir, if the truth I must tell, At the sign of the Basin of Water I dwell. Then she flew from the ballroom, and put On her catskin robe again; And slipt in unseen by the cook, Who little thought where she had been. The young lord, the very next day, To his mother his passion betrayed; He declared he never would rest, Till he'd found out this beautiful maid. There's another grand ball to be, Where ladies their beauties show; 'Mrs. Cook,' said Catskin, 'dear me, How much I should like to go!' 'You go with your catskin robe, You dirty impudent slut! Among the fine ladies and lords, A very fine figure you'd cut.' In a rage the ladle she took, And broke poor Catkin's head; But off she went shaking her ears, And swift to her forest she fled. She washed every blood stain off In some crystal waterfall; Put on a more beautiful dress, And hasted away to the ball. My lord, at the ballroom door, Was waiting with pleasure and pain; He longed to see nothing so much As the beautiful Catskin again. When he asked her to dance, she again Said 'Yes!' with her first smiling glance; And again, all the night, my young Lord With none but fair Catskin did dance. 'Pray tell me,' said he, 'where you live?' For now 'twas the parting time; But she no other answer would give, Than this distich of mystical rhyme, -- Kind sir, if the truth I must tell, At the sign of the Broken Ladle I dwell. Then she flew from the ball, and put on Her catskin robe again; And slipt in unseen by the cook, Who little thought where she had been. My lord did again, the next day, Declare to his mother his mind, That he never more happy should be, Unless he his charmer should find. Now another grand ball is to be, Where ladies their beauties show; 'Mrs. Cook', said Catskin, 'dear me, How much I should like to go!' 'You go with your catskin robe, You impudent, dirty slut! Among the find ladies and lords, A very fine figure you'd cut.' In a fury she took the skimmer, And broke poor Catskin's head; But heart-whole and lively as ever, Away to her forest she fled. She washed the stains of blood In some crystal waterfall; Then put on her most beautiful dress, And hasted away to the ball. My lord, at the ballroom door, Was waiting with pleasure and pain; He longed to see nothing so much As the beautiful Catskin again. When he asked her to dance, she again Said 'Yes!' with her first smiling glance; And all the night long, my young Lord With none but fair Catskin would dance. 'Pray tell me, fair maid, where you live?' For now was the parting time; But she no other answer would give, Than this distich of mystical rhyme, -- Kind sir, if the truth I must tell, At the sign of the Broken Skimmer I dwell. Then she flew from the hall, and threw on Her catskin cloak again; And slipt in unseen by the cook, Who little thought where she had been. But not by my lord unseen, For this time he followed too fast; And, hid in the forest green, Saw the strange things that past. Next day he took to his bed, And sent for the doctor to come; And begg'd him no other than Catskin, Might come into his room. He told him how dearly he lov'd her, Not to have her his heart would break; Then the doctor kindly promised To the proud old lady to speak. There's a struggle of pride and love, For she fear'd her son would die; But pride at the last did yield, And love had the mastery. Then my lord got quickly well, When he was his charmer to wed; And Catskin, before a twelvemonth, Of a young lord was brought to bed. To a wayfaring woman and child, Lady Catskin one day sent an alms; The nurse did the errand, and carried The sweet little lord in her arms. The child gave the alms to the child, This was seen by the old lady mother; 'Only see,' said that wicked old woman, 'How the beggars' brats take to each other!' This throw went to Catskin's heart, She flung herself down on her knees, And pray'd her young master and lord To seek out her parents would please. They sent out in my lord's own coach; They traveled, but naught befell Till they reach'd the town hard by Where Catskin's father did dwell. They put up at the head inn, Where Catskin was left alone; But my lord went to try if her father His natural child would own. When folks are away, in short time What great alterations appear; For the cold touch of death had all chill'd The hearts of her sisters dear. Her father repented too late, And the loss of his youngest bemoan'd; In his old and childless state, He his pride and cruelty own'd. The old gentleman sat by the fire, And hardly looked up at my lord; He had no hope of comfort A stranger could afford. But my lord drew a chair close by, And said, in a feeling tone, 'Have you not, sir, a daughter, I pray, You never would see or own?' The old man alarm'd, cried aloud, 'A hardened sinner am I! I would give all my worldly goods, To see her before I die.' Then my lord brought his wife and child To their home and parent's face, Who fell down and thanks returned To God, for his mercy and grace. The bells, ringing up in the tower, Are sending a sound to the heart; There's a charm in the old church bells, Which nothing in life can impart!", "title": "The Story of Catskin (Halliwell)", "id": 344}
{"label": "592", "text": "A dirty, ragged old man was sitting there. He called to him, 'Give me something, for God's sake!' 'I only have three hellers, but I'll give them to you. In three years I'll earn them again. Just take them.' 'I thank you very much, and I shall grant you three wishes. What do you choose.' 'I ask for a gun that never misses its target, for a violin that makes everyone dance, and further I wish that no one will be able refuse my requests.' The old man made the wishes come true, and Johann continued on his way, half dancing, half walking. He came to a forest and stayed there to rest. Suddenly he heard someone say, 'Oh, I'd gladly give anything if I could have the beautiful nightingale singing over there on that tree.' It was the farmer who had given Johann three hellers as wages who uttered these words. Johann took his gun, which never missed its target, and shot down the nightingale, which fell into a thicket of thorns. The miser crept into the thorny thicket. Johann took up his violin and played, and the miser, driven by a higher power, began to hop and leap, and the thorns pricked him miserably. 'Hold on, hold on,' he yelled to the boy, 'I'll give you five hundred thalers. Just let me go.' Johann stopped playing, the farmer paid him the thalers, but went away grumbling and then brought charges against him at the court. Johann was arrested and sentenced to death. The execution was to take place the next day. The farmer, the judges, and all the local people were gathered at the place of execution, where a high gallows was set up. Johann was brought in but asked the judges for his violin so that he could play once more before he died. The farmer yelled, 'Don't give it to him! Tie me up!' But since Johann could not be denied anything, the violin was brought to him. He started to play, and everyone had to dance. The judges, tired and exhausted, asked Johann to stop playing and promised him that they would set him free. He agreed to this and was now able to return to his village with his gun and his violin, which he still used on various occasions. (Somme)", "title": "The Magic Violin", "id": 345}

{"label": "1540", "text": "'Yes,' said the man who had a daughter to marry; 'you'll do very well; you're just about the sort of son-in- law I want.' And then he added: 'If our daughter is to be betrothed today, it is the occasion for a feast.' So to the wife he said, 'Prepare the table; 'and to the daughter he said, 'Draw the wine.' The daughter went down into the cellar to draw the wine. But as she drew the wine she began to cry, saying: 'If I am to be married I shall have a child, and the child will be a son, and the son will be a priest, and the priest will be a bishop, and the bishop will be a cardinal, and the cardinal will be a pope.' And she cried and cried, and the wine was running all the time, so that the bottle she was filling ran over, and went on running over. Then said the father and mother: 'What can the girl be doing down in the cellar so long?' But the mother said: 'I must go and see.' So the mother went down to see why she was so long, but the moment she came into the cellar she, too, began to cry; so that the wine still went on running over. Then the father said: 'What can the girl and her mother both be doing so long down in the cellar? I must go and see.' So the father went down into the cellar; but the moment he got into the cellar he, too, began to cry, and could do nothing for crying; so the wine still went on running over. Then he who had come to seek a wife said: 'What can these people all be doing so long down in the cellar?' So he, too, went down to see, and found them all crying in the cellar and the wine running over. Only when the wine was all run out they left off crying and came upstairs again. Then the betrothal and the marriage were happily celebrated. One day after they were married the husband went into the market to buy meat, and he bought a large provision because he had invited a friend to dinner. When the wife saw him buy such a quantity of meat she began to cry, saying: 'What can we do with such a lot of meat?' 'Oh, never mind, don't make a misery of it,' said the husband; 'put it behind you [never mind it].' The simple wife took the meat and went home, saying to her parents, and crying the while: 'My husband says I am to put all this meat behind me! Do tell me what can I do?' 'You can't put the whole lot of it behind you, that's certain,' replied the equally simple mother; 'but we can manage it between us.' Then she took the meat and put all the hard, bony part on one chair, where she made the father sit down on it; all the fat, skinny part she put on another chair, and made the wife sit down on it; and the fleshy, meaty part she put on another chair, and sat down on that herself. Presently the husband came with his friend, ready for dinner, knocking at the door. None of the three dared to move, however, that they might not cease to be fulfilling his injunctions. Then he looked through the keyhole, and, seeing them all sitting down without moving when he knocked, he thought they must all be dead; so he ran and fetched a locksmith, who opened the door for him. 'What on earth are you all doing there,'exclaimed the hungry husband, 'instead of getting dinner ready?' 'You told me to put the meat behind me, and I have done so,' answered the simple wife. Then he saw they were sitting on the meat. Out of all patience with such idiocy, he exclaimed: 'This is the last you'll ever see of me. At least I promise you not to come back till I have met three other people as idiotic as you, and that's hardly likely to occur.' With that he took his friend to a tavern to dine, and then put on a pilgrim's dress and went wandering over the country. In the first city he came to there was great public rejoicing going on. The princess had just been married, and the court was keeping high festival. As he came up to the palace the bride and bridegroom were just come back from church. The bride wore one of those very high round headdresses that they used to wear in olden time, with a long veil hanging from it. It was so very high that she could not by any means get in at the door, and there she stuck, not knowing what to do. Then she began to cry, saying: 'What shall I do? what shall I do?' 'Shall I tell you what to do?'said the pilgrim-husband, drawing near. 'Oh, pray do, if you can; I will give you a hundred scudi if you will only show me how to get in.' So he went and made her go a few steps backward, and then bow her head very low, and so she could pass under the door. 'Really, I have found one woman as simple as my people at home,' said the pilgrim-husband, as he sat down to the banquet at the special invitation of the princess, in reward for his services. Afterwards she counted out a hundred scudi to him, and he went further. Further along the road he came to a farm, with barns and cattle and plenty of stock about, and a large well at which a woman was drawing water. Instead of dipping in the pail, she had got the well-rope knotted into a huge knot, which she kept dipping into the water and squeezing out into the pail, and she kept crying as she did so: 'Oh, how long shall I be filling the pail! The pail will never be full!' 'Shall I show you how to fill it?'asked the pilgrim-husband, drawing near. 'Oh, yes, do show me if you can. I will give you a hundred scudi if you will only show me.' Then he took all the knots out of the rope and let down the pail by it, and filled it in a minute. 'Here's a second woman as stupid as my people at home,' said the pilgrim-husband, as the farmer's wife asked him in to dinner in reward for his great services. 'If I go on at this rate I shall have to return to her at last, in spite of my protestations.' After that the farmer's wife counted out the hundred scudi of the promised reward, and he went on further, having first packed six eggs into his hollow staff as provision for the journey. Towards nightfall he arrived at a lone cottage. Here he knocked and asked a bed for his night's lodging. 'I can't give you that,' said a voice from the inside; 'for I am a lone widow. I can't take a man in to sleep here.' 'But I am a pilgrim,' replied he; 'let me in at least to cook a bit of supper.' 'That I don't mind doing,' said the good wife, and she opened the door. 'Thanks, good friend!' said the pilgrim-husband as he sat down by the stove; 'now add to your charity a couple of eggs in a pan.' So she gave him a pan and two eggs, and a bit of butter to cook them in; but he took the six eggs out of his staff and broke them into the pan, too. Presently, when the good wife turned her head his way again, and saw eight eggs swimming in the pan instead of two, she said: 'Lack-a-day! You must surely be some strange being from the other world. Do you know so-and-so there?' (naming her dead husband). 'Oh, yes,' said the pilgrim-husband, enjoying the joke. 'I know him very well. He lives just next to me.' 'Only to think of that!' replied the poor woman. 'And do tell me, how do you get on in the other world? What sort of a life is it?' 'Oh, not so very bad. It depends what sort of a place you get. The part where we are is not very bad, except that we get very little to eat. Your husband, for instance, is nearly starved.' 'No, really! 'cried the good wife, clasping her hands. 'Only fancy! My good husband starving out there! So fond as he was of a good dinner, too!' Then she added, coaxingly: 'As you know him so well, perhaps you wouldn't mind doing him the charity of taking him a little somewhat to give him a treat. There are such lots of things I could easily send him.' 'O, dear no, not at all. I'll do it with great pleasure,'answered he. 'But I'm not going back till tomorrow; and if I don't sleep here I must go on further, and then I shan't come by this way.' 'That's true,'replied the widow. 'Ah, well, I mustn't mind what the folks say, for such an opportunity as this may never occur again. You must sleep in my bed, and I must sleep on the hearth; and in the morning I'll load a donkey with provisions for my poor dear husband.' 'Oh, no,'replied the pilgrim. 'You shan't be disturbed in your bed; only let me sleep on the hearth, that will do for me; and as I'm an early riser I can be gone before anyone's astir, so folks won't have anything to say.' So it was done, and an hour before sunrise the woman was up loading the donkey with the best of her stores. There were ham, and maccaroni, and flour, and cheese, and wine. All this she committed to the pilgrim, saying: 'You'll send the donkey back, won't you?' 'Of course I would send him back, He'd be no use to us out there: but I shan't get out again myself for another hundred years or so, and I fear he won't find his way back alone, for it's no easy way to find.' 'To be sure not; I ought to have thought of that,' replied the widow. 'Ah, well, so as my poor husband gets a good meal never mind the donkey.' So the pretended pilgrim from the other world went his way. He hadn't gone a hundred yards before the widow called him back. 'Ah, she's beginning to think better of it!' said he to himself; and he continued his way, pretending not to hear. 'Good pilgrim!' shouted the widow; 'I forgot one thing. Would any money be of use to my poor dear husband?' 'Oh dear yes, all the use in the world,' replied the pilgrim; 'you can always get anything for money everywhere.' 'Oh, do come back then, and I'll trouble you with a hundred scudi for him.' The pretended pilgrim came back willingly for the hundred scudi, and the widow counted them out to him. 'There is no help for it,' soliloquised he as he went his way; 'I must go back to those at home. I have actually found three women each more stupid than they.' So he went home to live, and complained no more of the simplicity of his wife.", "title": "The Simple Wife", "id": 347}
{"label": "440", "text": "The daughter went, and she reached the well. A losgann (frog or toad) came up to ask her if she would wed him, if she should get a drink for her mother. 'I will not wed thee, hideous creature! on any account,' said she. 'Well then,' said he, 'thou shalt not get the water.' She went away home, and her mother sent away her sister that was nearest to her, to seek a drink of the water. She reached the well, and the toad came up and asked her if she would marry him if she should get the water. 'I won't marry thee, hideous creature!' said she. 'Thou shalt not get the water then,' said he. She went home, and her sister that was youngest went to seek the water. When she reached the well the toad came up as he used, and asked her if she would marry him if she should get the water. 'If I have no other way to get healing for my mother, I will marry thee,' said she; and she got the water, and she healed her mother. They had betaken themselves to rest in the night when the toad came to the door saying: But he was not pleased, and he began saying, 'A chaoimheag, a chaoimheag, an cuimhneach leat an gealladh beag a thug thu aig an tobar dhomh, a ghaoil, a ghaoil.' Then she got up and made him a bed beside her own bed. But he was without ceasing, saying, 'A chaoimheag, a chaoimheag, an cuimhneach leat an gealladh beag a thug thu aig an tobar dhomh, a ghaoil, a ghaoil.' But she took no notice of his complaining, till he said to her, 'There is an old rusted glave [sword] behind thy bed, with which thou hadst better take off my head than be holding me longer in torture.' She took the glave and cut the head off him. When the steel touched him, he grew a handsome youth; and he gave many thanks to the young wife, who had been the means of putting off him the spells under which he had endured for a long time. Then he got his kingdom, for he was a king; and he married the princess, and they were long alive and merry together. The lady who has been so kind as to write down this, and other stories, is one of my oldest friends. She has brought up a large family, and her excellent memory now enables her to remember tales, which she had gathered during a long life passed in the West Highlands, where her husband was a respected minister. The story is evidently a Celtic version of the 'Wearie Well at the Warldis End,' of which Chambers has published one Scotch version, to which Grimm refers in notes 'Der Froschk\u00c3\u00b6nig,' in his third volume. There are many versions still current in Scotland, told in broad Scots; and it can be traced back to 1548. According to Grimm it belongs to the oldest in Germany. This version clearly belongs to the Gaelic language, for the speech of the frog is an imitation of the gurgling and quarking of spring frogs in a pond, which I have vainly endeavored to convey to an English reader by English letters; but which is absurdly like, when repeated in Gaelic with this intention. The persevering, obstinate repetition of the same sounds is also exceedingly like the habit of frogs, when disturbed, but not much frightened. Let anyone try the experiment of throwing a stone into the midst of a frog concert, and he will hear the songsters, after a moment of stillness, begin again. First a half-smothered guark guark; then another begins, half under water, with a gurgle, and then more and more join in till the pond is in full chorus once again. Guark, guark, gooill -- -- gooark gooill -- --. Holy healing wells are common all over the Highlands; and people still leave offerings of pins and nails, and bits of rag, though few would confess it. There is a well in Islay where I myself have, after drinking, deposited copper caps amongst a board of pins and buttons, and similar gear, placed in chinks in the rocks and trees at the edge of the 'Witches' Well.' There is another well with similar offerings, freshly place beside it in an island in Loch Maree in Ross-shire; and similar wells are to be found in many other places in Scotland. For example, I learn from Sutherland, that 'a well in the black Isle of Cromarty near Rosehaugh has miraculous healing powers. A country woman tells me that about forty years ago she remembers it being surrounded by a crowd of people every first Tuesday in June who bathed or drank of it before sunrise. Each patient tied a string or rag to one of the trees that overhung it before leaving. It was sovereign for headaches. Mr. __ remembers to have seen a well here called Mary's Well, hung round with votive rags.'

{"label": "1430", "text": "They have related that a pious man had a house in the vicinity of a merchant, and lived happily through favor of his neighborly kindness. The merchant continually sold honey and oil, and made his profits by that traffic in unctuous and sweet commodities. Inasmuch as the pious man lived a blameless life, and ever sowed in the field of his guileless heart the seed of the love of God, the merchant reposed implicit confidence in him, and took the supply of his wants upon himself. And in this very thing is the use of riches: to win over the hearts of the poor, and to raise up a perpetual provision from perishable wealth. The merchant, too, considering the opportunity of doing good a blessing, sent every day somewhat from the stock, in the buying and selling of which he was occupied, for the support of the devotee. The latter used somewhat of this and stored up the rest in a corner. In a short time a jar was filled by these means. One day the pious man looked into that jar, and thought thus to himself, 'Well, now! What quantity of honey and oil is collected in this vessel?' At last he conjectured ten mans to be there, and said: If I can sell these for ten dirhams, I can buy for that sum five ewes, and these five will each have young every six months, and each will have two lambs. Thus in a year there will be twenty-five, and in ten years from their progeny there will be herds upon herds. So by these means I shall have an abundant supply, and will sell some, and lay in a handsome stock of furniture, and wed a wife of a noble family. After nine months, I shall have a son born to me, who will study science and polite manners. However, when the weakness of infancy is exchanged for the strength of youth, and that graceful cypress grows up in the garden of manhood, it is probable that he may transgress my orders, and begin to be refractory, and in that case it will be necessary for me to correct him, and I will do so with this very staff which I hold in my hand. He then lifted up his staff, and was so immersed in thought, that, fancying the head and neck of his rebellious son before him, he brought down the staff, and struck it on the jar of honey and oil. It happened that the jar was placed on a shelf, beneath which he sat with it facing him. As soon as his staff reached the jar, it broke it, and let out the honey and oil all over the head and face and vest and hair of the pious man.", "title": "The Story of the Devotee Who Spilt the Jar of Honey and Oil", "id": 349}
{"label": "440", "text": "During the time while she was getting a living in this way, she bore a frog, which she reared there. When it was grown up, the king of that city caused this proclamation to be made by beat of tom-toms, 'I will give half my kingdom, and goods amounting to an elephant's load to the person who brings the Jeweled Golden Cock that is at the house of the Rakshasi (ogress). The frog took the bundle of rice, and hanging it from his shoulder, went to an indi (wild date) tree, scraped the leaf off a date spike (the mid-rib of the leaf), and strung the rice on it. While going away after stringing it, the frog then became like a very good-looking royal prince, and a horse and clothing for him made their appearance there. Putting on the clothes he mounted the horse, and making it bound along he went on till he came to a city. Hearing that he had arrived, the king of that city prepared quarters for this prince to stay at, and having given him ample food and drink, asked, 'Where art thou going?' Then the prince said, 'The king of our city has made a proclamation by beat of tom-toms, that he will give half his kingdom and an elephant's load of gold to the person who brings him the Jeweled Golden Cock that is at the Rakshasi's house. Because of it I am going to fetch the Jeweled Golden Cock.' The king, being pleased with the prince on account of it, gave him a piece of charcoal. 'Should you be unable to escape from the Rakshasi while returning after taking the Jeweled Golden Cock, tell this piece of charcoal to be created a fire-fence, and cast it down,' he said. Taking it, he went to another city. The king of that city in that very manner having prepared quarters, and made ready and given him food and drink, asked, 'Where art thou going?' The prince replied in the same words, 'I am going to bring the Jeweled Golden Cock that is at the house of the Rakshasi.' That king also being pleased on account of it, gave him a stone, 'Should you be unable to escape from the Rakshasi, tell this stone to be created a mountain, and cast it down,' he said. Taking the charcoal and the stone which those two kings gave him, he went to yet another city. The king also in that very manner having given him quarters, and food and drink, asked, 'Where art thou going?' The prince in that very way said, 'I am going to bring the Jeweled Golden Cock.' That king also being greatly pleased gave him a thorn. 'Should you be unable to escape from the Rakshasi, tell a thorn fence to be created, and cast down this thorn,' he said. On the next day he went to the house of the Rakshasi. She was not at home; the Rakshasi's daughter was there. That girl having seen the prince coming and not knowing him, asked 'Elder brother, elder brother, where are you going?' The prince said, 'Younger sister, I am not going anywhere whatever. I came to beg at your hands the Jeweled Golden Cock which you have got.' To that she replied, 'Elder brother, today indeed I am unable to give it. Tomorrow I can. Should my mother come now she will eat you; for that reason come and hide yourself.' Calling him into the house, she put him in a large trunk at the bottom of seven trunks, and shut him up in it. After a little time had passed, the Rakshasi came back. Having come and seen that the prince's horse was there, she asked her daughter, 'Whose is this horse?' Then the Rakshasi's daughter replied, 'Nobody's whatever. It came out of the jungle, and I caught it to ride on.' The Rakshasi having said, 'If so, it is good,' came in. While lying down to sleep at night, the sweet odor of the prince having reached the Rakshasi, she said to her daughter, 'What is this, Bola? A smell of a fresh human body is coming to me.'", "title": "The Frog Prince (Parker)", "id": 350}
{"label": "562", "text": "'You,' she said, 'come with me.' She led him to a hollow tree, a thick one. 'Climb this tree,' she said. 'Higher up there is a hole. Climb down into it. At the bottom you'll find a room where a dog is sitting on a chest. You must pick him up and set him on the floor. You can take as much money as you want from the chest, but then set the dog back where you found him. On the table there is a tinderbox. Put it in your pocket as well.' He did what she had told him to do and climbed down into the hole. Entering the room, he saw the dog seated on the chest. Its eyes were as large as a fist. 'See here,' said the soldier, 'you are a good fellow. You won't do anything to me!' He lifted the dog into his arms then set him on the floor. He opened the chest, which was filled with copper coins, and he filled his pockets with them. Then he closed the chest and set the dog back on it. He went into the second room, where there also was a light burning. He again saw a dog sitting on a chest, as in the first room, and this dog had eyes just as large as the first one. 'See here,' he said, 'you won't do anything to me. The first one didn't do anything to me.' He picked this one up as well and set him down away from the chest. He opened it, and it was filled with silver coins. He emptied out his pockets and filled them with the silver coins. Then he closed the chest and put the dog back on it. Then he went into the third room. There a dog was sitting on a chest as well, and he was as large as the first two. 'Oh,' said the soldier, 'I see that you three are good comrades. You won't do anything to me either.' He picked him up and set him on the floor. This chest was filled with gold ducats. He emptied out the silver coins and filled his pockets with ducats. Then he picked up the dog, placed him back on the chest, then returned to the tree. When he had climbed halfway up, the old woman asked, 'Do you have the tinderbox?' So he climbed back down, for he had left the tinderbox in the third room where he had filled his pockets with ducats. It was there on the table, and he put it into his pocket. He made his way back up the tree to the outside, but the old woman had disappeared. He never saw her again. He came to an inn where a baptism was being celebrated. There he took off his uniform and bought civilians' clothes for himself. He lived very well. He traveled about for nearly an entire year, finally coming to a royal city. There he took quarters in an inn. Gradually he spent all the money that he had. He owed large sum to the innkeeper. One night at bedtime he had nothing to strike a light with. There was usually something at hand, but not this time. He picked up the tinderbox, and struck one spark, when suddenly the three dogs appeared in his room. 'What is your wish?' they all three asked. 'Oh, I no longer have any money. Could you kindly bring me a chestful? 'You can always have as much money as you want from us,' said the dogs, and disappeared. Thus he outfitted himself as a cavalier. One day he was out walking when the princess came riding by in her carriage. That evening he struck a spark with his tinderbox, and the three dogs appeared. 'Give us a command!' they said. 'Bring the princess to me in her sleep!' In an instant she was there in his bed, and the dogs disappeared. Before daybreak he called the three dogs with his tinderbox, and they carried the princess back to her own bed. And thus he had her brought to him every night for two weeks. Then she said to her father, the king, 'For two weeks now I have been with this man every night at the inn.' The king summoned the soldier and asked the princess if he were the man. She said, 'Yes, he's the one.' 'How can you take my child to bed with you every night?' asked the king. 'Because she gives me pleasure,' said the soldier. The king had him thrown into prison, where he stayed for eight days with only bread and water. He was sentenced to die on the gallows. On the ninth day he was brought to a room in the castle where he was put on display for three days. Unfortunately he did not have his tinderbox with him, so he could not help himself. Happily, on the second day a servant from the inn where he had been sleeping came to get a look at him. The soldier said to him, 'You, bring my tinderbox to me. It is in the pocket of the coat hanging on the wall.' The servant returned with the tinderbox, and the soldier said to him, 'You can have the chest filled with gold and everything else that is in the room.' On the third day the king called up three hundred men who surrounded the soldier then took him to the gallows. Arriving there, the soldier said to the king, 'Every condemned person is granted three last wishes.' Then he reached into his pocket and rubbed against the tinderbox. The three dogs were suddenly there. The soldier said, 'Take them and tear them apart.' And they tore the three hundred soldiers to pieces. The king begged for mercy, asking the soldier to spare him. He said, 'I give you my princess in marriage, and you can become king as well.' Three days later they celebrated their wedding, and the three dogs sat at the table next to the soldier. Each of the dogs had a napkin, a fork, and a knife, just like the humans. After the meal the three dogs told him to call on them whenever he might need them. Then they disappeared. They were always available to him and helped him both in war and in peace.", "title": "The Deserter with the Tinderbox", "id": 351}
{"label": "280A", "text": "As the ants were airing their provisions one winter, up comes a hungry grasshopper to 'em, and begs a charity. They told him that he should have wrought in summer, if he would not have wanted in winter. 'Well,' says the grasshopper, 'but I was not idle neither; for I sung out the whole season.' 'Nay then,' said they, 'you shall e'en do well to make a merry year on't, and dance in winter to the tune that you sung in summer.' The moral: A life of sloth is the life of a brute; but action and industry is the bus'ness of a great, a wife, and a good man. Reflexion: Here's a reproof to men of sensuality, and pleasure. The moral preaches industry, and beats down sloth, and shews that after-wit is nothing worth. It must be an industrious youth that provides against the inconveniencies, and necessities of old age; and he that fools away the one, must either beg or starve in the other. 'Go to the ant thou sluggard,' says the wise-man, which in few words summs up the moral of this fable. 'Tis hard to say of laziness, or luxury, whether it be the more scandalous, or the more dangerous evil. The very soul of the slothful, does effectually but lie drowzing in his body, and the whole man is totally given up to his senses: whereas the profit and the comfort of industry, is substantial, firm, and lasting; the blessings of security and plenty go along with it, and it is never out of season. What's the grasshopper's entertainment now, but a summer's song? A vain and an empty pleasure? Let it be understood, however, that we are not to pass avarice upon the world under the title of good husbandry, and thrift, and under that cover to extinguish charity by not distributing the fruits of it. We are in the first place, to consult our own necessities, but we are then to consider in the second place that the necessities of our neighbours have a Christian right to a part of what we have to spare. For the common offices of humanity are as much duties of self-preservation, as what every individual contributes to its own well-being. It is, in short, the great interest and obligation of particulars, to advance the good of the community. The stress of this moral lies upon the preference of honest labour to idleness; and the refusal of relief, on the one hand, is intended only for a reproof to the inconsiderate loss of opportunity on the other. This does not hinder yet, but that the ants, out of their abundance, ought to have reliev'd the grasshopper in her distress, though 'twas her own fault that brought her to't. For if one man's faults could discharge another man of his duty, there would be no longer any place left for the common offices of society. To conclude, we have our failings, every mother's child of us, and the improvidence of my neighbour must not make me inhumane. The ant did well to reprove the grasshopper for her slothfulness; but she did ill then to refuse her a charity in her distress.", "title": "An Ant and a Grasshopper", "id": 352}

{"label": "332", "text": "Once upon a time there was a boy who had served a man in the northern mountains for a long time. This man was a master at ale brewing. It was so uncommonly good, the like of it was not to be found. So, when the boy was to leave his place and the man was to pay him the wages he had earned, he would take no other pay than a keg of Yule-ale. Well, he got it and set off with it, and he carried it both far and long, but the longer he carried the keg the heavier it got, and so he began to look about to see if anyone were coming with whom he might have drink, that the ale might lessen and the keg lighten. And after a long, long time, he met an old man with a big beard. 'Good day,' said the man. 'Good day to you,' said the boy. 'Where are you going?' asked the man. 'I'm looking for someone to drink with me, and lighten my keg,' said the boy. 'Can't you drink with me as well as with anyone else?' said the man. 'I have traveled both far and wide, and I am both tired and thirsty.' 'Well, why shouldn't I?' said the boy. 'But tell me, where are you from, and what sort of man are you?' 'I am the Lord, and come from Heaven,' said the man. 'I will not drink with you,' said the boy, 'for you make such distinction between persons here on earth, and you divide rights so unevenly that some get so rich and some so poor. No, I will not drink with you!' And having said this he trudged off again with his keg. When he had gone a bit farther the keg grew too heavy again. He thought he could not carry it any longer unless someone came with whom he might drink, and so lessen the ale in the keg. Yes, he met an ugly, scrawny man who came rushing along. 'Good day,' said the man. 'Good day to you,' said the boy. 'Where are you going?' asked the man. 'Oh, I'm looking for someone to drink with, and lighten my keg,' said the boy. 'Can't you drink with me as well as with anyone else?' said the man. 'I have traveled both far and wide, and I am tired and thirsty.' 'Well, why not?' said the boy. 'But who are you, and where do you come from?' 'Who am I? I am the Devil, and I come from Hell, that's where I come from,' said the man. 'No!' said the boy. 'You only torment and plague poor folk, and if there is any unhappiness astir, they always say it is your fault. I will not drink with you.' So he went far and farther than far again with his ale keg on his back, until he thought it grew so heavy there was no carrying it any farther. He began to look around again if anyone were coming with whom he could drink and lighten his keg. So after a long, long time, another man came, and he was so dried up and scrawny it was a wonder that his bones hung together. 'Good day,' said the man. 'Good day to you,' said the boy. 'Where are you going?' asked the man. 'Oh, I was only looking about to see if I could find someone to drink with, that my keg might be lightened a little, it is so heavy to carry.' 'Can't you drink with me as well as with anyone else?' said the man. 'Yes, why not?' said the boy. 'But what sort of man are you?' 'They call me Death,' said the man. 'I will gladly drink with you.,' said the boy. And as he said this he put down his keg and began to tap the ale into a bowl. 'You are a good man, for you treat all alike, both rich and poor.' So he drank to his health, and Death drank to his health, and Death said he had never tasted such drink, and as the boy was fond of him, they drank bowl after bowl until the ale was lessened, and the keg grew light. At last Death said, 'I have never known drink which tasted better, or did me so much good as this ale that you have given me, and I scarce know what to give you in return.' But after he had thought awhile, he said the keg should never get empty, however much they drank out of it, and the ale that was in it should become a healing drink, by which the boy could make the sick whole again better than any doctor. And he also said that when the boy came into a sick man's room, Death would always be there, and show himself to him, and it should be to him a sure sign if he saw Death at the foot of the bed that he could cure the sick with a draft from the keg; but if he sat by the pillow, there was no healing nor medicine, for then the sick person belonged to Death. Well, the boy soon grew famous, and was summoned far and near, and he helped many to health again who had been given up. When he came in and saw how Death sat by a sick man's bed, he foretold either life or death, and his foretelling was never wrong. He became both a rich and powerful man, and at last he was summoned to a king's daughter far, far away in the world. She was so dangerously ill that no doctor thought he could do her any good, and so they promised him all that he might ask for if he would only save her life. Now, when he came into the princess's room, there sat Death at her pillow; but as he sat he dozed and nodded, and while he did this she felt better. 'Now, life or death is at stake,' said the doctor; 'and I fear, from what I see, there is no hope.' But they said he must save her, if it cost land and realm. So he looked at Death, and while he sat there and dozed again, he made a sign to the servants to turn the bed around so quickly that Death was left sitting at the foot, and at the very moment they turned the bed, the doctor gave her the draft, and her life was spared. 'Now you have cheated me,' said Death, 'and we are quits.' 'I was forced to do it,' said the doctor, 'unless I wished to lose land and realm.' 'That shall not help you much,' said Death. 'Your time is up, for now you belong to me.' 'Well,' said the boy, 'what must be must be. But you'll let me have time to read the Lord's Prayer first?' Yes, he might have leave to do that. But he took very good care not to read the Lord's Prayer. He read everything else, but the Lord's Prayer never crossed his lips, and at last he thought he had cheated Death for good and all. But when Death thought he had really waited too long, he went to the boy's house one night, and hung up a large tablet with the Lord's Prayer painted on it over against his bed. So when the boy woke in the morning he began to read the tablet, and did not quite see what he was doing until he came to Amen. But then it was just too late, and Death had him.", "title": "The Boy with the Ale Keg", "id": 357}

But the beggar-woman wanted so badly to get her corn ground, for she had not a spoonful of meal to make either soup or porridge for the children at home. Well, at last she got leave to go into the mill and grind her corn at night. When she came there, she made a fire on the hearth, where a big pot of tar was hanging. She started the mill, and sat down by the hearth with her knitting. In a while a girl came into the mill and said 'Good evening' to her. 'Good evening,' answered the beggar-woman, and went on with her knitting. But very soon the strange girl began raking the fire out over the hearth, but the beggar-woman raked it together again. 'What's your name?: said the fairy, as you already will have guessed that the strange girl was. 'My name is Self!' answered the beggar-woman. 'The girl thought that was a strange name, and began raking the fire about again. This made the beggar-woman angry, and she began scolding and raking the fire together. They were thus employed for some time, when the beggar-woman, watching her opportunity, upset the boiling tar over the girl, who began screaming and screeching, and as she ran out of the mill, she cried, 'Father, father, Self has burnt me!'

Sheep's head and pluck!   Trudging along, he came to a stile; but in getting over he fell and hurt himself, and, beginning to blubber, forgot what he was sent for. So he stood a little while to consider; at last he thought he recollected it, and began to repeat:      Liver and lights [lungs] and gall and all!     Liver and lights and gall and all!   Away he went again, and came to where a man was sick, bawling out:      Liver and lights and gall and all!     Liver and lights and gall and all!   Whereon the man laid hold of him and beat him, bidding him say:      Pray God send no more up!     Pray God send no more up!   The youngster strode along, uttering these words, till he reached a field where a hind [farm servant] was sowing wheat:      Pray God send no more up!     Pray God send no more up!   This was all his cry. So the sower began to thrash him, and charged him to repeat:      Pray God send plenty more!     Pray God send plenty more!   Off the child scampered with these words in his mouth till he reached a churchyard and met a funeral, but he went on with his:      Pray God send plenty more!     Pray God send plenty more!   The chief mourner seized and punished him, and bade him repeat:      Pray God send the soul to heaven!     Pray God send the soul to heaven!   Away went the boy, and met a dog and a bitch going to be hung, but his cry rang out:      Pray God send the soul to heaven!     Pray God send the soul to heaven!   The good folk nearly were furious, seized and struck him, charging him to say:      A dog and a bitch a-going to be hung!     A dog and a bitch a-going to be hung!   This the poor fellow did, till he overtook a man and a woman going to be married. 'Oh! oh!' he shouted:      A dog and a bitch a-going to be hung!     A dog and a bitch a-going to be hung!   The man was enraged, as we may well think, gave him many a thump, and ordered him to repeat:      I wish you much joy!     I wish you much joy!   This he did, jogging along, till he came to two labourers who had fallen into a ditch. The lad kept bawling out:      I wish you much joy!     I wish you much joy!   This vexed one of the folk so sorely that he used all his strength, scrambled out, beat the crier, and told him to say:      The one is out, I wish the other was!

{"label": "1586", "text": "A king, while visiting his wives' apartments, took a monkey from a neighboring stable for a pet. He kept him constantly close at hand for his amusement, for as it is said, parrots, partridges, doves, rams, monkeys, and such creatures are a king's natural companions. It goes without saying that the monkey, fed on the various dishes that the king gave him, grew large and was given respect by all who surrounded the king. Indeed, the king, due to his love and exceeding trust of the monkey, even gave him a sword to carry. In the vicinity of the palace the king had a grove artfully planted with many trees of various sorts. Early in the springtime the king noticed how beautiful the grove was. Its blossoms exuded a magnificent fragrance, while swarms of bees sang praise to the god of love. Thus overcome by love, he entered the grove with his favorite wife. He ordered all his servants to wait for him at the entrance. After having pleasantly strolling through and observing the grove, he grew tired and said to his monkey, 'I want to sleep a little while in this arbor of flowers. Take care that nothing disturbs me!' Having said this, the king fell asleep. Presently a bee, pursuing the aroma of the flowers, betel, and musk, flew up and lit on his head. Seeing this, the monkey thought angrily, 'What is this? Am I to allow this common creature to bite the king before my very eyes?' With that he proceeded to drive it away. However, in spite of the monkey's defense, the bee approached the king again and again. Finally, blinded by anger, the monkey drew his sword and struck down the bee with a single blow. However, the same blow also split the king's head. The queen, who was sleeping next to the king jumped up in terror. Seeing the crime, she said, 'Oh, oh, you foolish monkey! What have you done to the king who placed such trust in you?' The monkey explained how it had happened, but thereafter he was shunned and scorned by everyone. Thus it is said, 'Do not choose a fool for a friend, for the king was killed by a monkey.'

{"label": "780", "text": "But one day came a great big wolf, and looked hungrily at the small shepherd and his fat sheep, saying, 'Little boy! shall I eat you, or your sheep?' Then the little boy answered politely, 'I don't know Mr. Wolf; I must ask my auntie.' So all day long he piped away on his tiny pipe, and in the evening, when he brought the flock home, he went to his auntie and said, 'Auntie dear, a great big wolf asked me today if he should eat me, or your sheep. Which shall it be?' Then his auntie looked at the wee little shepherd, and at the fat flock, and said sharply, 'Which shall it be? Why, you, of course!' So next morning the little boy drove his flock out into the pathless plain, and blew away cheerfully on his shepherd's pipe until the great big wolf appeared. Then he laid aside his pipe, and, going up to the savage beast, said, 'Oh, if you please, Mr. Wolf, I asked my auntie, and she says you are to eat me.' Now the wolf, savage as wolves always are, could not help having just a spark of pity for the tiny barefoot shepherd who played his pipe so sweetly, therefore he said kindly, 'Could I do anything for you, little boy, after I've eaten you?' 'Thank you!' returned the tiny shepherd. 'If you would be so kind, after you've picked the bones, as to thread my ankle-bone on a string and hang it on the tree that weeps over the pond yonder, I shall be much obliged.' So the wolf ate the little shepherd, picked the bones, and afterwards hung the ankle-bone by a string to the branches of the tree, where it danced and swung in the sunlight. Now, one day, three robbers, who had just robbed a palace, happening to pass that way, sat down under the tree and began to divide the spoil. Just as they had arranged all the golden dishes and precious jewels and costly stuffs into three heaps, a jackal howled. Now you must know that thieves always use the jackal's cry as a note of warning, so that when at the very same moment Little Anklebone's thread snapped, and he fell plump on the head of the chief robber, the man imagined some one had thrown a pebble at him, and, shouting 'Run! run! We are discovered!' he bolted away as hard as he could, followed by his companions, leaving all the treasure behind them. 'Now,' said Little Anklebone to himself, 'I shall lead a fine life!' So he gathered the treasure together, and sat under the tree that drooped over the pond, and played so sweetly on a new shepherd's pipe, that all the beasts of the forest, and the birds of the air, and the fishes of the pond came to listen to him. Then Little Anklebone put marble basins round the pond for the animals to drink out of, and in the evening the does, and the tigresses, and the she-wolves gathered round him to be milked, and when he had drank his fill he milked the rest into the pond, till at last it became a pond of milk. And Little Anklebone sat by the milken pond and piped away on his shepherd's pipe. Now, one day, an old woman, passing by with her jar for water, heard the sweet strains of Little Anklebone's pipe, and following the sound, came upon the pond of milk, and saw the animals, and the birds, and the fishes, listening to the music. She was wonderstruck, especially when Little Anklebone, from his seat under the tree, called out, 'Fill your jar, mother! All drink who come hither!' Then the old woman filled her jar with milk, and went on her way rejoicing at her good fortune. But as she journeyed she met with the king of that country, who, having been a-hunting, had lost his way in the pathless plain. 'Give me a drink of water, good mother,' he cried, seeing the jar; 'I am half dead with thirst!' 'It is milk, my son,' replied the old woman; 'I got it yonder from a milken pond.' Then she told the king of the wonders she had seen, so that he resolved to have a peep at them himself. And when he saw the milken pond, and all the animals and birds and fishes gathered round, while Little Anklebone played ever so sweetly on his shepherd's pipe, he said 'I must have the tiny piper, if I die for it!' No sooner did Little Anklebone hear these words than he set off at a run, and the king after him. Never was there such a chase before or since, for Little Anklebone hid himself amid the thickest briars and thorns, and the king was so determined to have the tiny piper, that he did not care for scratches. At last the king was successful, but no sooner did he take hold of Little Anklebone than it began to thunder and lighten horribly, whilst the little piper himself began to sing these words: So the little piper went back to his seat under the tree by the pond, and there he sits still, and plays his shepherd's pipe, while all the beasts of the forest, and birds of the air, and fishes of the pond, gather round and listen to his music. And sometimes, people wandering through the pathless plain hear the pipe, and then they say, 'That is Little Anklebone, who was eaten by a wolf ages ago!'", "title": "Little Anklebone (Anklebone)", "id": 361}

{"label": "124", "text": "Once upon a time there were three goslings who were greatly afraid of the wolf, for if he found them he would eat them. One day the largest said to the other two, 'Do you know what I think? I think we had better build a little house, so that the wolf shall not eat us, and meanwhile let us go and look for something to build the house with.' Then the other two said, 'Yes, yes, yes! Good! Let us go!' So they went and found a man who had a load of straw and said to him, 'Good man, do us the favor to give us a little of that straw to make a house of, so that the wolf shall not eat us.' The man said, 'Take it, take it!' And he gave them as much as they wanted. The goslings thanked the man and took the straw and went away to a meadow, and there they built a lovely little house, with a door, and balconies, and kitchen, with everything, in short. When it was finished, the largest gosling said, 'Now I want to see whether one is comfortable in this house.' So she went in and said, 'Oh! How comfortable it is in the house! Just wait!' She went and locked the door with a padlock, and went out on the balcony and said to the other two goslings, 'I am very comfortable alone here. Go away, for I want nothing to do with you.' The two poor little goslings began to cry and beg their sister to open the door and let them in. If she did not, the wolf would eat them. But she would not listen to them. Then the two goslings went away and found a man who had a load of hay. They said to him, 'Good man, do us the kindness to give us a little of that hay to build a house with, so that the wolf shall not eat us!' 'Yes, yes, yes! Take some, take some!' And he gave them as much as they The goslings, well pleased, thanked the man and carried the hay to a meadow and built a very pretty little house, prettier than the other. The middle-sized gosling said the smallest, 'Listen. I am going now to see whether one is comfortable in this house. But I will not act like our sister, you know!' She entered the house and said to herself, 'Oh! How comfortable it is here! I don't want my sister! I am very comfortable here alone.' So she went and fastened the door with a padlock, and went out on the balcony and said to her sister, 'Oh! How comfortable it is in this house! I don't want you here! Go away, go away!' The gosling began to weep and beg her sister to open to her, for she was alone, and did not know where to go, and if the wolf found her he would eat her. But it did no good. She shut the balcony and stayed in the house. Then the gosling, full of fear, went away and found a man who had a load of iron and stones and said to him, 'Good man, do me the favor to give me a few of those stones and a little of that iron to build me a house with, so that the wolf shall not eat me!' The man pitied the gosling so much that he said, 'Yes, yes, good gosling, or rather I will build your house for you.' Then they went away to a meadow, and the man built a very pretty house, with a garden and everything necessary, and very strong, for it was lined with iron, and the balcony and door of iron also. The gosling, well pleased, thanked the man and went into the house and remained there. Now let us go to the wolf. The wolf looked everywhere for these goslings, but could not find them. After a time he learned that they had built three houses. 'Good, good! he said. 'Wait until I find you!' Then he started out and journeyed and journeyed until he came to the meadow where the first house was. He knocked at the door, and the gosling said, 'Who is knocking at the door?' 'Come, come,' said the wolf. 'Open up, for it is I.' 'The gosling said, 'I will not open for you, because you will eat me.' 'Open, open! I will not eat you. Be not afraid. Very well, ' said the wolf, 'if you will not open the door, I will blow down your house.' And indeed, he did blow down the house and ate up the gosling. 'Now that I have eaten one,' he said, 'I will eat the others too.' Then he went away and came at last to the house of the second gosling, and everything happened as to the first. The wolf blew down the house and ate the gosling. Then he went in search of the third, and when he found her he knocked at the door, but she would not let him in. Then he tried to blow the house down, but could not. Then he climbed on the roof and tried to trample the house down, but in vain. 'Very well,' he said to himself. 'In one way or another I will eat you.' Then he came down from the roof and said to the gosling, 'Listen, gosling. Do you wish us to make peace? I don't want to quarrel with you who are so good, and I have thought that tomorrow we will cook some macaroni, and I will bring the butter and cheese, and you will furnish the flour.' 'Very good,' said the gosling. 'Bring them then.' The wolf, well satisfied, saluted the gosling and went away. The next day the gosling got up early and went and bought the meal and then returned home and shut the house. A little later the wolf came and knocked at the door and said, 'Come, gosling, open the door, for I have brought you the butter and cheese!' 'Very well, give it to me here by the balcony.' 'No indeed, open the door!' 'I will open when all is ready.' Then the wolf gave her the things by the balcony and went away. While he was gone the gosling prepared the macaroni, and put it on the fire to cook in a kettle full of water. When it was two o'clock the wolf came and said, 'Come, gosling, open the door.' 'No, I will not open, for when I am busy I don't want anyone in the way. When it is cooked, I will open, and you may come in and eat it.' A little while after, the gosling said to the wolf, 'Would you like to try a bit of macaroni to see whether it is well cooked?' 'Open the door! That is the better way.' 'No, no. Don't think you are coming in. Put your mouth to the hole in the shelf, and I will pour the macaroni down.' The wolf, all greedy as he was, put his mouth to the hole, and then the gosling took the kettle of boiling water and poured the boiling water instead of the macaroni through the hole into the wolf's mouth. And the wolf was scalded and killed. Then the gosling took a knife and cut open the wolf's stomach, and out jumped the other goslings, who were still alive, for the wolf was so greedy that he had swallowed them whole. Then there goslings begged their sister's pardon for the mean way in which they had treated her, and she, because she was kindhearted, forgave them and took them into her house, and there they ate their macaroni and lived together happy and contented.

They begged him to deed his property to them, promising that in return they would care for him the rest of his life. They would provide him with his own room and give him the best things to eat and drink. So the father deeded his property to them, and during the first year all went well. But the next year, when he spent more time with the one daughter than with the others, she said to him, 'Father, you are a burden to me. Go to the others; they received just as much from you as I did.' The good father could now see very well that he was no longer wanted, and asked a neighbor for advice. The neighbor gave him an old chest filled with sand and stones. The father had the chest carried to where he was staying, then asked his daughter to lend him a scoop and three candles, for he had something that he wanted to measure. He sat up half the night making a clinging sound as if it were gold coins. The next morning he gave the scoop back to the daughter, leaving one old Bohemian coin in it. She said, 'Father, you were clinging in the night as if you were measuring gold coins. I heard it.' He said, 'I set aside some money for myself in a chest, and I am going to leave it to the one of you who is the most friendly toward me.'

{"label": "500", "text": "Ages ago, in olden times, there lived a powerful count. All the lands far and wide belonged to him, and he had everything that his heart desired. He shared his wealth and his happiness with a good wife, who was as beautiful as the day and as dear as an angel. They had lived together happily together for several months, and the days seemed to them to be as short as minutes. One day the count was out hunting and went deeper and deeper into the forest. In the heat of the hunt he went further than ever before, and he became separated a good distance from the rest of his party. As he stood there alone in the forest, a dwarf suddenly appeared before him. The little forest dweller was only three feet tall, and his full beard reached his knees. Angrily he rolled his fiery red eyes and said, 'What are you doing here? This is my realm, and you must pay a penalty to me. If you do not give me your wife, you shall not leave this forest alive.' The count was considerably frightened by the dwarf's appearance and his angry words, for he had often heard all kinds of spooky stories about strength and the wickedness of the little man of the forest. His old nurse had told him these stories when he was but a child. What was he to do? This was a critical situation. The frightened count did not know how to escape other than to try to beg and talk his way out. 'Forgive me,' said the count, 'that I have trespassed upon your realm. I did not know that it was yours, and I will certainly never do it again.' But the wild dwarf would not be pacified, and he said, 'What I have said to you must happen. Either you or she.' 'Demand what else you will, and I shall give it to you,' said the count, 'but do not insist upon this.' Then the little man appeared to reconsider, and he said, 'If must be so, then I will place your fate in your wife's hands. I will give you both one month's time. If she is able, in three attempts, to guess my name then she shall be yours and free -- otherwise she shall belong to me.' The count was somewhat comforted with this, but still his heart was burdened. He made his way toward home, accompanied by the little man of the forest. Both were serious, and neither spoke a word. After they had gone some distance they came to an ancient gray-bearded fir tree. The dwarf stopped here and said, 'This is the boundary of my realm. I will await your wife here at this fir tree, which is nine times older than the other trees. Three times she may have three guesses! But if you do not keep your word it will go badly for both of you.' The count now walked slowly homeward, for his heart was heavy, and the closer he came to his castle, the gloomier and sadder he became. As he approached the gate, the countess, who had seen him from her window, came out to meet him. She was filled with joy and happiness, for her husband was home again. But she soon noticed that he was not happy, as he usually was, but instead looked like seven days of rainy weather. This made her sad and concerned, and she asked the count what was wrong with him. As soon as they entered the castle and were in the sitting room, the tired and sad count told her how he had met the dwarf and how he had wanted take the countess, and what conditions he had at last agreed to. When the countess heard this, she became as pale as a corpse, and her beautiful, fine cheeks were wet with tears. Happiness and joy had now disappeared from the castle, and everyone there became silent and sad. The countess most often sat in an alcove thinking and thinking how short her happiness had been, or she went to the castle chapel where she prayed and cried. The count no longer went out hunting nor to the jousting matches but sat instead on his old chair, richly decorated with carvings, on which his ancestors had also sat. Supporting his head with his right hand, he contemplated, but he himself did not know about what. Thus passed day after day and week after week, until finally there were three days left in the month. The count and countess went out into the forest, then further and further until they could see the old gray-bearded fir tree in the distance. The count stayed behind, and the countess proceeded alone. Otherwise it was beautiful in the forest. The birds were singing; the squirrels were jumping about or sitting there splitting pine cones; and the wild roses were blossoming so beautifully white and red. But the countess had a heavy heart as never before, and she sadly walked on until she came to the fir tree. The dwarf, beautifully dressed in green and red, was waiting for her. A mischievous pleasure overcame him when he saw the countess, for she pleased him greatly. 'Now guess my name, Lady Countess!' he said quickly, as though he hardly expected her to do so. Then the countess guessed, 'Fir, Spruce, Pine,' because she thought that for living in the forest he would certainly have the name of a tree. The dwarf had hardly heard this when he broke out laughing and rejoicing until the entire forest resounded. 'You have not guessed it!' he said gleefully. 'See if you can do any better tomorrow than you did today. Otherwise you will become my wife!' The countess, sadder still, walked away from the fir tree with downcast eyes. The dwarf stood there and smiled at her, taking pleasure in her grief. She soon found her husband, and told him how she had guessed so badly. They returned to their castle even sadder than they had left. The rest of the day passed too fast, although it was a sad one. Evening was soon there, and night followed quickly. It was a sad and hopeless night, and neither sleep nor dreams entered the count's room. When the first larks began to sing the next morning, the count and countess were already up and concerned about their plight. They went to the castle chapel to pray, and afterward went out into the dark green forest, then further and deeper until they saw the old gray-bearded fir tree in the distance. The count stayed behind and the countess proceeded alone. Otherwise it was beautiful out there in the forest. The birds were singing; the flowers were laughing and giving off their sweet scent; the squirrels were standing up like little men. But the countess had a heavy heart as never before, and with tears in her eyes she walked on until she came to the fir tree. She had scarcely arrived there when the little man of the forest walked up, dressed beautifully in blue and red. A mischievous pleasure overcame him when he saw the countess, for she pleased him greatly. 'Now guess my name, Lady Countess!' he said quickly, and smiled. Then the countess guessed, 'Oat, Buckwheat, Maize,' for she thought that he might have the name of a grain. The little elf had hardly heard this when he broke out laughing and rejoicing until the entire forest resounded. 'You have not guessed it!' he said gleefully. 'You must do better tomorrow, or you will belong to me, and tomorrow will be my wedding.' The countess, sadder than ever before, walked away from the fir tree with wet eyes. The dwarf stood there impishly smiling at her. She soon found her husband, and told him how badly she had done. They returned to their castle even more gloomily than they had left. The rest of the day passed under a shadow of sorrow. Evening was there before they realized it, and the dark night followed quickly. It was again a sad night, in which neither the count nor the countess closed their eyes. As morning dawned, the count and countess were already up. They went to the castle chapel and prayed fervently. Then they went out into the beautiful green forest. It was still early, early in the morning, and many of the birds were still lying asleep in their nests. Only the brooks were rustling and murmuring, and the morning breezes were whispering through the tree branches. Otherwise it was quiet -- as quiet as in a church. The count and countess walked until they saw the old gray-bearded fir tree in the distance. There the count kissed his beautiful countess, and a tear dropped onto his beard, for he did not know if he would ever see her again. The countess, however was more composed today, and her heart was not beating as quickly as it had done on the earlier occasions. She said good-bye to her husband and walked toward the fir tree. All soul alone, she stood there next to the old tree, but the dwarf was nowhere to be seen. On either side there were wild rosebushes, and they made a beautiful fence. She walked along the path and soon came to a beautiful little valley. The most beautiful flowers were there, with vineyards and fig trees growing on the hillsides. In the middle of the field stood a neat little cottage. Its little windows glistened happily in the morning sunshine. Blue smoke curled upward from the little chimney, and a song sounded from within. The countess forgot her pain and grief when she saw the little valley and the cottage. She crept up and, on tip-toes, looked inside the window to see if it was as beautiful inside as it was outside. She saw a lovely little kitchen, with things cooking and frying in pots and pans. The little man of the forest was standing at the hearth, first tending to one thing and then to another, at the same time singing with a smiling mouth: The countess had heard enough. She crept away and hurried back to the fir tree, so that the dwarf would not overtake her. Joyfully standing there, she could almost not wait for the dwarf to arrive. It was not long before the little man arrived. Today he was dressed even more beautifully than before. His clothing was embroidered with red and gold, and it glistened like a sunrise. 'Guess now for the last time,' said the little elf to the countess, as though he had wanted to say, 'This bird will not escape from my trap.' The countess started to say 'Pur,' while carefully observing her questioner. 'Not right! You have two guesses left!' said the little man. 'Goat,' replied the countess. With that the dwarf blushed a little and seemed to pause and think. Then he said, 'Guess quickly! You have one more chance.' 'Purzinigele!' cried out the countess, filled with joy. Upon hearing his name, the dwarf angrily rolled his fiery red eyes, clenched his fists tightly, then grumbling disappeared into the thicket. The freed countess hurried back to the place where the count was impatiently waiting for her. There was such joy when the two found one another again. To the joy of their people, the count and countess returned to their castle. They lived there many, many years as the happiest couple that anyone ever knew. And what became of Purzinigele? He was so angry that he ran away, and was never seen again.", "title": "Purzinigele", "id": 366}

Her grandmother was sick and her mother sent her with some food to her, and she told her not to speak to anyone on her way. She went along however, and it was not long until she met a wolf. He asked her where she was going, and she said that she was going to see her grandmother who was sick. The wolf said, 'All right' and went away. He ran as quickly as he could, and he reached the house before her, and he went into the room and ate the grandmother. He then put on her hat and coat and went into the bed. When Red Ridinghood arrived she knocked at the door, and the wolf said, 'Lift the catch and walk in.' She did so and went into the room. When she saw the wolf inside she thought it was her grandmother, but she thought she had very big eyes and mouth. 'Grandma what great big eyes you have,' she said. 'Just for to see you, my dear,' said the wolf. 'Grandma, what great ears you have.' 'Just for to hear my dear.' 'Grandma what great big mouth you have.' 'Just for to eat you my dear,' and he jumped out of the bed and ate her. I got this story from Thomas Burke, Cluide, Corrandulla, Co. Galway. Aged 43 years.

{"label": "480", "text": "She said one day to the bad one: 'Go and draw a bucket of water.' The bad one did not want to go, and so she would not obey her mother. The good daughter, however, said: 'I will go and draw it.' She went to draw the water, and the bucket fell down the well. She said: 'If I go home now without the bucket, who knows what my mother will do to me?' So she climbed down the well, and at the bottom found a narrow passage, with a door. She knocked at the door. 'Have you not found a cord and bucket?' There was a saint there, who answered: 'No, my child.' She continued her way and found another door. 'Have you not found a cord and bucket?' 'No!' That was the devil there. He answered her angrily because she was a good girl; he did not say: 'My child.' She knocked at another door. 'Have you not found a cord and bucket?' It was the Madonna who replied: 'Yes, my child. Listen. You could do me a pleasure to stay here while I am away. I have my little son here, to whom you will give his soup; you will sweep and put the house in order. When I come home I will give you your bucket.' The Madonna went away, and the good girl put the house in order, gave the child his broth, swept the house; and while she was sweeping, instead of finding dirt, she found coral and other beautiful things. She saw that it was not dirt, and put it aside to give the Madonna when she returned. When the Madonna came back, she asked: 'Have you done all I told you to do?' The good girl answered: 'Yes, but I have kept these things here; I found them on the ground; it is not dirt.' 'Very well; keep them for yourself. Would you like a dress of calico, or one of silk?' The girl answered: 'No, no! a calico dress.' Instead of that, the Madonna gave her the silk one. 'Do you wish a brass thimble, or a silver one?' 'Give me the brass one.' 'No, take the silver thimble. Here is the bucket and your cord. When you reach the end of this passage, look up in the air.' The girl did so, and a beautiful star fell on her brow. She went home, and her mother ran to meet her to scold her for being away so long; and was about to strike her, when she saw the star on her brow, which shone so that it was beautiful to see, and said: 'Where have you been until now? Who put that thing on your forehead?' The girl answered: 'I don't know what there is there.' Her mother tried to wash it away, but instead of disappearing, it shone more beautiful than ever. Then the girl told what had happened to her, and the other sister wished to go there, too. She went, and did the same as her sister. She let the bucket fall, climbed down, and knocked at the saint's door. 'Have you not found a cord and bucket?' 'No, my child.' She knocked at the next door. 'Have you not found a cord and bucket?' The devil answered: 'No, I have not found them; but come here, my child, come here.' But when she heard that he had not found her bucket, she said: 'No, I will go on.' She knocked at the Madonna's door. 'Have you not found a cord and bucket?' The Madonna said that she had. 'I am going away: you will give my son his broth, and then you will sweep. When I return I will give you your bucket.' Instead of giving the broth to the child, the bad girl ate it herself. 'Oh!' she said, 'how good it was!' She swept and found a great deal of dirt. 'Oh, poor me! My sister found so many pretty things!' The Madonna returned. 'Have you done what I told you?' 'Yes.' 'Do you wish the brass or silver thimble?' 'Oh! I want the silver one!' She gave her the brass one. 'Do you want the calico dress or the silk one?' 'Give me the silk dress.' She gave her the calico dress. 'Here is your bucket and cord. When you are out of here, look up into the air.' When she was out she looked up into the air and there fell on her forehead a lump of dirt that soiled her whole face. She went home in a rage to weep and scold her sister because she had had the star, while she had that dirt on her face. Her mother began to wash her face and rub it; and the more she did so the less the dirt went away. Then the mother said: 'I understand; the Madonna has done this to show me that I loved the bad girl and neglected the good one.'", "title": "The Bucket", "id": 368}

{"label": "105", "text": "There lived on the other side of the ocean a Vaicya (commoner) who had an abundance of wealth and corn. He performed sacrifices, made liberal gifts, was peaceful, devoted to the duties of his own order, and pure in habits and mind. He had many sons whom he loved, and was kind unto all creatures. He lived fearlessly in the dominions of a king that was guided by virtue. There was a crow that lived on the refuse of the dishes set before those well-behaved young children of the Vaicya. Those Vaicya children always gave the crow meat and curds, and milk, and sugared milk with rice, and honey, and butter. Thus fed with the refuse of their dishes by the young children of that Vaicya, the crow became arrogant and came to disregard all birds that were equal to him or even superior. It chanced that on a time certain swans of cheerful hearts, of great speed and capable of going everywhere at will and equal unto Garuda himself in range and speed of flight, came to that side of the ocean. The Vaicya boys, beholding those swans, addressed the crow and said, 'O ranger of the skies, thou art superior to all winged creatures!' Deceived by those children of little understanding, that oviparous creature, from folly and pride, regarded their words to be true. Proud of the refuse of the children's dishes upon which he fed, the crow then, alighting in the midst of those swans capable of traversing great distances, desired to enquire as to who amongst them was their leader. The foolish crow at last challenged him amongst those birds of tireless wings whom he regarded their leader, saying, 'Let us compete in flight!' Hearing those words of the raving crow, the swans that had been assembled there, those foremost of birds endued with great strength, began to laugh. The swans then, that were capable of going everywhere at will, addressed the crow, saying, 'We are swans, having our abode in the Manasa lake. We traverse the whole earth, and amongst winged creatures we are always applauded for the length of the distances we traverse! Being, as thou art, only a crow, how canst thou, O fool, challenge a swan endued with might, capable of going everywhere at will, and doing large distances in course of his flight? Tell us, O crow, how thou shalt fly with us!' The boastful crow, in consequence of the foolishness of his species, repeatedly finding fault with the words of that swan, at last gave this answer. The crow said, 'I shall, without doubt, fly, displaying a hundred and one different kinds of motion! Doing every hundred Yojanas in a separate and beautiful kind of motion, I shall display all those motions! Rising up, and swooping down, and whirling around, and coursing straight, and proceeding gently, and advancing steadily, and performing the diverse courses up and down in a slanting direction, and floating still, and wheeling around, and receding back, and soaring high, and darting forward, and soaring upwards with fiercer velocity, and once more proceeding gently and then proceeding with great impetuosity, and once again swooping down and whirling around, and advancing steadily, and rising up and up by jerks, and soaring straight, and once more falling down, and wheeling in a circle, and rushing proudly, and diverse other kinds of motion, -- these all I shall display in the sight of all you! Ye shall then witness my strength! With one of these different kinds of motion I shall presently rise into the sky. Point out duly, ye swans, by which of these motions I shall course through space. Settling the kind of motion amongst yourselves, you will have to course with me. Adopting all those different motions, ye shall have to course with me through supportless space!' The crow having said these words, one of the swans addressed him. The swan spoke, 'Thou, O crow, wilt doubtless fly the hundred and one different kinds of flight! I shall, however, fly in that one kind of motion that all other birds know, for I do not, O crow, know any other! As regards thee, O thou of red eyes, fly thou in any kind of course that thou likest!' At these words, those crows that bad been assembled there laughed aloud, saying, 'How will the swan by only one kind of flight get the better of a hundred different kinds of flight?' Then those two, viz., the swan and the crow, rose into the sky, challenging each other. Capable of going everywhere at will, the swan proceeded in one kind of motion, while the crow coursed in a hundred different kinds. And the swan flew and the crow also flew, causing each other to wonder at his skill and each speaking highly of his own achievements. Beholding the diverse kinds of flight at successive instants of time, the crows that were there were filled with great joy and began to caw more loudly. The swans also laughed in mockery, uttering many remarks disagreeable to the crows. And they began to soar and alight repeatedly, here and there. And they began to come down and rise up from tree-tops and the surface of the earth. And they uttered diverse cries indicative of their victory. The swan, however, with that one kind of slow motion with which he was familiar began to traverse the skies. For a moment, therefore, he seemed to yield to the crow. The crows, at this, disregarding the swans, said these words: 'That swan amongst you which has soared into the sky, is evidently yielding!' Hearing these words, the soaring swan flew westwards with great velocity to the ocean. Then fear entered the heart of the crow who became almost senseless at not seeing any island or trees whereon to perch when tired. And the crow thought within his heart as to where he should alight when tired, upon that vast expanse of water. The ocean, being as it is the abode of countless creatures, is irresistible. Dwelt in by hundreds of monsters, it is grander than space. Nothing can exceed it in depth! Men know that the waters of the ocean are as limitless as space. For the extent of its waters, what is a crow to it? The swan, having traversed a great distance in a moment, looked back at the crow, and, though capable, could not leave him behind. Having transgressed the crow, the swan cast his eyes on him and waited, thinking, 'Let the crow come up.' The crow then, exceedingly tired, came up to the swan. Beholding him succumbing, and about to sink, and desirous of rescuing him in remembrance of the practices of good folks, the swan addressed him in these words: 'Thou hadst repeatedly spoken of many kinds of flight while speaking on the subject! Thou wouldst not speak of this, thy present motion, because of its having been a mystery to us? What is the name of this kind of flight, O crow, that thou hast now adopted? Thou touchest the waters with thy wings and beak repeatedly. Which amongst those diverse kinds of flight is this, O crow, that thou art now practicing? Come, come, quickly, O crow, for I am waiting for thee!' Exceedingly afflicted, and touching the water with his wings and beak, the crow, beheld in that state by the swan, addressed the latter. Indeed, not seeing the limit of that watery expanse, and sinking down in fatigue, and exhausted with the effort of his flight, the crow said unto the swan, 'We are crows, we wander hither and thither, crying caw, caw! O swan, I seek thy protection, placing my life-breaths at thy hands! Oh, take me to the shores of the ocean!' Exceedingly afflicted, and touching the ocean with his wings and beak, the crow, very much fatigued, suddenly fell down. Beholding him fallen upon the waters of the ocean with a melancholy heart, the swan, addressing the crow who was on the point of death, said these words: 'Remember, O crow, what thou hadst said in praise of thyself! Thy words even were that thou wouldst course through the sky in a hundred and one different kinds of flight. Thou, therefore, that wouldst fly a hundred different kinds of flight, thou that art superior to me, alas, why then art thou tired and fallen down on the ocean?' Overcome with weakness, the crow then, casting his eyes upwards at the swan, and seeking to gratify him, replied, saying, 'Proud of the remains of others' dishes upon which I fed, I had, O swan, regarded myself as the equal of Garuda, and had disregarded all crows and many other birds! I now, however, seek thy protection and place my life-breaths at thy hands! Oh, take me to the shores of some island! If, O swan, I can, O lord, return in safety to my own country, I will never again disregard anybody! Oh, rescue me now from this calamity!' Him that said so and was so melancholy and weeping and deprived of his senses, him that was sinking in the ocean, uttering cries of caw, caw, him so drenched by the water and so disgusting to look at and trembling with fear, the swan, without a word, took up with his feet and slowly caused to ride on his back. Having caused the crow whose senses had deserted him to ride upon his back, the swan quickly returned to that island whence thy had both flown, challenging each other. Placing down that ranger of the sky on dry land and comforting him, the swan, fleet as the mind, proceeded to the region he desired. Thus was that crow, fed on the remains of others' dinners, vanquished by the swan. The crow, then, casting off the pride of might and energy, adopted a life of peace and quiet.", "title": "The Crow and the Swan", "id": 370}
{"label": "592", "text": "Morgan is one of the oldest names in Cymric land. It means one who lives near the sea. Every day, for centuries past, tens of thousands of Welsh folks have looked out on the great blue plain of salt water. It is just as true, also, that there are all sorts of Morgans. One of these named Taffy, was like nearly all Welshmen, in that he was very fond of singing. The trouble in his case, however, was that no one but himself loved to hear his voice, which was very disagreeable. Yet of the sounds which he himself made with voice or instrument, he was an intense admirer. Nobody could persuade him that his music was poor and his voice rough. He always refused to improve. Now in Wales, the bard, or poet, who makes up his poetry or song as he goes along, is a very important person, and it is not well to offend one of these gentlemen. In French, they call such a person by a very long name -- the improvisator. These poets have sharp tongues and often say hard things about people whom they do not like. If they used whetstones, or stropped their tongues on leather, as men do their razors, to give them a keener edge, their words could not cut more terribly. Now, on one occasion, Morgan had offended one of these bards. It was while the poetic gentleman was passing by Taffy's house. He heard the jolly fellow inside singing, first at the top and then at the bottom of the scale. He would drop his voice down on the low notes and then again rise to the highest until it ended in a screech. Someone on the street asked the poet how he liked the music which he had heard inside. 'Music?' replied the bard with a sneer. 'Is that what Morgan is trying? Why! I thought it was first the lowing of an aged cow, and then the yelping of a blind dog, unable to find its way. Do you call that music?' The truth was that when the soloist had so filled himself with strong ale that his brain was fuddled, then it was hard to tell just what kind of a noise he was making. It took a wise man to discover the tune, if there was any. One evening, when Morgan thought his singing unusually fine, and felt sorry that no one heard him, he heard a knock. Instead of going to the door to inquire, or welcome the visitor, he yelled out 'Come in!' The door opened and there stood three tired looking strangers. They appeared to be travelers. One of them said: 'Kind sir, we are weary and worn, and would be glad of a morsel of bread. If you can give us a little food, we shall not trouble you further.' 'Is that all?' said Morgan. 'See there the loaf and the cheese, with a knife beside them. Take what you want, and fill your bags. No man shall ever say that Taffy Morgan denied anyone food, when he had any himself.' Whereupon the three travelers sat down and began to eat. Meanwhile, without being invited to do so, their host began to sing for them. Now the three travelers were fairies in disguise. They were journeying over the country, from cottage to cottage, visiting the people. They came to reward all who gave them a welcome and were kind to them, but to vex and play tricks upon those who were stingy, bad tempered, or of sour disposition. Turning to Taffy before taking leave, one of them said: 'You have been good to us and we are grateful. Now what can we do for you? We have power to grant anything you may desire. Please tell us what you would like most.' At this, Taffy looked hard in the faces of the three strangers, to see if one of them was the bard who had likened his voice in its ups and downs to a cow and a blind dog. Not seeing any familiar face, he plucked up his courage, and said: 'If you are not making fun of me, I'll take from you a harp. And, if I can have my wish in full, I want one that will play only lively tunes. No sad music for me!' Here Morgan stopped. Again he searched their faces, to see if they were laughing at him and then proceeded. 'And something else, if I can have it; but it's really the same thing I am asking for.' 'Speak on, we are ready to do what you wish,' answered the leader. 'I want a harp, which, no matter how badly I may play, will sound out sweet and jolly music.' 'Say no more,' said the leader, who waved his hand. There was a flood of light, and, to Morgan's amazement, there stood on the floor a golden harp. But where were the three travelers? They had disappeared in a flash. Hardly able to believe his own eyes, it now dawned upon him that his visitors were fairies. He sat down, back of the harp, and made ready to sweep the strings. He hardly knew whether or not he touched the instrument, but there rolled out volumes of lively music, as if the harp itself were mad. The tune was wild and such as would set the feet of young folks a-going, even in church. As Taffy's fingers seemed every moment to become more skillful, the livelier the music increased, until the very dishes rattled on the cupboard, as if they wanted to join in. Even the chair looked as if about to dance. Just then, Morgan's wife and some neighbors entered the house. Immediately, the whole party, one and all, began dancing in the jolliest way. For hours, they kept up the mad whirl. Yet all the while, Taffy seemed happier and the women the merrier. No telegraph ever carried the news faster, all over the region, that Morgan had a wonderful harp. All the grass in front of the house, was soon worn away by the crowds that came to hear and dance. As soon as Taffy touched the harp strings, the feet of everyone, young and old, began shuffling, nor could anyone stop, so long as Morgan played. Even very old, lame and one-legged people joined in. Several old women, whom nobody had ever prevailed upon to get out of their chairs, were cured of their rheumatism. Such unusual exercise was severe for them, but it seemed to be healthful. A shrewd monk, the business manager of the monastery near by, wanted to buy Morgan's house, set up a sanatorium and advertise it as a holy place. He hoped thus to draw pilgrims to it and get for it a great reputation as a healing place for the lame and the halt, the palsied and the rheumatic. Thus the monastery would be enriched and all the monks get fat. But Taffy was a happy-go-lucky fellow, who cared little about money and would not sell; for, with his harp, he enjoyed both fun and fame. One day, in the crowd that stood around his door waiting to begin to hop and whirl, Morgan espied the bard who had compared his voice to a cow and a cur. The bard had come to see whether the stories about the harp were true or not. He found to his own discomfort what was the fact and the reality, which were not very convenient for him. As soon as the harp music began, his feet began to go up, and his legs to kick and whirl. The more Morgan played, the madder the dance and the wilder the antics of the crowd, and in these the bard had to join, for he could not help himself. Soon they all began to spin round and round on the flagstones fronting the door, as if crazy. They broke the paling of the garden fence. They came into the house and knocked over the chairs and sofa, even when they cracked their shins against the wood. They bumped their heads against the walls and ceiling, and some even scrambled over the roof and down again. The bard could no more stop his weary legs than could the other lunatics. To Morgan his revenge was so sweet, that he kept on until the bard's legs snapped, and he fell down on top of people that had tumbled from shear weariness, because no more strength was left in them. Meanwhile, Morgan laughed until his jaws were tired and his stomach muscles ached. But no sooner did he take his fingers off the strings, to rest them, than he opened his eyes in wonder; for in a flash the harp had disappeared. He had made a bad use of the fairies' gift, and they were displeased. So both the monk and Morgan felt sorry. Yet the grass grew again when the quondam harper and singer ceased desolating the air with his quavers. The air seemed sweeter to breathe, because of the silence. However, the fairies kept on doing good to the people of good will, and today some of the sweetest singers in Wales come from the poorest homes.", "title": "The Golden Harp", "id": 371}
{"label": "955", "text": "Once upon a time when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, there was a beautiful woman of the town, called Sulasa, who had a train of five hundred courtesans, and whose price was a thousand pieces a night. There was in the same city a robber named Sattuka, as strong as an elephant, who used to enter rich men's houses at night and plunder at will. The townsmen assembled and complained to the king. The king ordered the city-watch to post bands here and there, have the robber caught and cut off his head. They bound his hands behind his back and led him to the place of execution, scourging him in every square with whips. The news that he was taken excited the whole city. Sulasa was standing at a window, and looking down on the street she saw the robber, loved him at sight and thought, 'If I can free that stout fighting-man, I will give up this bad life of mine and live respectably with him.' In the way described in the Kanavera Birth she gained his freedom by sending a thousand pieces to the chief constable of the city and then lived with him in delight and harmony. The robber after three or four months thought, 'I shall never be able to stay in this one place: but one can't go empty-handed: Sulasa's ornaments are worth a hundred thousand pieces: I will kill her and take them.' So he said to her one day, 'Dear, when I was being hauled along by the king's men, I promised an offering to a tree-deity on a mountaintop, who is now threatening me because I have not paid it: let us make an offering.' 'Very well, husband, prepare and send it.' 'Dear, it will not do to send it: let us both go and present it, wearing all our ornaments and with a great retinue.' 'Very well, husband, we'll do so.' He made her prepare the offering and when they reached the mountain-foot, he said, 'Dear, the deity, seeing this crowd of people, will not accept the offering; let us two go up and present it.' She consented, and he made her carry the vessel. He was himself armed to the teeth, and when they reached the top, he set the offering at the foot of a tree which grew beside a precipice a hundred times as high as a man, and said, 'Dear, I have not come to present the offering, I have come with the intention of killing you and going away with all your ornaments: take them all off and make a bundle of them in your outer garment.' 'Husband, why would you kill me?' 'For your money.' 'Husband, remember the good I have done you: when you were being hauled along in chains, I gave up a rich man's son for you and paid a large sum and saved your life: though I might get a thousand pieces a day, I never look at another man: such a benefactress I am to you: do not kill me, I will give you much money and be your slave.' With these entreaties she spoke the first stanza: Here is a golden necklace, and emeralds and pearls, Take all and welcome: give me place among thy servant girls. When Sattuka had spoken the second stanza in accordance with his purpose, to wit: Fair lady, lay thy jewels down and do not weep so sore: I'll kill thee: else I can't be sure thou'lt give me all thy store: Sulasa's wits rose to the occasion, and thinking, 'This robber will not give me my life, but I'll take his life first by throwing him down the precipice in some way,' she spoke the two stanzas: Within my years of sense, within my conscious memory, No man on earth, I do protest, have I loved more than thee. Come hither, for my last salute, receive my last embrace: For never more upon the earth shall we meet face to face. Sattuka could not see her purpose, so he said, 'Very well, dear; come and embrace me.' Sulasa walked round him in respectful salutation three times, kissed him, and saying, 'Now, husband, I am going to make obeisance to you on all four sides,' she put her head on his foot, did obeisance at his sides, and went behind him as if to do obeisance there: then with the strength of an elephant she took him by the hinder parts and threw him head over heels down that place of destruction a hundred times as high as a man. He was crushed to pieces and died on the spot. Seeing this deed, the deity who lived on the mountain-top spoke these stanzas: Wisdom at times is not confined to men: A woman can shew wisdom now and then. Women are quick in counsel now and then. How quick and keen she was the way to know, She slew him like a deer with full-stretched bow. He that to great occasion fails to rise Falls, like that dull thief from the precipice. One prompt a crisis in his fate to see, Like her, is saved from threatening enemy. So Sulasa killed the robber. When she descended from the mountain and came among her attendants, they asked where her husband was. 'Don't ask me,' she said, and mounting her chariot she went on to the city.", "title": "Sulasa and Sattuka", "id": 372}
{"label": "510B", "text": "The king said to her, 'Are you like your name?' and she said, 'Yes.' She stopped there seven years. Her master gave her all the keys, even that of the treasure. One day, when the king and queen were out, Faithful goes to the fountain, and she sees seven robbers coming out of the house. Judge what a state this poor girl was in! She runs straight to the treasury, and sees that more than half the treasure is missing. She did not know what would become of her -- she was all of a tremble. When the king and queen came home she told them what had happened, but they would not believe her, and they put her in prison. She stays there a year. She kept saying that she was not in fault, but they would not believe her. The king condemns her to death, and sends her with four men to the forest to kill her, telling them to bring him her heart. They go off, but these men thought it a pity to kill this young girl, for she was very pretty, and she told them that she was innocent of this robbery; and they say to her, 'If you will not come any more into this land, we will spare your life.' She promises them that she will not be seen again in those parts. The men see an ass, and they tell her that they will carry its heart to the king. The young girl said to them, 'Flay this ass, I pray you; and, in order that no one may know me, I will never take this skin off me.' The men do so, and go off to the king, and the young girl goes to look for some shelter. At nightfall she finds a beautiful house. She asks if they want some one to keep the geese. They tell her, 'Yes, yes, yes.' They put her along with the geese, and tell her that she must go with them every day to such a field. She went out very early in the morning and came back late. It was the king's house, and it was the queen-mother and her son who lived there. After some time there appeared to her one day an old woman, who called to her, 'Faithful, you have done penance enough. The son of the king is going to give some grand feasts, and you must go to them. This evening you will ask madame permission, and you will tell her that you will give her all the news of the ball if she will let you go for a little while. And, see, here is a nut. All the dresses and things you want will come out of that. You will break it as you go to the place of the festival.' That evening she asked permission of her mistress to go and see the festival which the king is going to give, for a short time only, and that she will return directly and tell her all that she has seen there. Her mistress said, 'Yes.' That evening she goes then. On her way she breaks the nut, and there comes out of it a silver robe. She puts it on, and goes there, and immediately she enters all the world looks at her. The king is bewitched, he does not quit her for an instant, and they always dance together. He pays no attention at all to the other young ladies. They enjoy the refreshments very much. Some friends of the king call him, and he has to go there; and in this interval Faithful makes her escape to the house. She tells the queen how that a young girl had come to the ball, how she had dazzled everybody, and especially the king, who paid attention to her alone, but that she had escaped. When the son comes to the house, his mother says to him, 'She escaped from you then, your young lady? She did not care for you, doubtless.' He says to his mother, 'Who told you that?' 'Ass'-Skin; she wished to go and see it.' The king goes to where Faithful was and gives her two blows with his slipper, saying to her, 'If you return there again I will kill you on the spot.' The next day Ass'-Skin goes with her geese, and there appears to her again the old woman. She tells her that she ought to go to the ball again this evening -- that her mistress would give her permission. 'Here is a walnut; you have there all that is necessary to dress yourself with. The king will ask you your name: Braf-le-mandoufle [Beaten with the slipper].' In the evening she asks permission of her mistress, but she is astonished (at her asking), and says to her, 'You do not know what the king has said -- that if he catches you he will kill you on the spot?' 'I am not afraid. He will be sure not to catch me.' 'Go, then.' She goes off, and on the way she breaks the walnut, and there comes out of it a golden robe. She goes in. The king comes with a thousand compliments, and asks her how she had escaped the evening before without saying anything to him, and that he had been very much hurt at it. They amuse themselves thoroughly. The king has eyes for her alone. He asks her her name. She tells him, 'Braf-le-mandoufle.' They feast themselves well, and some friends having called to him he goes to them, and the young lady escapes. Ass'-Skin goes to tell the queen that yesterday evening's young lady had come, but still more beautiful -- that she had escaped in the very middle of the ball. She goes off to her geese. The king comes to his house. His mother says to him, 'She came then, the young lady you love? But she only loves you so-so, since she has gone off in this fashion.' 'Who told you that?' 'Ass'-Skin.' He goes off to her and gives her two kicks with his slipper, and says to her, 'Woe to you if you go there again; I will kill you on the very spot.' She goes off to her geese, and the old woman comes to her again and tells her to ask permission again for this evening -- that she must go to the dance. She gives her a peach, and tells her that she will have there all that is necessary to dress herself with. She goes then to ask her mistress if she will give her permission, like last night, to go to the ball. She says to her, 'Yes, yes, I will give you leave. But are you not afraid lest the king should catch you? He has said that he will kill you if you go there.' 'I am not afraid, because I am sure that he will not catch me. Yesterday he looked for me again, but he could not catch me.' She goes off then. On the way she opens her peach, and finds there a dress entirely of diamonds, and if she was beautiful before, judge what she is now! She shone like the sun. The king was plunged into joy when he saw her. He was in an ecstasy. He did not wish to dance, but they sat down at their ease on beautiful arm-chairs, and with their refreshments before them they passed such a long time together. The king asked her to give him her promise of marriage. The young lady gives him her word, and the king takes his diamond ring off his finger and gives it to her. His friends call him away to come quickly to see something very rare, and off he goes, leaving his lady. She takes advantage of this opportunity to escape. She tells her mistress all that has passed -- how that this young Lady had come with a dress of diamonds, that all the world was dazzled by her beauty, that they could not even look at her she shone so brightly, that the king did not know where he was for happiness, that they had given each other their promise of marriage, and that the king had given her his diamond ring, but that the best thing of all was that today again she has escaped him. The king comes in at that very instant. His mother says to him, 'She has not, she certainly has not, any wish for you. She has gone off with your diamond ring. Where will you go and look for her? You do not know where she lives. Where will you ask for a young lady who has such a name as 'Braf-le-mandoufle!' She has given you her promise of marriage too; but she does not wish to have you, since she has acted like that.' Our king did not even ask his mother who has told her that. He went straight to bed thoroughly ill, and so Ass'-Skin did not have her two kicks that evening. The queen was in great trouble at seeing her son ill like that. She was continually turning over in her head who this young lady might be. She said to her son, 'Is this young lady our Ass'-Skin ? How else could she have known that you had given your promise to one another, and that you had given her the ring too? She must have been very close to you. Did you see her?' He says, 'No,' but remains buried in thought. His mother says, 'She has a very pretty face under her ass'-skin.' And she says that she must send for her, and that he must have a good look at her too ; that he shall have some broth brought up by her. She sends for Ass'-Skin to the kitchen, has the broth made for her son, and Ass'-Skin puts in the middle of the bread the ring which the king had given her. The lady had her well dressed, and she goes to the king. The king, after having seen her, was still doubtful. He drank his broth; but when he puts the bread into his mouth he finds something (hard), and is very much astonished at seeing his ring. He was ill no longer. He goes and runs to his mother to tell her his joy that he has found his lady. He wishes to marry directly, and all the kings of the neighbourhood are invited to the feast; and, while they were dining, everyone had some fine news to relate. They ask the bride, too, if she had not something to tell them. She says, 'Yes,' but that she cannot tell what she knows that it would not please all at the table. Her husband tells her to speak out boldly; he draws his sword, and says, 'Whosoever shall speak a word shall be run through with this sword.' She then tells how a poor girl was servant at a king's house; how she remained there seven years; that they liked her very much, and treated her with confidence, even to giving her the keys of the treasure. One day, when the king and his wife were out, robbers entered, and stole almost all the treasure. The king would not believe that robbers had come. He puts the young girl in prison for a whole year, and at the end of that time he sends her to execution, telling the executioners to bring her heart to the house. The executioners were better than the king; they believed in her innocence, and, after having killed an ass, they carried its heart to the king; 'and for the proof, it is I who was servant to this king.' The bridegroom says to her, 'Who can this king be? Is it my uncle?' The lady says, ' I do not know if he is your uncle, but it is that gentleman there.' The bridegroom takes his sword and kills him on the spot, saying to his wife, 'You shall not be afraid of him any more.' They lived very happily. Some time afterwards they had two children, a boy and a girl. When the elder was seven years old he died, telling his father and mother that he was going to heaven to get a place there ready for them. At the end of a week the other child dies too, and she says to them that she, too, is going to heaven, and that she will keep their place ready; that they, too, would quickly go to them. And, as she had said, at the end of a year, at exactly the very same time, both the gentleman and lady died, and they both went to heaven.", "title": "Ass'-Skin (Webster)", "id": 373}
{"label": "613", "text": "Mountain and valley do not meet, but the children of men do, both good and bad. Thus a shoemaker and a tailor once met on their travels. The tailor was a handsome little fellow who was always cheerful and satisfied. He saw the shoemaker approaching him from the other side, and, observing from his bag what is trade was, he sang a mocking little song to him: Sew me the seam, Pull me the thread, Left and right, spread it with pitch, Pound, pound the nail on the head. The shoemaker, however, could not take a joke. He pulled a face as if he had drunk vinegar, and made a gesture as if he were about to seize the tailor by the collar. With that the little fellow began to laugh, offered him his bottle, saying, 'No harm was meant. Take a drink, and swallow your anger.' The shoemaker took a mighty drink, and the storm on his face began to clear away. He gave the bottle back to the tailor, and said, 'I took a hearty gulp. They have a lot to say about heavy drinking, but not much about great thirst. Shall we travel together?' 'All right,' answered the tailor, 'but only if only it suits you to go to a big town where there is no lack of work.' 'That is just where I wanted to go,' answered the shoemaker. 'In a small place there is nothing to be earned, and in the country people prefer to go barefoot.' Thus they traveled on together, always setting one foot before the other like a weasel in the snow. Both of them had time enough, but little to eat. When they reached a town they went about looking for work, and because the tailor looked so lively and merry, and had such fine red cheeks, every one gave him work willingly, and if he was lucky, the master's daughter gave him a kiss as well. Whenever he met up with the shoemaker, the tailor always had the most in his bundle. The ill-tempered shoemaker would make a sour face, thinking, 'The greater the rascal, the better the luck.' But the tailor would begin to laugh and to sing, and shared everything he had with his comrade. If a couple of pennies jingled in his pockets, he ordered drinks, then cheerfully thumped the table until the glasses danced. His motto was 'Easy come, easy go.' After they had traveled for some time, they came to a great forest through which passed the way to the capital. Two footpaths led through it, one of which was a seven days' journey and the other only two, but neither of them knew which way was the shorter one. They sat down beneath an oak tree and discussed together what preparations to make, and for how many days they should provide themselves with bread. The shoemaker said, 'One must plan ahead for the unexpected. I will take with me bread for a week.' 'What?' said the tailor. 'Haul bread for seven days on one's back like a beast of burden and not be able to look about? I shall trust in God, and not trouble myself about anything. The money I have in my pocket is as good in summer as in winter, but in hot weather bread dries out and gets moldy on top of that. Even my coat reaches only to my ankles. Why shouldn't we find the right way? Bread for two days, and that's enough.' Therefore each person bought his own bread, and then they tried their luck in the forest. It was as quiet there as in a church. No wind stirred, no brook murmured, no bird sang, and no sunbeam found its way through the thickly leaved branches. The shoemaker did not speak a word. The bread weighed so heavily on his back that the sweat streamed down his cross and gloomy face. The tailor, however, was quite merry. Walking on with a spring in each step, he whistled on a leaf, or sang a song, and thought to himself, 'God in heaven must be pleased that I am so happy.' This lasted two days, but on the third there was still no end to the forest, and the tailor had eaten up all his bread. Thus his heart sank down a yard deeper. Nevertheless, he did not lose courage, but relied on God and on his luck. On the evening of the third day he lay down hungry under a tree, and rose again the next morning still hungry. The fourth day was the same, and when the shoemaker seated himself on a fallen tree and devoured his dinner the tailor was only a spectator. If he begged for a little piece of bread, the other laughed mockingly, and said, 'You have always been so merry. Now you can see for once what it is like to be sad. Birds that sing too early in the morning are caught by the hawk in the evening.' In short, he was merciless. On the fifth morning the poor tailor could no longer stand up and was hardly able to utter one word for weakness. His cheeks were white, and his eyes were red. Then the shoemaker said to him, 'I will give you a bit of bread today, but in return for it, I will put out your right eye.' The unhappy tailor, who still wished to save his life, had to submit. He wept once more with both eyes, and then held them out, and the shoemaker, who had a heart of stone, put out his right eye with a sharp knife. The tailor remembered what his mother had once said to him when he had been snacking in the pantry: 'Eat whatever you can, and suffer whatever you must.' After eating his dearly bought bread, he got on his legs again, forgot his misery, and comforted himself with the thought that he could always see enough with one eye. But on the sixth day, hunger made itself felt again, almost consuming his heart. That evening he fell down by a tree, and on the seventh morning he was too weak to get up, and death was close at hand. Then the shoemaker said, 'I will show mercy and give you bread once more, but you shall not have it for nothing. I shall put out your other eye for it.' And now the tailor felt how careless his life had been, prayed to God for forgiveness, and said, 'Do what you will. I will bear what I must, but remember that our Lord God does not always look on passively, and that an hour will come when the evil deed which you have done to me, and which I have not deserved of you, will be requited. When times were good with me I shared what I had with you. My trade is such that one stitch must follow another. If I no longer have my eyes and can sew no more, I must go begging. At any rate do not leave me here alone when I am blind, or I shall die of hunger.' The shoemaker, however, who had driven God out of his heart, took the knife and put out his left eye. Then he gave him a bit of bread to eat, held out a stick to him, and led him on behind him. At sunset, they got out of the forest, and before them in an open field stood the gallows. The shoemaker led the blind tailor there, and then went on his way, leaving him there alone. Weariness, pain, and hunger made the wretched man fall asleep, and he slept the whole night. He awoke at dawn, not knowing where he was. Two poor sinners were hanging on the gallows, with a crow sat on the head of each of them. Then one of the men who had been hanged began to speak, and said, 'Brother, are you awake?' 'Yes, I am awake,' answered the second. 'Then I will tell you something,' said the first. 'The dew that this night has fallen down over us from the gallows gives everyone who washes himself with it his eyes again. If the blind knew this, how many would regain their sight who do not believe that to be possible?' Hearing this the tailor took his handkerchief, pressed it on the grass, and when it was moist with dew, washed the sockets of his eyes with it. Immediately what the man on the gallows had said came true, and a pair of healthy new eyes filled the sockets. It was not long before the tailor saw the sun rise from behind the mountains. In the plain before him lay the great royal city with its magnificent gates and hundred towers, and the golden balls and crosses on the spires began to shine. He could distinguish every leaf on the trees, saw the birds flying past, and the gnats dancing in the air. He took a needle out of his pocket, and as he could thread it as well as ever he had done, his heart danced with delight. He threw himself on his knees, thanked God for the mercy he had shown him, and said his morning prayer, not forgetting to pray for the poor sinners who were hanging there swinging against each other in the wind like the pendulums of clocks. Then he took his bundle on his back and soon forgot the sorrow he had endured, and went on his way singing and whistling. The first thing he came to was a brown foal freely running about the field. He caught it by the mane, and wanted to mount it and ride into the town. The foal, however, begged for its freedom. 'I am still too young,' it said. 'Even a light tailor such as you are would break my back in two. Let me go until I have grown strong. Perhaps a time may come when I can reward you for it.' 'Run off,' said the tailor. 'I see that you are still only a whippersnapper.' He gave it a touch on its back with a switch, whereupon it kicked up its hind legs for joy, jumped over hedges and ditches, and galloped away into the open country. The little tailor had eaten nothing since the day before. 'The sun fills my eyes,' he said, 'but bread does not fill my mouth. The first thing that comes my way and is even half edible will have to suffer for it.' In the meantime a stork stepped solemnly over the meadow towards him. 'Stop, stop,' cried the tailor, and seized him by the leg. 'I don't know if you are good to eat or not, but my hunger leaves me no great choice. I must cut your head off, and roast you.' 'Don't do that,' replied the stork. 'I am a sacred bird that brings mankind great profit, and no one harms me. If you spare my life I will be able do you good in some other way.' 'Then be off, cousin longlegs,' said the tailor. The stork rose up, let its long legs hang down, and flew gently away. 'What's to be the end of this?' said the tailor to himself at last. 'My hunger grows greater and greater, and my stomach more and more empty. Whatever comes in my way now is lost.' Then he saw a couple of young ducks which were on a pond come swimming towards him. 'You come just at the right moment,' said he, and laid hold of one of them and was about to wring its neck. With this an old duck which was hidden among the reeds, began to squawk loudly. She swam to him with open beak, begging him urgently to spare her dear children. 'Can you not imagine,' said she, 'how your mother would mourn if someone wanted to carry you off, and do an end to you.' 'Quiet down,' said the good-natured tailor. 'You shall keep your children,' and he set the captured one back into the water. When he turned around, he was standing in front of an old tree which was partly hollow, and saw some wild bees flying in and out of it. 'There I shall find the reward of my good deed,' said the tailor. 'The honey will refresh me.' But the queen bee came out and threatened him, saying, 'If you touch my people and destroy my nest our stings shall pierce your skin like ten thousand red-hot needles. But if you leave us in peace and go your way we will do you a service for it another time.' The little tailor saw that here also nothing was to be done. Three dishes empty and nothing on the fourth is a bad dinner. He dragged himself therefore with his starved-out stomach into the town, and as it was just striking twelve, all was ready-cooked for him in the inn, and he was able to sit down at once to dinner. When he was satisfied he said, 'Now I will get to work.' He went around the town, sought a master, and soon found a good situation. Because he already had thoroughly learned his trade, it was not long before he became famous, and everyone wanted to have a new coat made by the little tailor. His reputation grew day by day. 'I can go no further in skill,' said he, 'and yet things improve every day.' At last the king appointed him court tailor. But strange things do happen in the world. On that very same day his former comrade the shoemaker also became court shoemaker. When the latter caught sight of the tailor, and saw that he once more had two healthy eyes, his conscience troubled him. 'Before he takes revenge on me,' he thought to himself, 'I must dig a pit for him.' He, however, who digs a pit for another, falls into it himself. In the evening when work was over and it was growing dark, he sneaked to the king and said, 'Your majesty, the tailor is an arrogant fellow and has boasted that he will get the golden crown back again that was lost ages ago.' 'That would please me,' said the king, and the next morning he had the tailor brought before him, and ordered him to get the crown back again, or to leave the city forever. 'Aha,' thought the tailor. 'A rogue gives more than he has. If the bad-tempered king wants me to do what no one else can do, I will not wait until morning, but will leave town at once.' Therefore he tied up his bundle, but once outside the gate he could not help being sorry to give up his good fortune and turn his back on the city in which all had gone so well for him. He came to the pond where he had made the acquaintance of the ducks. At that very moment the old one whose young ones he had spared was sitting there by the shore, preening herself with her beak. She knew him again instantly, and asked why he was hanging his head so. 'You will not be surprised when you hear what has happened to me,' replied the tailor, and told her his fate. 'If that is all,' said the duck, 'we can help you. The crown fell into the water, and it lies down below at the bottom. We will soon bring it up again for you. In the meantime just spread out your handkerchief on the bank.' She dived down with her twelve young ones, and in five minutes she was up again with the crown resting on her wings. The twelve young ones were swimming round about with their beaks under it, helping to carry it. They swam to the shore and put the crown on the handkerchief. No one can imagine how magnificent the crown was. When the sun shone on it, it gleamed like a hundred thousand carbuncles. The tailor tied his handkerchief together by the four corners and carried it to the king, who was full of joy, and hung a gold chain around the tailor's neck. When the shoemaker saw that the one trick had failed, he contrived a second, and went to the king and said, 'Your majesty, the tailor has become insolent again. He boasts that he can copy in wax the whole of the royal palace, with everything that pertains to it, movable or immovable, inside and out.' The king sent for the tailor and ordered him to copy in wax the whole of the royal palace, with everything that pertained to it, movable or immovable, inside and out. And failing this, or if so much as one nail on the wall were missing, he should be imprisoned underground for the rest of his life. The tailor thought, 'It gets worse and worse. No one can endure this,' and he threw his bundle on his back, and went forth. When he came to the hollow tree, he sat down and hung his head. The bees came flying out, and the queen bee asked him if he had a stiff neck, since he hung his head so. 'Oh no,' answered the tailor, 'something quite different weighs me down,' and he told her what the king had demanded of him. The bees began to buzz and hum amongst themselves, and the queen bee said, 'Just go home again, but come back tomorrow at this time, and bring a large cloth with you, and then all will be well.' So he turned back again, but the bees flew to the royal palace and straight into it through the open windows, crept into every corner, and inspected everything most carefully. Then they hurried back and modeled the palace in wax so quickly that anyone looking on would have thought it was growing before his eyes. By the evening all was ready, and when the tailor came the next morning, the whole splendid building was there, and not one nail in the wall or tile on the roof was missing. And at the same time it was delicate and white as snow, and smelled sweet as honey. The tailor wrapped it carefully in his cloth and took it to the king, who could not admire it enough, placed it in his largest hall, and in return for it presented the tailor with a large stone house. The shoemaker, however, did not give up, but went for the third time to the king and said, 'Your majesty, the tailor has heard that no water will spring up in the castle's courtyard, but he has boasted that he can create a fountain in the middle of the courtyard as tall as a man and as clear as crystal.' Then the king ordered the tailor to be brought before him and said, 'If a stream of water does not rise in my courtyard by tomorrow as you have promised, in that very place the executioner shall make you shorter by a head.' The poor tailor did not take long to think about it, but hurried out to the gate, and because this time it was a matter of life and death to him, tears rolled down his face. While he was thus sorrowfully going forth, the foal to which he had formerly given its liberty, and which had now become a beautiful chestnut horse, came leaping towards him. 'The time has come,' it said to the tailor, 'when I can repay you for your good deed. I already know what you need, and you shall soon have help. Climb on; my back can carry two of you.' The tailor's courage came back to him. He jumped up in one bound, and the horse went full speed into the city, and immediately to the castle's courtyard. It galloped as quick as lightning three times around it, the third time falling down. At that instant there was a terrific clap of thunder, a fragment of earth in the middle of the courtyard sprang like a cannonball into the air and over the castle. Directly afterward a jet of water rose as high as a man on horseback, and the water was as pure as crystal, and the sunbeams began to dance on it. When the king saw this he arose in amazement, and went and embraced the tailor in the sight of all men. But good fortune did not last long. The king had daughters aplenty, each one more beautiful than the others, but he had no son. So the malicious shoemaker went to the king a fourth time, and said, 'Your majesty, the tailor has not given up his arrogance. He has now boasted that if he liked, he could cause a son to be brought to his majesty through the air.' The king summoned the tailor and said, 'If you cause a son to be brought to me within nine days, you shall have my eldest daughter to wife.' 'The reward is indeed great,' thought the little tailor. 'One would willingly do something for it, but the cherries grow too high for me. If I climb for them, the branch will break beneath me, and I shall fall.' He went home, seated himself cross-legged on his worktable, and thought over what was to be done. 'It can't be managed,' he cried at last. 'I will go away after all. I cannot live in peace here.' He tied up his bundle and hurried away to the gate. When he got to the meadow, he perceived his old friend the stork, who was walking backwards and forwards like a philosopher. Sometimes he stood still, looking closely at a frog, than finally swallowing it down. The stork came to him and greeted him. 'I see,' he began, 'that you have your pack on your back. Why are you leaving town?' The tailor told him what the king had required of him, and how he could not perform it, and lamented his misfortune. 'Don't let that turn your hair gray,' said the stork, 'I will help you out of your difficulty. For a long time now, I have been carrying infant children into the city, so this time, I can fetch a little prince out of the well. Go home and take it easy. Nine days from now go to the royal palace, and I will arrive there as well.' The little tailor went home, and at the appointed time was at the castle. Not long afterward the stork flew up and tapped at the window. The tailor opened it, and cousin longlegs came in carefully and walked with solemn steps over the smooth marble pavement. In his beak he had a baby that was as lovely as an angel, and who stretched out his little hands to the queen. The stork laid him in her lap, and she caressed him and kissed him, and was beside herself with delight. Before flying away, the stork took his traveling bag off his back and handed it to the queen. In it there were little paper parcels with colored sweets, and they were divided amongst the little princesses. The eldest, however, received none of them, but instead got the merry tailor for a husband. 'It seems to me,' he said, 'that I have won the highest prize. My mother was right after all. She always said that whoever trusts in God and has only good luck can never fail.' The shoemaker had to make the shoes in which the little tailor danced at the wedding festival, after which he was commanded to quit the town for ever. The road to the forest led him to the gallows. Worn out with anger, rage, and the heat of the day, he threw himself down. When he had closed his eyes and was about to sleep, the two crows flew down from the heads of the men who were hanging there and pecked his eyes out. In his madness he ran into the forest and must have died there of hunger, for no one has seen him or heard of him again. und Hausm\u00c3\u00a4rchen, no. 107.", "title": "The Two Travelers", "id": 374}
{"label": "332", "text": "There was once a poor man whose wife had just given birth to a son. He wanted his child to have a just man as godfather, and he set out to find him. As he was walking, his stick in his hand, he first met a stranger, who looked like an honest man, and who asked him: 'Where are you going, my good man?' -- I'm looking for a godfather for my new son. -- Well! Do you want me? I am at your disposal, if you please. -- Yes, but... I want a just man. -- Well! you could not have timed better; I am your man. -- So who are you?' -- I am the good Lord. -- You just? Lord God!... No! No! Everywhere on earth I hear people complaining about you. -- Why ist that, if you please? -- Why? For a thousand and a thousand different reasons.... Some complain because you sent them to this world weak, disabled, or sickly, while others are strong and full of health, but are not more deserving than the sickly ones. Furthermore, there are very honest people, I know more than one, who work like dogs continually, but you leave them poor and miserable, while their wasteful, heartless, good-for-nothing neighbors.... No, hold on, you won't be my son's godfather. Goodbye!... And the fellow went on his way, grumbling. A little further on he met a tall old man with a long white beard. 'Where are you going, my good man?' asked the old man. -- Looking for a godfather for my newborn son. -- I'm quite willing to act as his godfather, if you like. Would that suit you? -- Yes, but I must tell you first that I want my son's godfather to be a just man. -- A just man? Well I am, I think. -- So who are you? -- Saint Peter. -- The gatekeeper of paradise, the one who holds the keys? -- Yes, that very one. -- Well! But you're not just either. -- 'I am not just? Me!' replied Saint Peter with ill humor. 'And, my good man, please tell me why not. -- Why not? Ah! I will tell you: I have been told that you refuse your door to honest people, hard-working men like myself for petty offences. And why? Because, after working hard all week, they may drink a pint too much of cider on Sundays,... and then, need I say any more? You are the prince of the apostles, the head of the Church, are you not? Saint Peter nodded, in agreement. -- Well, in your church it's like everywhere else: Nothing there is more important than money. The rich come before the poor like everywhere else.... No, you won't be my son's godfather either. Goodbye!... And he went on his way, still grumbling. He then met an unpleasant-looking fellow. He was carrying a large scythe over his shoulder, like a reaper going to his work. -- Where are you going, my good man?' the stranger asked him. -- To find a godfather for my newborn son. -- Do you want me as your godfather? -- First I must tell you that I want a just man. -- A just man! You will never find anyone more just than I am. -- Everyone tells me that. But who are you? -- I am Death. -- Ah, yes! You are really just. You have no preference for anyone, and you do your job honestly. Rich and poor, noble and common, king and subject, young and old, weak and strong.... You take them all when their time has come. You do not let yourself be softened or weakened by tears, threats, prayers, or gold. Yes, you are truly just, and you will be my son's godfather. Come with me. And the man returned to his cottage, taking with him the godfather he had chosen for his son. Death held the infant at the baptismal font, and afterwards there was a little meal in the poor man's cottage, where they drank cider and ate white bread, unlike their everyday fare. Before leaving, the godfather said to his friend: 'You are very good people, your wife and you; but you are very poor! As you have chosen me to be the godfather of your son, I want to express my gratitude to you by revealing a secret that will make you earn a lot of money. You, friend, you are going to become a doctor now, and this is how you should behave: When you are called to a sick person, if you see me at the head of the bed, you can affirm that you will cure him, and give him anything as a remedy, even plain water. If you do so, he will always recover. If, to the contrary, you see me with my scythe at the foot of the bed, there will be nothing you can do. The patient will surely die, whatever you do to try to save him. Here, then, is our fake medical doctor, putting into practice the system of his friend Death, and predicting, always with certainty, when his patients will recover or die. Because he was never mistaken, and, moreover, because the remedies did not cost him dearly, since he only gave plain water to his patients, whatever the disease, he was highly sought after and soon became rich. However, Death, when he had occasion to pass by, came in from time to time to see his godson and talk with his friend. The child grew and developed wonderfully, but the doctor, to the contrary, grew older and weaker every day. One day Death said to him: 'I always come to see you when I pass by here, but you've not yet come to my house. You must come and visit me, so that I can in turn be your host and show you my home.' 'I'm in no hurry to visit you,' replied the doctor, 'because I know that once someone is at your place, comrade, they don't come back the way they want to.' -- Don't worry about that. I won't detain you until your time has come. You know that I am the most just of all men. So the doctor left one night to visit his friend. They went overland for a long time: over hill and dale, crossing arid plains, forests, rivers, rivers, and regions completely unknown to the doctor. Finally, Death stopped in front of an old castle surrounded by high walls, in the middle of a dark forest, and said to his companion: 'It is here.' They entered. The master of the gloomy manor first entertained his guest magnificently, then, on leaving the table, he led him into an immense room where millions of candles of all sizes were burning: long, medium, and short. They burned more or less steadily, and cast light more or less clearly. Our man was at first astonished, dazzled, and speechless before this spectacle. Then, when he could speak: 'What do all these lights mean, my friend?' he asked. -- These are the lights of life, my friend. -- The lights of life? What do they mean? -- All humans who now live on earth have candles there, to which their lives are attached. -- But there are long ones, medium ones, short ones, bright ones, dull ones, dying ones... Why? -- Yes, it's like all human lives: some are just beginning; others are in their prime with all their brilliance; others are weak and wavering; others finally are about to die out.... -- Why is this one so long and tall? -- It is that of a child who has just been born. -- And this other one, how brilliant and beautiful this light is! -- It is that of someone in the prime of life. -- Here's one that's going to die out for want of wax. -- He is an old man who is dying. -- And mine, where is it? I would like to see it. -- Here it is, near you. -- That one? Ah! My God, it is almost completely consumed! It will go out! -- Yes, you only have three more days to live! -- What are you saying? What, only three days!... But since I am your friend, and you are the master here, could you not make my candle last a little longer -- for example, by taking a little from that long one and adding it to mine?... -- The long one is your son's, and if I did as you are asking, I would no longer be the just person you were looking for. 'That is true,' replied the doctor, calming himself and heaving a deep sigh.... And he then returned home, put his affairs in order, called the priest of his parish, and died three days later -- just as his friend Death had predicted. Told by J.

{"label": "20C", "text": "One night while the little boy was sitting in Uncle Remus's cabin, waiting for the old man to finish his hoe-cake, and refresh his memory as to the further adventures of Brother Rabbit, his friends and his enemies, something dropped upon the top of the house with a noise like the crack of a pistol. The little boy jumped, but Uncle Remus looked up and exclaimed, 'Ah-yi!' in a tone of triumph. 'What was that, Uncle Remus?' the child asked, after waiting a moment to see what else would happen. 'New from Jack Frost, honey. When that hickory-nut tree out there hears him coming, she begins to drop what she's got. I'm mighty glad,' he continued, scraping the burnt crust from hi hoe-cake with an old case-knife. 'I'm mighty glad hickory nuts aren't as big and heavy as grindstones.' He waited a moment to see what effect this queer statement would have on the child. 'Yes, sir, I'm might glad, that I am. Because if hickory nuts were as big as grindstones, this here old calaboose would be leaking long before Christmas.' Just then another hickory nut dropped upon the roof, and the little boy jumped again. This seemed to amuse Uncle Remus, and he laughed until he was near to choking himself with his smoking hoe-cake. 'You are doing exactly what old Brer Rabbit did, I declare to gracious if you aren't,' the old man cried, as soon as he could get his breath. 'Exactly for the world.' The child was immensely flattered, and at once he wanted to know how Brother Rabbit did. Uncle Remus was in such good humor that he needed no coaxing. He pushed his spectacles back on he forehead, wiped him mouth on his sleeve, and began: It came about that early one morning towards the fall of the year Brer Rabbit was stirring around in the woods after some bergamot to use for making him some hair grease. The wind was blowing so cold that it made him feel right frisky, and every time he heard the bushes rattle, it seemed to scare him. He was going on this way, hoppity-skippity, when by and by he heard Mr. Man cutting on a tree way off in the woods. He sat up, Brer Rabbit did, and listened first with one ear and then with the other. The man, he cut and cut, and Brer Rabbit, he listened and listened. By and by, while all this was going on, down came the tree: kubber-lang-bang-blam! Brer Rabbit, he took and jumped just like you jumped, and not only that, he made a break, he did, and he leaped out of as though the dogs were after him. 'Was he scared, Uncle Remus?' asked the little boy. 'Scared! Who? Him? Shoo! Don't you fret yourself about Brer Rabbit, honey. In those days there was nothing going that could scare Brer Rabbit. To be sure, he took care of himself, and if you know anyone who refuses to take care of himself, I would mighty well like you to point him out. Indeed I would!' Uncle Remus seemed to boil over wit argumentative indignation. Well then, he continued, Brer Rabbit ran until he sort of got heated up, and about the time he was getting ready to squat and catch his wind, who should he meet but Brer Coon going home after sitting up with old Brer Bull-Frog. Brer Coon saw him running, and he hailed him, 'What's your hurry, Brer Rabbit?' 'Haven't got time to tarry.' 'Folks sick?' 'No, my Lord! Haven't got time to tarry!' 'Trying out your suppleness?' 'No, my Lord! Haven't got time to tarry!' 'Do pray, Brer Rabbit, tell me the news!' 'Mighty big fuss back there in the woods. Haven't got time to tarry!' This made Brer Coon feel might skittish, because he was far from home, and he just leaped out, he did, and he went a-boiling through the woods. Brer Coon hadn't gone far until he met Brer Fox. 'Hey, Brer Coon, where are you going?' 'Haven't got time to tarry!' 'Going to the doctor?' 'No, my Lord! Haven't got time to tarry!' Do pry, Brer Coon, tell me the news.' Mighty queer racket back there in the woods! Haven't got time to tarry! With that, Brer Fox leaped out, he did, and fairly split the wind. He hadn't gone far until he met Brer Wolf. 'Hey, Brer Fox! Stop and rest yourself!' 'Haven't got time to tarry!' 'Who is wanting the doctor?' 'No one, my Lord! Haven't got time to tarry.' 'Do pray, Brer Fox, good or bad, tell me the news.' 'Mighty curious fuss back there in the woods! Haven't got time to tarry!' With that, Brer Wolf shook himself loose from the face of the earth, and he didn't get far until he met Brer Bear. Brer Bear, he asked, and Brer Wolf made an answer, and by and by Brer Bear snorted and ran off. And, bless gracious, it wasn't long before the last one of the creatures was a-skaddling through the woods as though the Old Boy were after them, and all because Brer Rabbit heard Mr. Man cut a tree down. They ran and they ran, Uncle Remus went on, until they them to Brer Terrapin's house, and they sort of slacked up, because they had nearly lost their wind. Brer Terrapin, he up an asked them where they were going, and they said there was a monstrous, terrifying racket back there in the woods. Brer Terrapin, he asked what it sounded like. One said he didn't know; the other said he didn't know; and they all said they didn't know. This made old Brer Terrapin laugh way down in his insides, and he up and said, 'You all can run along if you feel skittish,' he said. 'After I cook my breakfast and wash up the dishes, and if I get wind of any suspicious racket, maybe I might just take down my parasol and follow along after you,' he said. When the creatures came to ask one another about who started the news, it went right back to Brer Rabbit, but low and behold, Brer Rabbit wasn't there! It turned out that Brer Coon was the one who had seen him last. Then they got to laying the blame of it on one or the other, until they almost began to fight, but then old Brer Terrapin, he up and said that if they wanted to straighten it out, they'd better go see Brer Rabbit. All the creatures agreed, the they started out for Brer Rabbit's house. When they got there, Brer Rabbit was sitting cross-legged on the front porch winking his eyes at the sun. Brer Bear spoke up, 'What made you fool me, Brer Rabbit?' 'Fool who, Brer Bear?' 'Me, Brer Rabbit, that's who.' 'This is the first time I've seen you today, Brer Bear, and you are more than welcome at that.' They all asked him and got the same answer, and then Brer Coon put in, 'What made you fool me, Brer Rabbit?' 'How did I fool you, Brer Coon?' 'You made like there was a big racket, Brer Rabbit.' 'What kind of a racket, Brer Rabbit?' 'Ah-yi! You should have asked me that first, Brer Coon.' 'I'm asking you now, Brer Rabbit.' 'Mr. Man cut a tree down, Brer Coon.' Of course this made Brer Coon feel like a natural-born slink, and it wasn't long before all the creatures made their bows to Brer Rabbit and moseyed off home. 'Brother Rabbit had the best of it all along,' said the little boy, after waiting to see whether there was a sequel to the story. 'Oh, did he ever!' exclaimed Uncle Remus. 'Brer Rabbit was a mighty man in those days.'", "title": "Brother Rabbit Takes Some Exercise (Harris)", "id": 380}
{"label": "332", "text": "She took him with her to her apartment, which was very handsomely furnished. Afterwards she conducted him into great vaults, and through these vaults they went right into the underworld in the dark. There tapers were burning of three sizes -- small, large, and middle-sized; and those which were not yet alight were very large. The godmother said to the godchild's father: 'Look, Gossip, here I have the duration of everybody's life.' The child's father gazed thereat, found there a tiny taper close to the very ground, and asked her: 'But, Gossip, I pray you, whose is this little taper close to the ground?' She said to him: 'That is yours! When any taper whatsoever burns down, I must go for that man.' He said to her: 'Gossip, I pray you, give me somewhat additional.' She said to him: 'Gossip, I cannot do that!' Afterwards she went and lighted a large new taper for the baby boy whom they had had christened. Meanwhile, while the godmother was not looking, the child's father took for himself a large new taper, lit it, and placed it where his tiny taper was burning down. The godmother looked round at him and said: 'Gossip, you ought not to have done that to me; but if you have given yourself additional lifetime, you have done so and possess it. Let us go hence, and we'll go to your wife.' She took a present, and went with the child's father and the child to the mother. She arrived, and placed the boy on his mother's bed, and asked her how she was, and whether she had any pain anywhere. The mother confided her griefs to her, and the father sent for some beer, and wanted to entertain her in his cottage, as godmother, in order to gratify her and show his gratitude. They drank and feasted together. Afterwards the godmother said to her godchild's father: 'Gossip, you are so poor that no one but myself would be at your service in this matter; but never mind, you shall bear me in memory! I will go to the houses of various respectable people and make them ill, and you shall physic and cure them. I will tell you all the remedies. I possess them all, and everybody will be glad to recompense you well, only observe this: When I stand at anyone's feet, you can be of assistance to every such person; but if I stand at anybody's head, don't attempt to aid him.' It came to pass. The child's father went from patient to patient, where the godmother caused illness, and benefited every one. All at once he became a distinguished physician. A prince was dying -- nay, he had breathed his last -- nevertheless, they sent for the physician. He came, he began to anoint him with salves and give him his powders, and did him good. When he had restored him to health, they paid him well, without asking how much they were indebted. Again, a count was dying. They sent for the physician again. The physician came. Death was standing behind the bed at his head. The physician cried: 'It's a bad case, but we'll have a try.' He summoned the servants, and ordered them to turn the bed round with the patient's feet towards Death, and began to anoint him with salves and administer powders into his mouth, and did him good. The count paid him in return as much as he could carry away, without ever asking how much he was indebted; he was only too glad that he had restored him to health. When Death met the physician, she said to him: 'Gossip, if this occurs to you again, don't play me that trick any more. True, you have done him good, but only for a while; I must, none the less, take him off whither he is due.' The child's father went on in this way for some years; he was now very old. But at last he was wearied out, and asked Death herself to take him. Death was unable to take shim, because he had given himself a long additional taper; she was obliged to wait till it burned out. One day he drove to a certain patient to restore him to health, and did so. Afterwards Death revealed herself to him, and rode with him in his carriage. She began to tickle and play with him, and tap him with a green twig under the throat; he threw himself into her lap, and went off into the last sleep. Death laid him in the carriage, and took herself off. They found the physician lying dead in his carriage, and conveyed him home. The whole town and all the villages lamented: 'That physician is much to be regretted. What a good doctor he was! He was of great assistance; there will never be his like again!' His son remained after him, but had not the same skill. The son went one day into church, and his godmother met him. She asked him: 'My dear son, how are you?' He said to her: 'Not all alike; so long as I have what my dad saved up for me, it is well with me, but after that the Lord God knows how it will be with me.' His godmother said: 'Well, my son, fear nought. I am your christening mamma; I helped your father to what he had, and will give you, too, a livelihood. You shall go to a physician as a pupil, and you shall be more skilful than he, only behave nicely.' After this she anointed him with salve over the ears, and conducted him to a physician. The physician didn't know what manner of lady it was, and what sort of son she brought him for instruction. The lady enjoined her son to behave nicely, and requested the physician to instruct him well, and bring him into a good position. Then she took leave of him and departed. The physician and the lad went together to gather herbs, and each herb cried out to the pupil what remedial virtue it had, and the pupil gathered it. The physician also gathered herbs, but knew not, with regard to any herb, what remedial virtue it possessed. The pupil's herbs were beneficial in every disease. The physician said to the pupil: 'You are cleverer than I, for I diagnose no one that comes to me; but you know herbs counter to every disease. Do you know what? Let us join partnership. I will give my doctor's diploma up to you, and will be your assistant, and am willing to be with you till death.' The lad was successful in doctoring and curing till his taper burned out in limbo.", "title": "Gossip", "id": 381}
{"label": "545B", "text": "There was once a peasant, who with his wife lived very, very far in the woods. They had two children, a boy and a girl. They were very poor, all their wealth consisting in a cow and a cat. This peasant and his wife lived in a state of constant strife with each other, and you might have been sure, that if the old man desired one thing, the old woman always desired another. It happened one day that the old woman had boiled some porridge for supper, and when it was ready, and each had received a share, the old man would scrape the pot. This the old woman opposed with all her might, asserting that the right of scraping belonged to her, and her only. Hence a desperate quarrel ensued, neither being willing to yield to the other. The end was, that the old woman snatched up the pot and the ladle and ran off, the old man with a whip following close at her heels. And away they went over hill and dale, the old woman first, and the old man close behind her; but our history does not inform us which of the two finally obtained the scraping of the pot. When a considerable time had elapsed, and no tidings were heard of their parents, the children had no alternative but to go out into the wide world and seek their fortune. So they resolved on leaving their habitation, and dividing their inheritance. But, as it generally happens, the division was a mighty difficult affair; there being nothing to divide save the cow and the cat, and both being desirous of having the cow. While they were discussing the point, the cat, with a most insinuating mien, approaching the sister, gently rubbed her knee, and mewed: 'Take me, take me.' So, as the boy would not let go the cow, the girl gave up her pretension and contented herself with the cat. They then parted from each other, the boy with the cow going his way, and the girl with her cat wandering through the wood; but of her and her companion's adventures nothing has been related to me, until they came to a spacious and splendid palace, which lay at some distance before them. While both travelers were on their way to the beautiful palace, the cat began to converse with his mistress, and said: 'If you will follow my advice, it shall bring you luck.' The girl, who placed great confidence in her companion's prudence, promised to follow his directions. The cat thereupon desired her to take off her old garments, and climb up into a high tree, while he would go to the palace and say, that there was a princess, who had been attacked by robbers and stripped both of property and clothes. The girl did accordingly, threw off her old rags and placed herself in the tree. The cat then went; but the girl sat in a great fright, as to how the matter would turn out. When the king, who ruled the land, was informed that a foreign princess had suffered such violence, he was exceedingly troubled, and sent his servants to invite her to the palace. The young girl was now abundantly supplied with costly attire, and whatever else she required, and accompanied the royal messengers. On arriving at the palace, all were struck with her beauty and courteous manners; but the king's son paid her the most marked homage, and declared that he could not live without her. The queen, however, had her suspicions, and asked the beautiful princess where her residence was. The girl answered as she had been instructed by the cat: 'I dwell very far from here, in a castle called Cattenburg.' Still the old queen was not satisfied, but resolved with herself to ascertain whether the strange damsel were really a king's daughter or not. For this purpose she went to the guest-chamber, and made ready a bed for the peasant girl with soft silken bolsters, but laid secretly a bean under the sheet; 'Because,' thought she, ' if she is a princess, she cannot fail to notice it.' The young girl was then conducted to her apartment with great state. But the cat had observed the queen's stratagem, and apprized his mistress of it. In the morning, the old queen entered, and inquired how her guest had passed the night. The girl answered as the cat had instructed her: 'All, yes, I have slept, for I was very weary after my journey; but it seemed as if I had a large mountain under me. I slept much better in my bed at Cattenburg.' The queen now thought that the damsel must have been delicately bred; yet resolved on making one more trial. On the following evening the queen went again to the guest-chamber, and having prepared the peasant girl's bed as before, laid some peas under the first pillow; and when it was morning, entered and inquired of her guest how she had slept. But, following the cat's instructions, she answered: 'Ah, yes, I have slept, for I was very tired; but it seemed as if I had large stones under me. I slept much better in my bed at Cattenburg.' The old queen now thought that she had well stood the trial, yet could not entirely dismiss her suspicions, and therefore determined on a third attempt, for the purpose of finding out whether the strange damsel really were of such high birth as she pretended to be. When the third evening came, the queen went again to the guest-chamber, and, having prepared the bed as before, laid a straw under the second pillow; and when the queen came in the morning and inquired how she had slept, she again answered as the cat had instructed: 'Ah, yes, I have slept; for I was very tired; but it seemed as if I had a large tree under me. I was much better served at Cattenburg.' The queen now found that there was no sure way of arriving at the truth in this manner, and therefore resolved on keeping watch how the strange damsel conducted herself in other respects. On the following day the queen sent to her guest a costly dress, embroidered with silk, and with a very, very long train, such as were worn by women of high rank. The peasant girl thanked her for the present, and thought no more about it; but the cat, that was close at her elbow, apprized his mistress that the old queen would put her to another trial. When some time had passed, the queen sent to inquire whether the princess would accompany her on a walk. The peasant girl consented, and they set out. On entering a garden, the court ladies were very fearful lest they should soil their dresses, as it had rained during the night. But the strange damsel continued walking, with out heeding whether her long train was being dragged through the mud or not. Whereupon the queen said: 'My dear princess, take care of your dress.' To which the peasant girl proudly answered: 'Oh, there must be more dresses to be had here besides this. I had much better when I was in my castle at Cattenburg.' Now the old queen could not think otherwise than that the damsel was accustomed to wear silk-embroidered garments, and thence concluded that she must be a king's daughter; so could no longer entertain any objection to her son's marriage, to which the peasant girl also gave her consent. It happened one day, as the prince and his beloved were sitting conversing together, that the damsel, on looking through the window, saw her parents come running out of the wood, the old woman first with the pot, and the old man close at her heels with the ladle. At the sight the girl could not contain herself, but burst out into a loud laugh. On the prince inquiring why she laughed so heartily, she said, as the cat had instructed her: 'I cannot help laughing when I think that your palace stands on stone pillars, while mine stands on golden ones.' When the prince heard this he was greatly surprised, and said: 'Your thoughts are always dwelling on the beautiful Cattenburg, and you seem to think that all things are better there than with us. We will go and see your splendid palace, let the distance be ever so great.' At this the peasant's daughter was so alarmed that she would willingly have sunk into the earth, knowing well that she had not a house, much less a palace. But there being no remedy, she put a good face on the matter, saying that she would consider on what day they should commence their journey. When she found herself alone, she gave free vent to her trouble, and wept bitterly; for she thought of all the disgrace that would fall on her for her deceit and falsehood. While she thus sat and wept, in walked the sagacious cat, rubbed himself against her knee, and inquired the cause of her sorrow. 'I may well be sorrowful,' answered the peasant's daughter; 'for the king's son says that we shall go to Cattenburg; so now I am like to pay dearly for having followed thy counsel.' But the cat bade her be of good cheer, and added, that he would so manage matters, that everything should turn out better than she could imagine; at the same time telling her that the sooner they set out the better. Having had already so many proofs of the cat's wisdom, she followed his instructions, though this time with a heavy heart; for she could not free herself from the apprehension that their journey would have an unfortunate termination. Early on the following morning, the king's son ordered chariots and drivers, and everything besides which he thought necessary for their long journey to Cattenburg. The train then set out. The prince and his betrothed went first in a gilded chariot, attended by a numerous body of knights and squires; while the cat ran foremost of all to show them the way. After travelling for some time, the cat perceived some goatherds driving to the field a large flock of most beautiful goats; so going up to the men, he greeted them courteously, saying: 'Good day, goatherds! When the king's son rides by and inquires to whom those fine goats belong, you must say they belong to the young princess at Cattenburg, who rides by the prince's side. If you do so, you shall be well rewarded; but if not, I will tear you in pieces.' On hearing this the goatherds were much surprised, but promised to obey the cat's bidding. He then pursued his way. Shortly after came the king's son riding with all his train. On seeing such beautiful goats feeding in the field, he stopped his chariot, and inquired of the herdsmen to whom they belonged. They answered, as the cat had instructed them: 'They belong to the young princess at Cattenburg, who rides by your side.' At this the king's son wondered greatly, and thought that his betrothed must be a powerful princess; and the peasant girl was not a little glad at heart, and thought that she was not the losing party, when she divided the inheritance with her brother. They now continued their journey, the cat running foremost. After travelling for some time they came to where a number of persons were making hay in a pleasant field. These the cat saluted very courteously, saying as before: 'Good day, good people! When the king's son comes by and inquires to whom this beautiful meadow belongs, you must answer that it belongs to the princess at Cattenburg, who rides by the prince's side. If you do so, you shall be well rewarded; but if you do not do as I have said, I will tear you to atoms.' When the men heard this they were greatly surprised, and promised to say what the cat desired. The cat then ran on as before. Shortly after came the king's son in his chariot with his whole retinue. On seeing the fertile fields and the number of people, he caused his chariot to stop, and inquired who was the owner of the land. The men, following the cat's instructions, answered: 'The fields belong to the young princess at Cattenburg, who rides by your side.' The king's son was now yet more surprised, and thought that his bride must be immensely rich, seeing that she owned such beautiful hay-fields. Resuming their journey, and preceded by the cat, they approached at length a very extensive corn-field, which swarmed with men and women, all busily employed in reaping. Here the cat again ran forth, enjoining and threatening as on the former occasions; so that when the prince came by and inquired to whom the fields belonged, he received an answer similar to the foregoing. It was now late in the evening, and the prince stopped with his attendants for the purpose of resting during the night. But the cat took no rest, but ran hastily forwards, until he saw a beautiful castle with its towers and battlements, and supported by golden pillars. This splendid palace belonged to a fierce giant, who owned the entire neighboring country; but was at that time absent from home. The cat therefore passed through the castle gate, and transformed himself into a large loaf; then stationed himself in the key-hole, and awaited the giant's return. Early in the morning, before the dawn, the frightful giant, who was so huge and heavy that the earth shook under him as he walked, came jogging out of the forest. When he came to the castle gate, he could not open it, because of the great loaf that stuck in the key-hole. Thereupon he became exceedingly angry, and cried: ' Unlock! unlock!' To which the cat answered: 'Just wait a little, little moment, while I tell my story: 'First they kneaded me as if they would knead me to death.' 'Unlock! unlock!' cried the giant again; but the cat answered as before: 'Just wait a little, little moment, while I tell my story: 'First they kneaded me as if they would knead me to death; Then they floured me as if they would flour me to death.' 'Unlock! unlock!' vociferated the giant in a towering passion; but the cat repeated: 'Just wait a little, little moment, while I tell my story: Then they floured me as if they would flour me to death; Then they pricked me as if they would prick me to death.' The giant was now beside himself with rage, and roared out so that the whole castle shook: 'Unlock! unlock!' But the cat was not to be moved, and answered as before: 'Just wait a little moment, while I tell my story: 'First they kneaded me as if they would knead, me to death; Then they pricked me as if they would prick me to death; Then they baked me as if they would bake me to death.' The giant now felt uneasy, and cried out quite gently: 'Unlock! unlock!' but all in vain; the loaf remained quiet in the key-hole as before. At the same moment the cat cried out: 'Only see what a beautiful girl is riding up in the sky!' As the Troll looked up, the sun had just risen above the forest, at the sight of which he fell back and split into shivers. Such was his end. The loaf then transformed itself again into a cat, and hastened to set everything in order for his guests. After some time, the king's son and his fair young bride arrived with all their train. The cat went out to receive them, and bid them welcome to Cattenburg. They were now entertained most sumptuously, and there was wanting neither meat nor drink, nor any costly luxury. The noble castle was full of gold and silver, and all kinds of precious things, such as the like was never seen before or since. Shortly after the marriage was solemnized between the prince and the fair young maiden; and all who saw her wealth, thought she had good reason for saying: 'I had it otherwise in my castle at Cattenburg.' The king's son and the peasant's daughter lived happily together for very many years; but I have never heard how it fared with the cat; though we may almost guess that he wanted for nothing.", "title": "The Palace That Stood on Golden Pillars", "id": 382}

Along the road she was calculating how she could sell the honey and buy eggs, these eggs would produce chickens, and with the produce of the sale of these latter she would buy lambs; and in this way was calculating how she would become richer than her neighbors, and looked forward with anxiety to well marrying her sons and daughters, and how she would go through the streets, accompanied by her sons and daughters-in-law, and how the people would say what a fortunate woman she was to become so rich, having been so very poor. Under the influence of these pleasurable thoughts, she laughed heartily; when, suddenly striking the jar with her hand, it fell to the ground and was broken. Seeing this, she was in great grief at being so suddenly deprived of all her flattering anticipations; for, having fixed all her thoughts upon an illusion, she lost that which was real.", "title": "What Happened to a Woman Called Truhana", "id": 383}

Now these two humpbacks were from Parma. When the humpback had gone a long way, he came to a square where there was a fair, at which everything was sold. There was a person selling cheese, who cried out: 'Eat the little Parmesan!' The poor humpback thought he meant him, so he ran away and hid himself in a courtyard. When it was one o'clock, he heard a clanking of chains and the words 'Saturday and Sunday' repeated several times. Then he answered: 'And Monday.' 'Oh, heavens!' said they who were singing. 'Who is this who has harmonized with our choir?' They searched and found the poor humpback hidden. 'O gentlemen!' he said, 'I have not come here to do any harm, you know!' 'Well! we have come to reward you; you have harmonized our choir; come with us!' They put him on a table and removed his hump, healed him, and gave him two bags of money. 'Now,' they said, 'you can go.' He thanked them and went away without his hump. He liked it better, you can believe! He returned to his place at Parma, and when the other humpback saw him he exclaimed: 'Does not that look just like my friend? But he had a hump! It is not he! Listen! You are not my friend so and so, are you?' 'Yes, I am,' he replied. 'Listen! Were you not a humpback?' 'Yes. They have removed my hump and given me two bags of money. I will tell you why. I reached,' he continued, 'such and such a place, and I heard them beginning to say, 'Eat the little Parmesan! Eat the little Parmesan!' I was so frightened that I hid myself.' (He mentioned the place -- in a courtyard.) 'At a certain hour, I heard a noise of chains and a chorus singing: 'Saturday and Sunday.' After two or three times, I said: 'And Monday.' They came and found me, saying that I had harmonized their chorus, and they wanted to reward me. They took me, removed my hump, and gave me two bags of money.' 'Oh, heavens!' said the other humpback. 'I want to go there, too!' 'Go, poor fellow, go! Farewell!' The humpback reached the place, and hid himself precisely where his companion had. After a while he heard a noise of chains, and the chorus: 'Saturday and Sunday!' Then another chorus: 'And Monday!' After the humpback had heard them repeat: 'Saturday and Sunday, and Monday!' several times, he added: 'And Tuesday!' 'Where,' they exclaimed, 'is he who has spoiled our chorus? If we find him, we will tear him in pieces.' Just think! they struck and beat this poor humpback until they were tired; then they put him on the same table on which they had placed his companion, and said: 'Take that hump and put it on him in front.' So they took the other's hump and fastened it to his breast, and then drove him away with blows. He went home and found his friend, who cried: 'Mercy! Is not that my friend? But it cannot be, for this one is humpbacked in front. Listen,' he said, 'are you not my friend?' 'The same,' he answered, weeping. 'I did not want to bear my own hump, and now I have to carry mine and yours! and so beaten and reduced, you see!' 'Come,' said his friend, 'come home with me, and we will eat a mouthful together; and don't be disheartened.' And so, every day, he dined with his friend, and afterward they died, I imagine.", "title": "The Two Humpbacks", "id": 384}

His mother not noticing this stirred him into the pudding and put it into the oven. Tom soon grew hotter and hotter until he could stand it no longer, and began to yell and jump up and down. When Tom's mother saw the pudding behave in such a strange manner, she thought it was bewitched and flung it out of the window. The pudding being broken to pieces by the fall, Tom was released and walked in to his mother. Another day a crow saw him and picked him up and flew with him to the top of a giant's castle. The giant saw him and picked him up and put him in his mouth to eat him. Tom tickled his tongue so that the giant took him out and threw him into the river. A large fish then swallowed him. The fish was soon caught for the king. When it was cut open there was Tom. Everybody was delighted with the little fellow. The king liked him so much that he made him his dwarf and Tom became the favourite of the whole court. One day Tom was jumping off a wall when the cook was passing with a bowl of hot milk for the king. Poor Tom jumped into the middle of it and it splashed into the cook's eyes. Down went the bowl to the ground. The cook who was very cross swore to the king that Tom had done it out of mischief. So Tom was tried and sentenced to be put in jail. When the little fellow heard this he felt very bad. With one spring he jumped down the throat of a miller who stood by. Tom being lost the court broke up and the miller went back to his mill. But when he got there Tom did not leave him long at rest. He began to roll and tumble about so that the miller soon had to have a doctor. When the doctor came Tom began to dance and sing and the doctor was as much frightened as the miller was. He sent in great haste for six more doctors; while all those doctors were talking about what they should do the miller yawned and Tom gave a jump and landed in the middle of the table. Then he turned around and made a low bow to each and went home to the king. Tom did not live very long after to enjoy the king's favour. He was always ready to help others in trouble. One day, after trying to rescue a fly from a spiders web, the spider attacked him fiercely and he was so badly wounded that he died soon afterwards. The king and his court missed the cheerful little fellow. In his memory they erected a beautiful monument on which was recorded all the wonderful deeds of Tom Thumb.

{"label": "510A", "text": "One day Prince Malecadel wanted to get married, so he gave a ball, to which he invited all the ladies in his kingdom. He said that the most beautiful of all was to be his wife. When Damiana and Rosa knew that all the ladies were invited, they began to discuss what clothes they would wear to the ball; but poor Maria was in the river, washing the clothes. Maria was very sad and was weeping, for she had no clothes at all in which she could appear at the prince's f\u00c3\u00aate. While she was washing, a crab approached her, and said, 'Why are you crying, Maria? Tell me the reason, for I am your mother.' Then Maria said to the crab, 'I am treated by my aunt (sic!) and sisters as a servant; and there will be a ball tonight, but I have no clothes to wear.' While she was talking to the crab, Juana came up. The stepmother was very angry with Maria, and ordered her to catch the crab and cook it for their dinner. Maria seized the crab and carried it to the house. At first she did not want to cook it, for she knew that it was her mother; but Juana whipped her so hard, that at last she was forced to obey. Before it was put in the earthen pot to be cooked, the crab said to Maria, 'Maria, don't eat my flesh, but collect all my shell after I am eaten, and bury the pieces in the garden near the house. They will grow into a tree, and you can have what you want if you will only ask the tree for it.' After her parents had eaten the flesh of the crab, Maria collected all its shell and buried it in the garden. At twilight she saw a tree standing on the very spot where she had buried the shell. When night came, Rosa and Damiana went to the ball, and Juana retired for the night as soon as her daughters were gone. When Maria saw that her aunt was sleeping, she went into the garden and asked the tree for what she wanted. The tree changed her clothes into very beautiful ones, and furnished her with a fine coach drawn by four fine horses, and a pair of golden slippers. Before she left, the tree said to her, 'You must be in your house before twelve o'clock. If you are not, your clothes will be changed into ragged, dirty ones again, and your coach will disappear.' After promising to remember the warning of the tree, Maria went to the ball, where she was received by the prince very graciously. All the ladies were astonished when they saw her; she was the most beautiful of all. Then she sat between her two sisters, but neither Rosa nor Damiana recognized her. The prince danced with her all the time. When Maria saw that it was half-past eleven, she bade farewell to the prince and all the ladies present, and went home. When she reached the garden, the tree changed her beautiful clothes back into her old ones, and the coach disappeared. Then she went to bed and to sleep. When her sisters came home, they told her of everything that had happened at the ball. The next night the prince gave another ball. After Rosa and Damiana had dressed themselves in their best clothes and gone, Maria again went to the garden to ask for beautiful clothes. This time she was given a coach drawn by five (?) horses, and again the tree warned her to return before twelve. The prince was delighted to see her, and danced with her the whole evening. Maria was so enchanted that she forgot to notice the time. While she was dancing, she heard the clock striking twelve. She ran as fast as she could down stairs and out the palace door, but in her haste she dropped one of her golden slippers. This night she had to walk home, and in her old ragged clothes, too. One of her golden slippers she had with her; but the other, which she had dropped at the door, was found by one of the guards, who gave it to the prince. The guard said that the slipper had been lost by the beautiful lady who ran out of the palace when the clock was striking twelve. Then the prince said to all the people present, 'The lady whom this slipper fits is to be my wife.' The next morning the prince ordered one of his guards to carry the slipper to every house in the city to see if its owner could be found. The first house visited was the one in which Maria lived. Rosa tried to put the slipper on her foot, but her foot was much too big. Then Damiana put it on her foot, but her foot was too small. The two sisters tried and tried again to make the slipper fit, but in vain. Then Maria told them that she would try, and see if the slipper would fit her foot; but her sisters said to her, 'Your feet are very dirty. This golden slipper will not go on your foot, for your feet are larger than ours.' And they laughed at her. But the guard who had brought the slipper said, 'Let her try. It is the prince's order that all shall try.' So he gave it to Maria. Then Maria put it on, and it fitted her foot exactly. She then drew the other slipper from underneath her dress, and put it on her other foot. When the two sisters saw the two slippers on Maria's feet, they almost fainted with astonishment. So Maria became the wife of the prince, and from that time on she was very dear to her sisters and aunt.", "title": "Maria and the Golden Slipper", "id": 386}

{"label": "155", "text": "A peasant in his field once heard a voice calling, 'Help me! Help me!' He looked around but saw no one. Finally he discovered that the voice was coming from below, from beneath a large stone. Rolling it onto its side he saw a hole where there was a large snake. It slithered out and was about to tear the peasant to pieces. 'What!' said the peasant. 'My reward for having freed you from your prison is be torn to pieces?' 'Didn't you know,' replied the snake, 'that ingratitude is the world's reward?' 'I do not believe that,' said the peasant. 'Come, let us go together to a judge who will decide if you have the right to tear me to pieces.' So the went to seek a judge. After going a little way they came to a tree onto which was tied an old horse. 'What are you doing there?' the peasant asked the horse. 'Who tied you here?' 'Oh,' it said, 'my master has gone to fetch a knacker who is to kill me, for I am too old and week to pull the plow and other loads. When I was young and strong, my master had only praise for me, but now he has no use for me, and thus I will have to die.' 'You see, peasant,' said the snake, 'there you have proof that ingratitude is the world's reward. Now I am going to tear you to pieces.' 'No,' said the peasant. 'Let us go to another judge.' So they went further. A dog came ran up to them and sought the peasant's protection against his master, who was about to shoot him. He had now grown unable to watch over the house, and he told the peasant that his master had held him dearly when he was young and could watch over the house and the yard, but now that he was old and weak, he had acquired another dog and wanted to shoot him. 'There you have the second proof that ingratitude is the world's reward,' said the snake. 'You must admit that I have the right to tear you apart.' But the peasant did not want to admit this, and while they were arguing about it, a fox came their way and asked why they were quarreling. 'Wait,' thought the peasant. 'The fox is very sly. He could be our judge.' He explained the case to him, who then took the peasant aside and said to him, 'If you will promise me two roosters then I'll free you from the snake.' 'They will be yours,' said the peasant. 'Now,' said the fox, 'if I am to be your judge then I must see the hole where the snake was caught. I cannot make a judgment until I have seen it.' So they turned around and went back to the hole. Upon seeing it, the fox said, 'What? Such a large snake was caught in this small hole? I do not believe it. It is entirely impossible! First you must convince me that there is room for you there. Snake, crawl inside and show me that you really were caught there.' The snake crawled inside, and he had scarcely done so when then fox quickly rolled the stone back in place, capturing him again, however much he cried out 'Help me!' The peasant was very happy and told the fox to come that evening to fetch the roosters. He would leave the back gate to his yard open so he could get in. The fox came that evening when everyone was eating supper. He found the back gate open and crept inside. But when he neared the chicken coop, the chickens saw him and cried out. The peasant's wife heard the noise, went to see what was wrong, and discovered the fox. 'Wait,' she said, 'I'll light the way home for you.' She ran into the kitchen, picked up a burning piece of wood, ran back to the chicken coop, and hit the fox so long with it until his pelt was all burned up. Crying out, he ran away.

{"label": "592", "text": "Once there lived a couple who had three sons. Two of them passed for the handsomest fellows of the place; but they played every kind of trick on their brother, who was a hunchback. At first the latter took no notice, but the brothers carried their tormenting so far that at last he was compelled to go away from home. The hunchback went sorrowfully on, and wandered the whole day through the mountains. Towards evening he was so weary that he swooned away, and lay on the roadside. On awakening he saw a little man two feet high standing by him, and on the point of pouring a yellow liquid into, his mouth from a bottle. The hunchback looked about him, and saw to his surprise that he was in a cavern, lighted by a faint light. The dwarf spoke to him, and asked whether he was hungry. 'O yes,' he said, and the dwarf led him into another room, where stood a covered table. 'Of these dishes, said the dwarf, 'partake as much as thou wilt; and when thou hast eaten enough, lie down in yonder bed and sleep till I wake thee.' The hunchback did as the dwarf bade him, and soon forgot all his troubles in a sound sleep. Next morning the dwarf awoke him, and after breakfasting they went out of the cave through a long passage lighted here and there by a feeble oil lamp. For two hours they wandered, when suddenly through a door they came into the open. Here the dwarf held out his hand to the hunchback, and said, 'Thou seest here a place quite strange to thee, but fear not, and travel on this road. As a keepsake from me take this little pipe. It has the property of making every one who hears it dance, and that as long as thou pipest.' The dwarf vanished, and the hunchback went on his way. Presently a shepherd met him, and he thought he would try the power of the pipe upon him. He took it in his hand and piped, whereupon the shepherd instantly began to dance. Even the sheep leaped joyously around in a circle. Then be came into a forest, where night surprised him. He got under an elder-bush, and was going to lie down and sleep, when he heard a noise hard by, growing louder every moment. At first he was alarmed, but soon he glided nearer to the spot. Concealed by a drooping branch he observed a number of robbers, who were dividing their booty, consisting of many gold pieces. The glittering gold attracted him, and he bethought him how he could get hold of it. His pipe occurred to him. Quickly he took it in his hand, and blew hard into it. Instantly the robbers got up and danced until they fell down. Then the hunchback came out, took the money and ran away. In the course of a few hours it became brighter, and he arrived at a place where the people seemed to be very sad. He asked the cause, and learned that the landlord, who had been so good to the people, was going to sell his property, and move to another place. The hunchback went to the proprietor, purchased his property, and be came lord of the land. He treated the tenants very kindly, only he was very fond of teasing them with his pipe. One day there came two beggars, who begged an alms from him. He looked more closely at them, and recognized his two brothers. He disclosed himself, and asked how it had come about that they were going round as beggars. They told him that soon after his departure a fire had broken out in the place, which consumed all their property. Their parents could not save themselves in time, and perished. And as the brothers had nothing left, they had set out, and so come to that place. Then they begged the hunchback's pardon for their behaviour to him in the past. He readily granted it, and retained them on his property. But one morning he said to his brothers, 'Dear brothers, I told you how I came into the property. I will now do you a pleasure; look upon the property as your own, and I will go forth to seek another.' At first the brothers refused, but as he would not listen to them, they let him go, and wished him much good luck on the journey. He went on, and had wandered for some months, when one day a gentleman in splendid attire joined him. They spoke of different things, and presently the gentleman showed him a box, saying that it would never be empty. 'I could use that,' said the hunchback. The gentleman promised it to him if he would bind his soul to him. But the hunchback refused, because he knew of an easier way of getting the box. He took his pipe, and piped so long that at last the devil, for such the fine gentleman really was, fell all of a heap. Then he took the box, went into a great city, and lived long, rich and respected. Links to the original German:", "title": "They Dance to the Pipe", "id": 391}
{"label": "402", "text": "A girl belonging to a village of four underground lodges near Lytton refused all suitors who had come from Spences Bridge, Nicola, Kamloops, and Lillooet, although they brought as marriage gifts robes, dentalia, and other valuables. Her parents and the chief of the village were angry with her for refusing so many good suitors. Therefore she became sad, and would have committed suicide had not her brothers talked kindly with her. One morning, when she had gone to the river to bathe and to draw water for the house, she thought, 'I wish a man from far away would come and take me!' Crow-Man, who lived at the mouth of the river, heard her. He said, 'A pretty girl far away wants a husband. I wish I could go to her!' At once a man appeared to him and said, 'I will help you, if you will do as I direct you. You must shut your eyes and pray to me, and I shall grant your desire. Now begin!' Crow-Man knelt down and prayed that he might be enabled to go to the girl. His eyes closed while he was praying. Then his helper told him to open his eyes and look at himself. He saw that he had been transformed into a crow, with wings and with black feathers all over his body. He was afraid, and remained silent. His helper told him that he would not be a crow always, but only for the journey to the girl. He said, 'Now, fly up the river! And early in the morning you will see a girl bathing near four underground lodges. She is the wife that you desire!' It was springtime, when crows come up the river. Three mornings the girl had repeated her supplication for a husband. Early the fourth morning she went to the accustomed place, put down her bark water baskets, took off her clothes, and went to bathe. She had just made her supplication when a crow came up the river and passed close to her head. She called him nasty names and said, 'Why do you fly so close to my head, you black ugly bird? You will blind me with the dirt of your feet.' It was Crow-Man, who was acting under the instructions of his helper. He flew past out of sight, alighted on the ground, shut his eyes, and prayed. When he opened his eyes, he was a man again. He walked back to where the girl was washing herself in the water, and sat down on her clothes. Presently she saw him, and asked him to leave. She pleaded with him to go away, but he paid no heed. When she had asked him four times, he replied, 'If you will become my wife, I will release your clothes.' She assented, saying, 'You must be my husband, for you have seen my naked body.' Crow-Man shut his eyes and prayed. When he opened them again, a large beaverskin robe was there, and a dugout cedar canoe. He gave the robe to his wife. They embarked in the canoe and went downstream. As the girl did not return, the people looked for her. They found her clothes and the water baskets, and thought that she had drowned herself. She lived in her husband's country for a while, and bore a son to him. When the boy was growing up, he wished to see his grandparents. Every day he asked for them. Finally his parents determined to take him to see them. They went up the river in a canoe loaded with presents of many kinds, and eventually reached Lytton. They moored their canoe at the watering place. The weather was warm, and the woman's parents were living in a mat tent. Her younger sister came down to draw water and discovered them. She went back with the news; and the parents cleaned their house, and made ready to receive their son-in-law. He gave his father-in-law all the presents, and the people danced to welcome them. He made up his mind to live there and became an adopted member of the tribe. = Memoirs of the American Folk-Lore Society, vol. 11 (Lancaster and New York: American Folk-Lore Society, 1917), pp. 30-32.

{"label": "510A", "text": "Now that aunt was a Baba Yaga. Well, the girl was no fool, so she went to a real aunt of hers first, and says she, 'Good morning, auntie!' 'Good morning, my dear! What have you come for?' 'Mother has sent me to her sister, to ask for a needle and thread to make me a shift.' Then her aunt instructed her what to do. 'There is a birch tree there, niece, which would hit you in the eye -- you must tie a ribbon round it; there are doors which would creak and bang -- you must pour oil on their hinges; there are dogs which would tear you in pieces -- you must throw them these rolls; there is a cat which would scratch your eyes out -- you must give it a piece of bacon.' So the girl went away, and walked and walked, till she came to the place. There stood a hut, and in it sat weaving the Baba Yaga, the bony-shanks. 'Good morning, auntie,' says the girl. 'Good morning, my dear,' replies the Baba Yaga. ' Mother has sent me to ask you for a needle and thread to make me a shift.' 'Very well; sit down and weave a little in the meantime.' So the girl sat down behind the loom, and the Baba Yaga went outside, and said to her servant maid, 'Go and heat the bath, and get my niece washed; and mind you look sharp after her. I want to breakfast off her.' Well, the girl sat there in such a fright that she was as much dead as alive. Presently she spoke imploringly to the servant maid, saying, 'Kinswoman dear, do please wet the firewood instead of making it burn; and fetch the water for the bath in a sieve.' And she made her a present of a handkerchief. The Baba Yaga waited awhile; then she came to the window and asked, 'Are you weaving, niece? Are you weaving, my dear?' 'Oh yes, dear aunt, I'm weaving.' So the Baba Yaga went away again, and the girl gave the cat a piece of bacon, and asked, 'Is there no way of escaping from here?' 'Here's a comb for you and a towel,' said the cat; 'take them, and be off. The Baba Yaga will pursue you, but you must lay your ear on the ground, and when you hear that she is close at hand, first of all, throw down the towel. It will become a wide, wide river. And if the Baba Yaga gets across the river, and tries to catch you, then you must lay your ear on the ground again, and when you hear that she is close at hand, throw down the comb. It will become a dense, dense forest; through that she won't be able to force her way anyhow.' The girl took the towel and the comb and fled. The dogs would have rent her, but she threw them the rolls, and they let her go by; the doors would have begun to bang, but she poured oil on their hinges, and they let her pass through; the birch tree would have poked her eyes out, but she tied the ribbon around it, and it let her pass on. And the cat sat down to the loom, and worked away; muddled everything about, if it didn't do much weaving. Up came the Baba Yaga to the window, and asked, 'Are you weaving, niece? Are you weaving, my dear?' 'I'm weaving, dear aunt, I'm weaving,' gruffly replied the cat. The Baba Yaga rushed into the hut, saw that the girl was gone, and took to beating the cat, and abusing it for not having scratched the girl's eyes out. 'Long as I've served you,' said the cat, 'you've never given me so much as a bone; but she gave me bacon.' Then the Baba Yaga pounced upon the dogs, on the doors, on the birch tree, and on the servant maid, and set to work to abuse them all, and to knock them about. Then the dogs said to her, 'Long as we've served you, you've never so much as pitched us a burnt crust; but she gave us rolls to eat.' And the doors said, 'Long as we've served you, you've never poured even a drop of water on our hinges; but she poured oil on us.' The birch tree said, 'Long as I've served you, you've never tied a single thread around me; but she fastened a ribbon around me.' And the servant maid said, 'Long as I've served you, you've never given me so much as a rag; but she gave me a handkerchief.' The Baba Yaga, bony of limb, quickly jumped into her mortar, sent it flying along with the pestle, sweeping away the while all traces of its flight with a broom, and set off in pursuit of the girl. Then the girl put her ear to the ground, and when she heard that the Baba Yaga was chasing her, and was now close at hand, she flung down the towel. And it became a wide, such a wide river! Up came the Baba Yaga to the river, and gnashed her teeth with spite; then she went home for her oxen, and drove them to the river. The oxen drank up every drop of the river, and then the Baba Yaga began the pursuit anew. But the girl put her ear to the ground again, and when she heard that the Baba Yaga was near, she flung down the comb, and instantly a forest sprang up, such an awfully thick one! The Baba Yaga began gnawing away at it, but however hard she worked, she couldn't gnaw her way through it, so she had to go back again. But by this time the girl's father had returned home, and he asked, 'Where's my daughter?' 'She's gone to her aunt's,' replied her stepmother. Soon afterwards the girl herself came running home. ' Where have you been?' asked her father. 'Ah, father!' she said, 'mother sent me to aunt's to ask for a needle and thread to make me a shift. But aunt's a Baba Yaga, and she wanted to eat me!' 'And how did you get away, daughter?' 'Why like this,' said the girl, and explained the whole matter. As soon as her father had heard all about it, he became wroth with his wife, and shot her. But he and his daughter lived on and flourished, and everything went well with them.", "title": "The Baba Yaga", "id": 393}
{"label": "562", "text": "Once upon a time there was a soldier who had served the king loyally for many long years. When the war was over and the soldier could no longer serve because of the many wounds he had received, the king said to him, 'You can go home now. I no longer need you. There will be no more money for you, because wages are only for those who earn them.' Because the soldier did not know how he could earn a living, he sadly walked the whole day long, until he came to a forest in the evening. As darkness fell he saw a light. He approached it and came to a little house, where a witch lived. 'Give me a night's shelter and a little to eat and drink,' he said to her, 'otherwise I will perish.' 'Oho!' she answered. 'Who gives anything to a runaway soldier? But I will have pity and take you in after all, if you will do what I ask of you.' 'What do you want?' asked the soldier. 'For you to dig up my garden tomorrow.' The soldier agreed, and the next day he worked with all his might, but could not finish before evening. 'I see,' said the witch, 'that you can do no more work today. I will take you in for one more night if tomorrow you will cut up and split a stack of wood for me.' The soldier took the entire day to do this, and that evening the witch proposed that he remain a third night. 'Tomorrow I have only a small task for you. Behind my house there is a dry well into which my light has fallen. It burns blue and never goes out. I want you to get it for me.' The next day the old woman led him to the well and lowered him down it in a basket. He found the blue light and gave a sign that she should pull him up again. And she did pull him up, but when he was close to the edge, she wanted to take the blue light from him. 'No,' he said, sensing her evil thoughts, 'I shall not give you the light until I am standing on the ground with both feet.' Then the witch became furious, let him fall back into the well, and walked away. The poor soldier fell to the damp floor without being injured. The blue light continued to burn, but how could that help him? He saw that would not be able to escape death. He sadly sat there for a while. Then he happened to reach into his pocket and found his tobacco pipe, which was still half full. 'This will be your last pleasure,' he thought, pulled it out, lit it with the blue light, and began to smoke. After the fumes had wafted about the cavern, suddenly there stood before him a little black dwarf, who said, 'Master, what do you command?' 'Why should I command you?' replied the bewildered soldier. 'I must do everything that you demand,' said the dwarf.' 'Good,' said the soldier, 'then first help me out of this well.' The dwarf took him by the hand and led him through an underground passage, and he did not forget to take the blue light with him. Along the way he showed him the treasures that the witch had collected and hidden there, and the soldier took as much gold as he could carry. When he was above ground, he said to the dwarf, 'Now go and bind the old witch and take her to the judge.' Not long afterward she came riding by on a tomcat as fast as the wind and screaming horribly. And not long after that the dwarf was back. 'It is all taken care of,' he said. 'The witch is hanging on the gallows. Master, what do you command now?' 'Nothing at the moment,' answered the soldier. 'You can go home, but be ready when I call you.' 'It is only necessary,' said the dwarf, 'for you to light your pipe with the blue light, and I will be with you.' With that he disappeared before his very eyes. The soldier returned to the city from which he had come. He moved into the best inn and had beautiful clothes made for himself. Then he told the innkeeper to furnish his room as luxuriously as possible. When it was finished he summoned the black dwarf and said, 'I served the king loyally, but he sent me away to starve. For this I now want revenge.' 'What am I to do?' asked the little man. 'Late this evening, when the king's daughter is lying in bed, bring her here to me in her sleep. She shall do maid service for me.' The dwarf said, 'That is an easy thing for me, but a dangerous thing for you. If you are found out, it will not go well for you.' At the strike of twelve the door opened, and the dwarf carried the king's daughter in. 'Aha, is that you?' cried the soldier. 'Get to work now! Go fetch the broom and sweep the room.' When she was finished he called her to his chair, stuck his feet out at her, and said, 'Pull off my boots,' then threw them in her face, and she had to pick them up and clean them and make them shine. She did everything that he ordered her to do, without resisting, silently, and with half-closed eyes. At the first cock's crow, the dwarf carried her to the royal palace and back to her bed. The next morning, after the king's daughter had gotten up, she went to her father and told him that she had had an amazing dream. 'I was carried away through the streets as fast as lightning and taken to a soldier's room. I had to serve as his maid and wait on him and do common work, sweep the room, and clean his boots. It was only a dream, but still I am as tired as if I had really done it all.' 'The dream could have been true,' said the king. 'I will give you some advice. Fill your pocket with peas, then make a small hole in your pocket. If you are carried away again, they will fall out and leave a track on the street.' As the king was thus speaking, the dwarf was invisibly standing nearby and heard everything. That night when he once again carried the sleeping princess through the streets, a few peas did indeed fall out of her pocket, but they did not leave a track, because the cunning dwarf had already scattered peas in all the streets. And once again the king's daughter had to do maid service until the cock crowed. The next morning the king sent his people out to look for the track, but it was to no end, for in all the streets there were poor children gathering peas and saying, 'Last night it rained peas.' 'We must think of something else,' said the king. 'Leave your shoes on when you go to bed, and before you return from there, hide one of them. I will be sure to find it.' The black dwarf overheard this proposal, and that evening when the soldier again wanted the king's daughter brought to him, the dwarf advised him against this, saying that he had no way to protect him against such trickery. If the shoe were to be found in his room, it would not go well with him. 'Do what I tell you,' replied the soldier, and for a third night the king's daughter had to work like a maid. But before she was carried back, she hid a shoe under the bed. The next morning the king had the entire city searched for the shoe, and it was found in the soldier's room. The soldier himself, following the little man's request, was already outside the city gate, but they soon overtook him and threw him into prison. In his haste, he had forgotten to take along his most valuable things: the blue light and the gold. He had only one ducat in his pocket. Standing at the window of his prison and weighted down with chains, he saw one of his comrades walking by. He knocked on the glass, and as he walked by, he said, 'Be so good and bring me the little bundle that I left at the inn. I'll give you a ducat for it.' The comrade ran forth and brought back the desired things. As soon as the soldier was alone again, he lit his pipe and summoned the black dwarf. 'Have no fear,' he said to his master. 'Just go where they lead you, and let everything happen, but take the blue light with you.' The next day the soldier was tried, and although he had done nothing wrong, the judge still sentenced him to death. As he was being led out, he asked the king for one last wish. 'What sort of a wish?' asked the king. 'That I might smoke one more pipe on the way.' 'You can smoke three,' answered the king, 'but do not think that I will let you live.' Then the soldier pulled out his pipe and lit it with the blue light. As soon as a few rings of smoke had risen, the dwarf was standing there. He had a cudgel in his hand and said, 'What does my master command?' 'Strike the false judges and their henchmen to the ground for me. And don't spare the king either, who has treated me so badly.' Then the dwarf took off like lightning, zip-zap, back and forth, and everyone he even touched with his cudgel fell to the ground and did not dare to move. The king became afraid. He begged for mercy, and in order to save his life, he gave to the soldier his kingdom as well as his daughter for a wife.", "title": "The Blue Light", "id": 394}
{"label": "763", "text": "In Flanders there was a group of young folks who lived for gaming, eating, drinking, and merrymaking. They made these follies and excesses even worse with their wanton and blasphemous curses and oaths. As my story begins, three of these riotous fellows were drinking in a tavern when from the street they heard the sound of a bell accompanying a coffin to its grave. 'Go and ask whose corpse is passing by,' said one of them to a servant boy. 'I already know who it is,' replied the boy. 'He was an old friend of yours. Last night he was suddenly slain while seated dead drunk on his bench. The silent thief who struck him down is the one named Death, the same Death who has taken so many people in our country of late. Be on guard yourselves lest this adversary take you as well!' 'The boy is right,' added the tavern keeper. 'In a village only a mile from here Death has taken man, woman, child, and servant. He must be nearby. Take care, or he will do you harm!' 'Would meeting him be such a peril?' interjected one of the drinkers, then swore an oath on God's sacred bones that he would seek him out. 'Listen, friends,' he added, 'We three have always been as one. Let each of us now hold up his hand and swear an oath of brotherhood. Together we will slay this traitor Death!' And thus with a blasphemous curse, they swore to live and die for each other and together to seek out and challenge Death before the next nightfall. In a drunken rage they set forth toward the village of which the tavern keeper had spoken, swearing grisly oaths as they went. They had not gone a half mile before they met a poor old man. He greeted them humbly, 'God be with you, my lords.' The proudest of these unruly men replied, 'Hey, old man, why are you still hanging onto life at your great age?' The old man looked him in the face and said, 'Because wherever I have wandered, no one will exchange his youth for my age. Thus I must keep my age for as long as it is God's will. Alas, not even Death wants my life.' At the sound of Death's name, one of the gamblers interrupted. 'You mention that traitor Death, the one who is killing all our friends. Are you his spy? Are you one of his servants, sent to slay us young folks? Tell us where he is, or pay the price!' 'Well, sirs,' he said, 'If what you want is to find Death, just turn up this crooked path. I left him sitting under a tree in a grove. He'll still be there. You'll find him.' The three unruly men ran until they came to the tree, and there they found a pile of golden florins, well nigh onto eight bushels of them, they thought. The sight of all the bright and beautiful florins quickly caused them to abandon their search for Death, and their thoughts turned to how they might best protect their newly found treasure. The worst of them spoke the first word, 'Brothers,' he said, 'Fortune has given us this great treasure, but if we carry it home by light of day, people will call us thieves, and our own treasure will send us to the gallows. We must take it home by night, and then with utmost prudence and caution. Let us draw lots to see which one of us should run to town and secretly bring back bread and wine. The other two will stay here and guard the treasure. Then in the night we will carry the treasure to wherever we think is best.' The lot fell to the youngest, and he immediately departed for the town. He had no sooner left when the one said to the other, 'You are my sworn brother, and I will tell you what will profit you the most. You know our friend has gone. There is gold here aplenty, but our shares will be much greater if we divide it by two than if we divide it by three. 'That's true, said the other, 'but what can we do?' The first one answered, 'The two of us are stronger than the one of him. You engage him in a playful wrestling game, and I will run my dagger through his back. Then you do the same thing with your dagger, and all this gold will be for you and me alone.' Now the youngest, while walking toward the town, thought over and over again about the bright new florins. 'If only I could have this treasure to myself,' he said, 'then I would be the happiest man alive!' The Fiend, our Adversary, put into his heart the thought that he might buy poison and thus kill his two friends. And so, arriving in the town, he sought out an apothecary whom he asked for a poison to kill rats and also a polecat that was in his yard. The apothecary answered, 'Here is a mixture that will kill any creature, even if it were to eat an amount no larger than a kernel of grain.' Carrying this poison in a box, he ran to the next street where he borrowed three bottles. He poured poison into two of them, keeping the third one clean for his own drink. Then he filled all three bottles with wine and returned to his friends. But why make a sermon of it? They killed him, just as they had planned, and when the deed was done, one of them said, 'Now let us sit and drink and make merry. Afterward we will bury his body.' And while still talking, he drank from the poisoned bottle, and his friend drank as well, and thus the two of them died. Tale.' Retold and shortened. writing The Canterbury Tales in about 1386.

{"label": "1645", "text": "It was not going well for the peasant of G. in Rinn, and his shoes pinched him on all sides. Once he dreamed that he should go to the bridge at Zirl where he would discover something important. After having the same dream the following night he shared this information with his wife and declared that he wanted to go to Zirl. But his old woman would not allow this, saying, 'Why do you want to waste an entire day and wear out your shoes for nothing? You will not have as much as a green twig to show for yourself!' So he remained unhappily at home, but behold, the next night he had exactly the same dream again. He arose very early and hurried to Zirl. At sunrise he was already standing by the bridge there. After walking back and forth for a quarter hour, he was approached by a goat herder who wished him a good morning, then drove his herd onward. He did not see anyone for a long time after that. Noon finally arrived, and hunger was tormenting him. He took a piece of Turkish bread [a confection made from peanuts] from his pocket and let it suffice, for he was not going to leave the bridge for any price. But however long he waited, no one came to him. He was losing his patience, and he was irritated by the thought of how his wife would laugh at him and ridicule him for his gullibility. But he nevertheless held out, until finally the sun was about to set, and the goat herder returned with his herd. He was more that a little surprised to see that the man from Rinn was still there, and he asked him why he had been waiting there so long. 'You see,' said the peasant, 'I dreamed that if I were to go to the Zirl bridge that I would discover something important.' 'Indeed!' answered the goat herder, laughing. 'And I dreamed that if I were to go to G. in Rinn that I would find a pot of gold beneath the hearth.' The man from Rinn had now heard enough. He ran home to see if the herder's words were true. Arriving home late in the evening, he secretly dismantled his hearth at once, and he did indeed find a pot completely filled with gold. Thus he became the richest peasant far and wide.

'Dear woman,' he said, 'I just fell from heaven, and now I cannot find the hole again.' 'So,' said the old woman, 'if you just fell from heaven, then you must know your way around up there pretty well?' 'Of course,' said the young man. 'Then perhaps you know my son Kees, who died last year?' 'Kees,' said the man. 'Is he your son? And you ask me if I know him? My dear woman, he is my nearest neighbor!' 'That is wonderful,' said the old woman, 'and how is he doing?' 'Quite well! Quite well! But last week he was complaining that his stockings are worn out. And the sausage, the ham, and the butter are all gone, but other than that he is doing well.' 'Oh, man, oh, man! Isn't there anyone there who can take care of his clothes?' 'No,' said the man, 'in heaven you have to take care of your own clothes.' 'Can't he buy sausage and butter?' 'Yes, they are for sale, but everything is terribly expensive, and he cannot afford what is there.' 'Oh dear, it is too bad that Kees still has to be in need now that he is dead. And I could well afford to give him something!' Then the man told her exactly how Kees was doing, and what he was doing, and where he lived. Finally he said that he had to go, otherwise he would be late in returning to heaven. 'Are you going back to heaven now?' asked the old woman. 'Yes, indeed,' he said. 'Then because you know Kees so well, would you be so kind as to do me a great favor? Come home with me, and I will pack a few things that you can give to him.' 'Well,' he said, 'I will do it because it is for Kees, but I shall get my ears pulled for being away so long.' They went together to the farmhouse, and the old woman prepared two packages: one for the man who had fallen from heaven, because he had been so friendly, and one for Kees, but the package for Kees was the larger one. She also gave him a bag of money for her son. Then he took leave in order to make his return trip. Thinking, 'Kees will be so happy when his neighbor comes home, and Kees hears that he has been here,' the old woman watched him until he was out of sight.

{"label": "306", "text": "Somewhere there was a king who had three daughters, princesses. Those three sisters used to go to meet the devils, and the father knew not where they went to. But there was one called Jankos; Halenka [a fairy] aided him. The king asks Jankos, 'Don't you know where my daughters go? Not one single night are they at home, and they are always wearing out new shoes.' Then Jankos lay down in front of the door, and kept watch to see where they went to. But Halenka told him everything; she aided him. 'They will, when they come, fling fire on you, and prick you with needles.' Halenka told him he must not stir, but be like a corpse. They came, those devils, for the girls, and straightway the girls set out with them to hell. On, on, they walked, but he stuck close to them. As the girls went to hell he followed close behind, but so that they knew it not. He went through the diamond forest; when he came there he cut himself a diamond twig from the forest. He follows; straightway they, those girls, cried, 'Jankos is coming behind us.' For when he broke it, he made a great noise. The girls heard it. 'Jankos is coming behind us.' But the devils said, 'What does it matter if he is?' Next they went through the forest of glass, and once more he cut off a twig; now he had two tokens. Then they went through the golden forest, and once more he cut off a twig; so now he had three. Then Halenka tells him, 'I shall change you into a fly, and when you come into hell, creep under the bed, hide yourself there, and see what will happen.' Then the devils danced with the girls, who tore their shoes all to pieces, for they danced upon blades of knives, and so they must tear them. Then they flung the shoes under the bed, where Jankos took them, so that he might show them at home. When the devils had danced with the girls, each of them threw his girl upon the bed and lay with her; thus did they with two of them, but the third would not yield herself. Then Jankos, having got all he wanted, returned home and lay down again in front of the door, 'that the girls may know I am lying here.' The girls returned after midnight, and went to bed in their room as if nothing had happened. But Jankos knew well what had happened, and straightway he went to their father, the king, and showed him the tokens. 'I know where your daughters go: to hell. The three girls must own they were there, in the fire. Isn't it true? weren't you there? And if you believe me not, I will show you the tokens. See, here is one token from the diamond forest; then here is one from the forest of glass; a third from the golden forest; and the fourth is the shoes which you tore dancing with the devils. And two of you lay with the devils, but that third one not, she would not yield herself.' Straightway the king seized his rifle, and straightway he shot them dead. Then he seized a knife, and slit up their bellies, and straightway the devils were scattered out from their bellies. Then he buried them in the church, and laid each coffin in front of the altar, and every night a soldier stood guard over them. But every night those two used to rend the soldier in pieces; more than a hundred were rent thus. At last it fell to a new soldier, a recruit, to stand guard; when he went upon guard he was weeping. But a little old man came to him -- it was my God; and Jankos was there with the soldier. And the old man tells him, 'When the twelfth hour strikes and they come out of their coffins, straightway jump in and lie down in the coffin, and don't leave the coffin, for if you do they will rend you. So don't you go out, even if they beg you and fling fire on you, for they will beg you hard to come out.' Thus then till morning he lay in the coffin. In the morning those two were alive again, and both kneeling in front of the altar. They were lovelier than ever. Then the soldier took one to wife, and Jankos took the other. Then when they came home with them their father was very glad. Then Jankos and the soldier got married, and if they are not dead they are still alive.

{"label": "1319", "text": "The Gooroo Noodle and His Five Disciples Decide to Purchase a Horse The Gooroo demanded how much the price of a horse would amount to. As they heard upon enquiry that it could not cost less than from fifty to a hundred pagodas, the Gooroo determined that he had not ability to pay so much. The matter thus remained a good while under consideration, when one day they perceived that their milch cow which had been turned out to feed, did not return home at the close of the evening; they sought her all over the village, but as, notwithstanding their search, she was not to be found, Blockhead on the following day went to seek her in the surrounding villages. On his return to the Mattam the third day, unable to discover her anywhere, he exclaimed with delight, 'The cow, Sir, I cannot find: 'tis no matter, however, for I have met with a horse for us at a very low price.'' 'How is that?' demanded the Gooroo with eagerness. To which Blockhead replied, 'When I was on my return, after I had been searching from village to village, from common to common, from enclosure to enclosure, in order to find the milch cow, I perceived four or five mares grazing and reposing on the bank of a large lake. As I went on farther I found, in a place which was near, a number of horses' eggs hanging down in every direction, which could not be encompassed by one's two arms. Upon enquiry of one who came up, he informed me that they were in truth horses' eggs, and that the price of each of them was only four or five pagodas. Here is a fine opportunity, Sir. We can thus, at an easy rate, obtain a high bred horse, and as for its docility, this will depend upon the manner in which we rear it and break it in.' They all consented to this proposition, and having united Idiot with him, delivered into their hands five pagodas, and despatched them forthwith on their journey. After Blockhead and Idiot had set out, in the manner just mentioned, to purchase the horse's egg, Fool thus threw out a doubt. 'Grant that the egg of a high bred courser be obtained, still when obtained, it is only after having been sat upon that it will be hatched; but who in the world is to hatch it I am sure I do not know. He says that it is not to be encompassed by one's two arms: though then we were to keep ten hens together upon it, they could not even stand upon it, much less cover it. Tell us then how we arc to manage in this business.' On hearing what he said, they all stared at each other with astonishment, and without opening their mouths, remained speechless. After a considerable pause, the Gooroo addressed himself separately to each of the three who were present, saying, 'I see no other way but that one of us should sit on it.' Upon this each made his excuses. 'It is my business,' says one, 'to go daily to the river and fetch all the water that is wanted, as also to go to the jungle and procure canes for firewood, how therefore can I possibly hatch it?' Says another, 'After remaining night and day without intermission in the kitchen, dressing rice, cooking all kinds of curries, making fancy cakes and boiling water, for everybody, thus killing myself at the stoves, how can the hatching be performed by me?' Says another, 'Before daybreak I go to the river, and after having cleansed my teeth, rinsed my mouth, washed my face, purified my hands and feet, and completed all my ceremonies according to the rules, I have to go round the flower gardens, cull the new buds, bring them hither with due respect, tie long garlands, strew flowers over different idols, at the same time worshipping them, and daily assist at the Poojei of the deity. Such is my business; is it not? With all this, how can I hatch it?' To this the Gooroo replied, ''This is all quite true; neither can it be accomplished by the other two who are gone away; for one of them has more business than he can finish, in making enquiries respecting those who come and go, in giving answers to the questions which they propose, and in hearing and settling the disputes which are brought before him. Finally, Blockhead, on all occasions when we wish to transact any business, is he not the person who goes to the shops, to the fairs and to the villages? It is very true, therefore, that you must follow those occupations which constantly require your attention. For my part, am I not here doing nothing? I will place the egg in my lap, embrace it with my arms, cover it with the skirt of my cloth, hug it in my bosom, guard it with tenderness, and thus hatch it. It is enough if we do but produce the horse, we will not regard the trouble which is to be endured.' Whilst all this deliberation was taking place in the Mattam, Blockhead and Idiot, who had set out in the third watch with the rising moon, after a journey of more than two kadams and a half, bent their course towards the mark which they had before seen and noticed, and arrived at the borders of the lake where there was an abundance of pumpkins in fruit. On perceiving this, being greatly delighted, they went to the countryman who was attending there and entreated him, saying, 'Master, we earnestly conjure you to give us one of these eggs.' He, in his turn, seeing their idiotism, said, 'Hey-day! do you suppose yourselves fit to buy such high bred horses' eggs as these? They are very costly indeed.' To this they replied, 'Go to Master, do we not know that five pagodas is the price of them? Look ye, friend, take your five pagodas and give us a good egg.' To this he answered, ''You are, to be sure, fine honest fellows. In consideration of your good qualities, I consent to give them to you at this price; select therefore an egg to your liking, and go your ways, but do not publish it abroad that you have obtained it at this easy rate.' They both of them selected and took away a fruit which was larger than all the rest, and rising early the next morning, they set out on their journey just as the day was breaking. Blockhead having carefully taken the egg and lifted it on his head, the other went before shewing the way, and while they were thus going along, Blockhead began to say, 'Ay, ay, our forefathers have said, They who perform penance, are forwarding their own affairs. We have now seen the proof of this with our own eyes. This in truth is the profit which has accrued by the penance continually performed by our Gooroo. A high bred horse, which is worth a hundred or a hundred and fifty pagodas, we purchase and take to him for five.' To which Idiot replied, 'Needs this any reflection? Hast thou not heard the saying -- From pious actions alone proceeds delight; all else is irrelevant and unworthy of praise. From virtue, not only profit, but pleasure proceeds; except there be virtue, all else will be misery and disgrace. Did not my father for a long time practise many virtues; and he found his profit and delight in the end, in having me born to him.' To which the other replied, 'Can this be doubted? If you sow a castor oil tree, will an ebony tree he produced? From good actions, good will proceed, from evil actions, evil.' Thus conversing, after they had walked along for a considerable distance, the pumpkin, from striking against the bough of a tree which was bent and hanging down, was dashed out of his hands, and suddenly tumbling upon some shrubs which were spreading in bushes below, cracked and fell to pieces. Upon this, a hare which was sitting in the bushes started up and ran away. Taking the alarm, they cried out, ''Behold! The horse's foal which was in the shell has run away;' and followed after to catch and seize it. Running, regardless of hills or dales, or woods or commons, the clothes which they had on became entangled in the thorny bushes, and were partly torn and partly detained. They continued the pursuit, with their flesh lacerated by the stumps which they trod on, their blood flowing in consequence of the thorns which stuck into them, their bodies all streaming with perspiration, their hearts beating, their two ears closed, puffing and blowing with fatigue, and their bowels jolting; notwithstanding which, the hare was not caught, and they both fell down, wearied out and harassed with fatigue. In the meantime the hare went on, and becoming concealed, so as no longer to be kept in sight, it ran away to a great distance. They too, regardless of their weariness, rose up, and with legs limping and wounded by thorns, stones and stumps, searched in every direction. Journeying in this afflicted condition, they suffered hunger and fasting all that day, and after sunset arrived at the Mattam. When they entered in at the gate, they smote their mouths, crying, 'Alas! Alas!' and beating themselves, fell down. 'What is it? What is it? What harm has come to you?' demanded the rest; who came, and, taking them by the hand, raised them up. After the two had related in detail all the circumstances that had happened. Blockhead spoke as follows: 'O Sir, since the day that I was born, I never beheld so swift a horse as this: of an ash colour, mixed with black; in form and size like a hare, and a cubit in length. Although a foal still in the nest, it pricked up its two ears, cocked its tail, which rose up the length of two fingers, extended and stretched forth its four legs, and with its heart close to the ground, ran with a swiftness and impetuosity which can neither be expressed nor conceived.' Upon this they were all bewailing, when the Gooroo appeasing them, said, 'True indeed, the five pagodas are gone, but however, it is well that the horse's foal is gone also; if whilst a foal it runs in this manner, when hereafter it shall become full grown, who will be able to ride upon it? I truly am an old man: a horse of this description, my friends, although it were presented to me gratis, I would not accept.'", "title": "The Purchase of the Horse's Egg", "id": 401}
{"label": "480", "text": "A widow had two daughters; the one was beautiful and industrious, the other ugly and lazy. The mother greatly favored the ugly, lazy girl. The other one had to do all the work, and was truly a Cinderella. One day while pulling a bucket of water from the well she leaned over too far and fell in. Recovering, she found herself in a beautiful meadow. The sun was shining, and there were thousands of flowers. She walked along and soon came to an oven full of bread. The bread called out, 'Take me out, or I'll burn! I've been thoroughly baked for a long time!' The girl took the bread from the oven and walked further until she came to a tree laden with ripe apples. 'Shake me! Shake me! We apples are all ripe!' cried the tree, and the girl shook the tree until the apples fell as though it were raining apples. When none were left in the tree, she continued on her way. Finally she came to a small house. An old woman was peering out from inside. She had very large teeth, which frightened the girl, and she wanted to run away. But the old woman called out to her, 'Don't be afraid, dear child. Stay here with me, and if you do my housework in an orderly fashion, it will go well with you. Only you must take care to make my bed well and shake it until the feathers fly, then it will snow in the world. I am Frau Holle.' Because the old woman spoke so kindly to her, the girl agreed, and started in her service. She took care of everything to her satisfaction and always shook her featherbed vigorously. Therefore she had a good life with her: no angry words, and cooked meals every day. Now after she had been with Frau Holle for a time, her heart saddened. Even though she was many thousands of times better off here than at home, still she had a yearning for home. Finally she said to the old woman, 'I have such a longing for home, and even though I am very well off here, I cannot stay longer.' Frau Holle said, 'You are right, and because you have served me so faithfully, I will take you back myself.' With that she took her by the hand and led her to a large gate. The gate was opened, and while the girl was standing under it, an immense rain of gold fell, and all the gold stuck to her, so that she was completely covered with it. 'This is yours because you have been so industrious,' said Frau Holle. With that the gate was closed and the girl found herself above in the world. She went home to her mother, and because she arrived all covered with gold, she was well received. When the mother heard how she had come to the great wealth, she wanted to achieve the same fortune for the other, the ugly and lazy daughter. She made her go and jump into the well. Like the other one, she too awoke in a beautiful meadow, and she walked along the same path. When she came to the oven, the bread cried again, 'Oh, take me out, take me out, or else I'll burn! I've been thoroughly baked for a long time!' But the lazy one answered, 'As if I would want to get all dirty,' and walked away. Soon she came to the apple tree. It cried out, 'Oh, shake me, shake me, we apples are all ripe.' But she answered, 'Oh yes, one could fall on my head,' and with that she walked on. When she came to Frau Holle's house, she was not afraid, because she had already heard about her large teeth, and she immediately began to work for her. On the first day she forced herself, was industrious and obeyed Frau Holle, when she said something to her, because she was thinking about all the Gold that she would give her. But on the second day she already began to be lazy, on the third day even more so, then she didn't even want to get up in the morning. She did not make the bed for Frau Holle, the way she was supposed to, and she did not shake it until the feathers flew. Frau Holle soon became tired of this and dismissed her of her duties. This is just what the lazy girl wanted, for she thought that she would now get the rain of gold. Frau Holle led her too to the gate. She stood beneath it, but instead of gold, a large kettle full of pitch spilled over her. 'That is the reward for your services,' said Frau Holle, and closed the gate. Then the lazy girl returned home, entirely covered with pitch, and it would not come off as long as she lived. Every day the poor girl had to take a seat on the road by a well and had to spin so much that the blood sprang from her fingers. Now it happened once that the spool was entirely bloody, and she leaned over into the well and wanted to wash it off; but it jumped from her hand and fell down. She cried, ran to her stepmother and told her of the misfortune. She scolded her severely and was so uncompassionate that she said, 'You let the spool fall, so go get it back.' Then the girl went back to the well and didn't know what she should do; and in her great fear she jumped into the well, in order to get the spool.", "title": "Frau Holle", "id": 402}

He exhibited the glassware on a large tray, then fell to musing: These pieces will bring me two hundred dirhams, which I can use to buy more glass, which I will then sell for four hundred dirhams. With this money I can buy more glass and other merchandise to sell, and so on and so on until I have amassed a hundred thousand dirhams. Then I will purchase a fine house with slaves and eunuchs, and when my capital has grown to a hundred thousand dinars, I will demand to marry the Prime Minister's eldest daughter, and if he refuses consent, I will take her by force. On my wedding night I will don my finest attire and seat myself on a cushion of gold brocade to receive my bride. She will present herself in her most beautiful clothing, lovely as the full moon, but I will not even glance at her until her attendants kiss the ground before me and beg me to look at her, and then I will cast at her one single glance. When they leave us alone I will neither look at her nor speak to her, but will show my contempt by lying beside her with my face to the wall. Presently her mother will come into the chamber and beg of me, 'Please, my lord, your handmaid longs for your favor.' I will give no answer. Then she will kiss my feet and say, 'My lord, my daughter is truly a beautiful maid who has never before been with a man. Do speak to her and soothe her mind and spirit.' Then she will bring a cup of wine, hand it to her daughter, saying, 'Take this to your lord.' I will say nothing, leaning back so that she may see in me a sultan and a mighty man. She will say to me, 'My lord, do not refuse to take this cup from the hand of your servant.' I will say nothing, and she will insist, 'You must drink it,' and press the cup to my lips. Then I will shake my fist in her face and kick her with my foot. With that he struck out, catching the tray of glassware with his foot. It crashed to the ground and everything broke to pieces, and thus my brother lost both his capital and his profit. translated from the Arabic by Richard F.

One day while sleeping on the bedstead, with the earthenware vessel full of oil and honey, he began to say within himself: If I sold this honey and oil, I might sell it for a dinar and with the dinar I might buy ten she-goats, and after five months they would have young, and after a lapse of five years these would have young and their number would become very large, and I should buy two yoke of oxen and a cow, and I should sow my fields and reap much corn and amass much oil, and I should buy a certain number of servants and maid-servants, and when I had taken to myself a wife of beautiful appearance and she had borne me a handsome son, I should instruct him and he would be secretary to the king.

'Oh! my Lord Bruin, I've been out fishing and caught them,' said the fox.  So the bear had a mind to learn to fish too, and bade the fox tell him how he was to set about it.  'Oh! it's an easy craft for you,' answered the fox, and soon learnt. You've only got to go upon the ice, and cut a hole and stick your tail down into it; and so you must go on holding it there as long as you can. You're not to mind if your tail smarts a little; that's when the fish bite. The longer you hold it there the more fish you'll get; and then all at once out with it, with a cross pull sideways, and with a strong pull too.'  Yes; the bear did as the fox had said, and held his tail a long, long time down in the hole, till it was fast frozen in. Then he pulled it out with a cross pull, and it snapped short off.

{"label": "402", "text": "There are a king and a queen of a certain city, and there is a daughter of the queen. They asked permission to summon the daughter to go in marriage to the prince of another city. The king said, 'Ha,' so they came from that city to summon the king's princess. After coming, they told the bride to come out of her chamber in order to eat the rice of the wedding feast. The queen said, 'She is eating cooked rice in the house.' Then they told her to come out in order to dress her in the robes sent by the bridegroom. The queen said, 'She is putting on robes in her chamber.' Then they told her to come out in order to go to the bridegroom's city. So the queen told two persons to come, and, having put a female mouseling in an incense box, brought it, and gave it into the hands of the two persons, and said, 'Take this, and until seven days have gone by, do not open the mouth of the box.' Having taken it to the city, when they opened the mouth of the box after seven days, a mouse sprang out, and hid itself among the cooking pots. There was also a servant girl at the prince's house. The girl apportioned and gave cooked rice and vegetable curry to the prince, and covered up the cooking pots containing the rest of the food. Then the mouseling came and, having taken and eaten some of the cooked rice and vegetables, covered up the cooking pots, and went again among the pots. On the following day the same thing occurred. The prince said to the girl, 'Does the mouseling eat the cooked rice? Look and come back.' The girl, having gone and looked, came back and said, 'She has eaten the cooked rice, and covered the cooking pots, and has gone.' The prince said, 'Go also, and eat rice, and come back.' So the girl went and ate rice, and returned. Next day the prince said, 'I am going to cut paddy (growing rice). Remain at the house, and in the evening place the articles for cooking near the hearth.' Then the prince went. Afterwards, in the evening, the girl placed the things for cooking near the hearth, and went out of the way. The mouseling came, and cooked, and placed the food ready, and again went behind the pots. After evening had come, that girl apportioned and gave the rice to the prince. The prince ate, and told the girl, 'Go also, and eat rice, and come back.' So the girl went and ate rice, and, having covered the cooking pots, came to the place where the prince was. Then the mouseling came and ate rice, and covered up the pots. After that, she said to the other mice, 'Let us go and cut the paddy,' and, collecting a great number of mice, cut all the paddy, and again returned to the house, and stayed among the pots. Next day when the prince went to the rice field to cut the paddy, all had been cut. Afterwards the prince came back, and, saying 'Let us go and collect and stack the paddy,' collected the men, and stacked it, and threshed it by trampling it with buffaloes. Then they went and called the women, and, having got rid of the chaff in the wind, brought the paddy home. After they had brought it, the prince went near the place where the cooking pots were stored, at which the mouseling was hidden, and said, 'Having pounded this paddy to remove the husk, and cooked rice, let us go to your village to present it to your parents as the first-fruits.' The mouseling said, 'I will not. You go.' So the prince told the girl to pound the paddy and cook rice, and having done this she gave it to the prince. The prince took the package of cooked rice, and went to the mouseling's village, and gave it to the mouseling's mother. The queen asked at the hand of the prince, 'Where is the girl?' The prince said, 'She refused to come.' The queen said, 'Go back to the city, and, having placed the articles for cooking near the hearth, get hid, and stay in the house.' After the prince returned to the city, he did as she had told him. The mouseling, having come out, took off her mouse jacket, and, assuming her shape as a girl, put on other clothes. While she was preparing to cook, the prince took the mouse jacket and burnt it. Afterwards, when the girl went to the place where the mouse jacket had been, and looked for it, it was not there. Then she looked in the hearth, and saw that there was one sleeve in it. While she was there weeping and weeping, the prince came forward and said, 'Your mother told me to burn the mouse jacket.'

Ramai looked about and seeing no one said 'Who is that speaking?' and the voice said 'I am buried under the stone; if you will take it off me I will give you whatever boon you ask.' Ramai said that he was afraid that the bonga would eat him but the bonga swore to do him no harm, so he lifted up the stone and the bonga came out and thanking Ramai told him to ask a boon. Ramai asked for the power to see bongas and to understand the language of ants. 'I will give you the power,' said the bonga, 'but you must tell no one about it, not even your wife; if you do you will lose the power and in that case you must not blame me,' Then the bonga blew into his ear and he heard the speech of ants; and the bonga scratched the film of his eye balls with a thorn and he saw the bongas: and there were crowds of them living in villages like men. In December when we thresh the rice the bongas carry off half of it; but Ramai could see them and would drive them away and so was able to save his rice. Once a young fellow of his own age was very ill; and his friends blew into his ears and partially brought him to his senses and he asked them to send for Ramai; so they called Ramai and he had just been milking his cows and came with the tethering rope in his hand; and when he entered the room he saw a bonga sitting on the sick man's chest and twisting his neck; so he flogged it with the rope till it ran away and he pursued it until it threw itself into a pool of water; and then the sick man recovered.

Now the little girl went to school, and she walked on some ice, slipped and fell, and broke off one of her little legs. They picked her up and carried her back to her mother and told her that she had fallen on some ice and broken off one of her little legs. The mother cried many tears and then had the surgeon come and said to him, 'If only you could bring the little girl so far that she could walk on her legs again.' The surgeon looked at the little leg from this side and that side and then said, 'The girl must have a little golden leg.' So the mother had a little golden leg made and placed on the girl, but it did not help. A little while later the door opened and Death entered. 'Oh!' said the lady. 'Are you going to take my dear, dear child away from me?' 'Yes,' said Death, 'her time and her hour have come. She must go with me.' 'Oh!' said the mother to her child. 'Are you going to leave me?' 'Mother, dear,' said the child, 'I must! I would like to stay here, but Death will not allow it.' Then Death took the little girl by the hand and went out the door with her. When the child was buried the gravedigger broke open the casket and took the little golden leg off the little girl and went home with it.

In the night the devil came to her in the form of her beloved, and he called upon her to pledge her soul to him. In return he would accompany her, in this form, as long as she lived. Further, he would give her great magic power. She agreed to this, and the devil remained with her. He was not exactly invisible, but still secret, and no one knew about him. After a while he advised her to enter a convent, which she did. She would now lock herself in her cell with her beloved, while her phantom form was praying in the church. She gained the reputation of great piety, and soon afterward became the abbess. From this time forward miraculous events began to occur in the convent. Most prominently, from time to time several nuns were attacked with long-lasting and unknown ailments, which she was able to cure through her apparent intercession. Thus her holy reputation grew ever greater. The first suspicion came from several children who often visited the convent. The abbess, who loved children, would show them magic tricks whenever she was alone with them. She told others about this, although she had strictly forbidden them to do so. Above all, the abbess would ask the children if they would like her to make some little mice for them, whereupon the table would immediately be crawling with small, tame mice. The children were too young for one to give much credibility to their talk, but once a young nun, on her way to church, passed by the abbess's cell and heard the abbess whispering lightly with a man's voice. Curious, she looked through the keyhole and saw the abbess and an officer. But when she entered the church she saw the abbess's form praying there before the altar, and she feinted with fright. Afterward she reported what she had seen. The abbess was arrested in her bed that night. She very forward, saying that she would get up and go along with them if they would just reach her stick to her. Someone standing there threw the first stick to her that came to hand, but she refused it, asking for a specific other one. They took note of this and refused to give it to her, in spite of her cunning pretenses. Even after she was put in jail, she continued to try to get hold of the stick through all kinds of tricks, but to no avail. She finally lost her daring, and shortly before she was executed, she confessed. If she had gotten hold of the stick, no power on earth would have been able to restrain her. She was finally burned to death, after having confessed many things. Nachla\u00c3\u009f, edited by Heinz R\u00c3\u00b6lleke (Bonn: Bouvier Verlag Herbert Grundmann, 1979), Nr. 26, pp. 66-67.

{"label": "425C", "text": "Once there was a man who had three daughters, of whom he was devotedly fond. They were skilful in embroidery; and he used every day on his way home from work to gather some flowers for them to use as patterns. One day when he found no flowers along his route homeward he went into the woods to look for wild blossoms, and he unwittingly invaded the domain of a fairy serpent, that coiled around him, held him tightly, and railed at him for having entered his garden. The man excused himself, saying that he came merely to get a few flowers for his daughters, who would be sorely disappointed were he to go home without his usual gift to them. The snake asked him the number, the names, and the ages of his daughters, and then refused to let him go unless he promised one of them in marriage to him. The poor man tried every argument he could think of to induce the snake to release him upon easier terms, but the reptile would accept no other ransom. At last the father, dreading greater evil to his daughters should they be deprived of his protection, gave the required promise and went home. He could eat no supper, however, for he knew the power of fairies to afflict those who offend them, and he was full of anxiety concerning the misfortunes that must overwhelm his whole family should the compact be disregarded. Some days passed; his daughters carefully prepared his meals, and affectionately besought him to eat them, but he would not come to the table. He was always plunged in sorrowful meditation. They conferred among themselves as to the cause of his uncommon behavior, and, having decided that one of them must have displeased him, they agreed to try to find out which one it might be, by going separately, each in turn, to urge him to eat. The eldest went, expressed her distress at his loss of appetite, and urged him to partake of food. He replied that he would do so if she would for his sake marry the snake to whom he had promised a wife. She bluntly refused to carry out her father's contract, and left him in deeper trouble than before. The second daughter then went to beg him to take food, received the same reply, and likewise declined meeting the engagement he had made. The youngest daughter then went and entreated him to eat, heard his story, and at once declared that, if he would care for his own health properly, she would become the bride of the serpent. The father therefore took his meals again, the days sped without bringing calamity, and the welfare of the family for a time seemed secure. But one morning, as the girls were sitting at their embroidery, a wasp flew into the room and sang: 'Buzz! I buzz and come the faster; Who will wed the snake, my master? Whenever the wasp alighted the girls prodded him with their needles, and followed him up so closely that he had to flee for his life. The next morning two wasps came, singing the same refrain; the third morning three wasps came; and the number of wasps increased day by day, until the girls could no longer put them to rout, nor endure their stings. Then the youngest said that, in order to relieve the family of the buzzing plague, she would go to her uncanny bridegroom. The wasps accompanied her on the road, and guided her into the woods where the fairy serpent awaited her in a palace that he had built for her reception. There were spacious rooms with carved furniture inlaid with precious stones, chests full of silken fabrics, caskets of jade, and jewels of gold. The snake had beautiful eyes and a musical voice; but his skin was warty, and the girl shuddered at the thought of daily seeing him about. After the wedding supper, at which the two sat alone, the girl told her spouse that she appreciated the excellence of all that he had provided for her, and that she should perform all her domestic duties exactly. For many days she kept the house neat, cooked the food, and made all things pleasant for her repulsive bridegroom. He doted upon her, and pined whenever she was out of his sight. So heedful was he of her wishes and her welfare, that she grew to like his companionship, and to feel a great lonesomeness whenever he was absent. Having no help in her household work, she was, one day, on finding the well dried up, obliged to go into the forest in search of water, which she finally discovered and toilsomely brought back from a distant spring. On returning she found the snake dying of thirst, and in her eagerness to save his life she grasped and plunged him into the water, from which he rose transformed, a strong and handsome man. He had been the subject of wicked enchantment, from which her dutiful quest and gracious pity set him free. Thereafter she often with her admirable husband visited her old home and carried gifts to those who were less happy than she.", "title": "The Fairy Serpent", "id": 412}
{"label": "333", "text": "Once upon a time, there was a little darling damsel, whom everybody loved that looked upon her, but her old granny loved her best of all, and didn't know what to give the dear child for love. Once she made her a hood of red samite, and since that became her so well, and she, too, would wear nothing else on her head, people gave her the name of 'Red Hood.' Once her mother said to Red Hood, 'Go; here is a slice of cake and a bottle of wine; carry them to old granny. She is ill and weak, and they will refresh her. But be pretty behaved, and don't peep about in all corners when you come into her room, and don't forget to say 'Good-day.' Walk, too, prettily, and don't go out of the road, otherwise you will fall and break the bottle, and then poor granny will have nothing.' Red Hood said, 'I will observe everything well that you have told me,' and gave her mother her hand upon it. But granny lived out in a forest, half an hour's walk from the village. When Red Hood went into the forest, she met a wolf. But she did not know what a wicked beast he was, and was not afraid of him. 'God help you, Red Hood!' said he. 'God bless you, wolf!' replied she. 'Whither so early, Red Hood?' 'To granny.' 'What have you there under your mantle?' 'Cake and wine. We baked yesterday; old granny must have a good meal for once, and strengthen herself therewith.' 'Where does your granny live, Red Hood?' 'A good quarter of an hour's walk further in the forest, under yon three large oaks. There stands her house; further beneath are the nut trees, which you will see there,' said Red Hood. The wolf thought within himself, 'This nice young damsel is a rich morsel. She will taste better than the old woman; but you must trick her cleverly, that you may catch both.' For a time he went by Red Hood's side Then said he, 'Red Hood! Just look! There are such pretty flowers here! Why don't you look round at them all? Methinks you don't even hear how delightfully the birds are singing! You are as dull as if you were going to school, and yet it is so cheerful in the forest!' Little Red Hood lifted up her eyes, and when she saw how the sun's rays glistened through the tops of the trees, and every place was full of flowers, she bethought herself, 'If I bring with me a sweet smelling nosegay to granny, it will cheer her. It is still so early, that I shall come to her in plenty of time,' and therewith she skipped into the forest and looked for flowers. And when she had plucked one, she fancied that another further off was nicer, and ran there, and went always deeper and deeper into the forest. But the wolf went by the straight road to old granny's, and knocked at the door. 'Who's there?' 'Little Red Hood, who has brought cake and wine. Open!' 'Only press the latch,' cried granny. 'I am so weak that I cannot stand.' The wolf pressed the latch, walked in, and went without saying a word straight to granny's bed and ate her up. Then he took her clothes, dressed himself in them, put her cap on his head, lay down in her bed and drew the curtains. Meanwhile little Red Hood was running after flowers, and when she had so many that she could not carry any more, she bethought her of her granny, and started on the way to her. It seemed strange to her that the door was wide open, and when she entered the room everything seemed to her so peculiar, that she thought, 'Ah! My God! How strange I feel today, and yet at other times I am so glad to be with granny!' She said, 'Good-day!' but received no answer. Thereupon she went to the bed and undrew the curtains. There lay granny, with her cap drawn down to her eyes, and looking so queer! 'Ah, granny! Why have you such long ears?' 'The better to hear you.' 'Ah, granny! Why have you such large eyes?' 'The better to see you.' 'Ah, granny! Why have you such large hands?' 'The better to take hold of you.' 'But, granny! Why have you such a terribly large mouth?' 'The better to eat you up!' And therewith the wolf sprang out of bed at once on poor little Red Hood, and ate her up. When the wolf had satisfied his appetite, he lay down again in the bed, and began to snore tremendously. A huntsman came past, and bethought himself, 'How can an old woman snore like that? I'll just have a look to see what it is.' He went into the room, and looked into the bed; there lay the wolf. 'Have I found you now, old rascal?' said he. 'I've long been looking for you.' He was just going to take aim with his gun, when he bethought himself, 'Perhaps the wolf has only swallowed granny, and she may yet be released.' Therefore he did not shoot, but took a knife and began to cut open the sleeping wolf's maw. When he had made several cuts, he saw a red hood gleam, and after one or two more cuts out skipped Red Hood, and cried, 'Oh, how frightened I have been; it was so dark in the wolf's maw!' Afterwards out came old granny, still alive, but scarcely able to breathe. But Red Hood made haste and fetched large stones, with which they filled the wolf's maw, and when he woke he wanted to jump up and run away, but the stones were so heavy that he fell on the ground and beat himself to death. Now, they were all three merry. The huntsman took off the wolf's skin; granny ate the cake and drank the wine which little Red Hood had brought, and became strong and well again; and little Red Hood thought to herself, 'As long as I live, I won't go out of the road into the forest, when mother has forbidden me.'

Lower Lusatia (German Niederlausitz, Polish Dolne \u00c5\u0081u\u00c5\u00bcyce) is a mixed German and Slavic historical and cultural region in today's eastern German and western Poland. Note by Wratslaw: 'Little Red Hood,' like many folklore tales, is a singular mixture of myth and morality. In Cox's Comparative Mythology, vol. ii., p. 831, note, Little Redcap, or Little Red Riding Hood, is interpreted as 'the evening with her scarlet robe of twilight,' who is swallowed up by the wolf of darkness, the Fenris of the Edda. It appears to me that this explanation may suit the color of her cap or hood, but is at variance with the other incidents of the story. I am inclined to look upon the tale as a lunar legend, although the moon is only actually red during one portion of the year, at the harvest moon in the autumn. Red Hood is represented as wandering, like Io, who is undoubtedly the moon, through trees, the clouds, and flowers, the stars, before she reaches the place where she is intercepted by the wolf. An eclipse to untutored minds would naturally suggest the notion that some evil beast was endeavoring to devour the moon, who is afterwards rescued by the sun, the archer of the heavens, whose bow and arrow are by a common anachronism represented in the story by a gun. Though the moon is masculine in Slavonic, as in German, yet she is a lady, 'my lady Luna,' in the Croatian legend no. 53, below ['The Daughter of the King of the Vilas']. In the Norse mythology, when Loki is let loose at the end of the world, he is to 'hurry in the form of a wolf to swallow the moon ' (Cox ii., p. 200). The present masculine Slavonic word for moon, which is also that for month, mesic, or mesec, is a secondary formation, the original word having perished. In Greek and Latin the moon is always feminine.", "title": "Little Red Hood", "id": 413}
{"label": "440", "text": "But one summer Pak noticed that there were fewer fish in the pond, and that every day they seemed to be less in number. Where he used to catch a stringful in an hour, he could hardly get half that many during a whole day. What was the matter? Was he getting less skilful? Was the bait poor? Not at all! His worms were as fat, his hooks and lines in as good order, and his eyesight was as keen as ever. When Pak noticed also that the water was getting shallower, he was startled. Could it be that the pond was drying up? Things grew worse day by day until at last there were no fish. Where once sparkled the wavelets of a pond was now an arid waste of earth and stones, over which trickled hardly more than a narrow rill, which he could jump over. No fish and no pond meant no water for his rice fields. In horror at the idea of starving, or having to move away from his old home and become a pauper, Pak looked down from what had been the banks of the pond to find the cause of all this trouble. There in the mud among the pebbles he saw a bullfrog, nearly as big as an elephant, blinking at him with its huge round eyes. In a rage the farmer Pak burst out, charging the frog with cruelty in eating up all the fish and drinking up all the water, threatening starvation to man and wife. Then Pak proceeded to curse the whole line of the frog's ancestors and relatives, especially in the female line, for eight generations back, as Koreans usually do. But instead of being sorry, or showing any anger at such a scolding, the bullfrog only blinked and bowed, saying, 'Don't worry, Farmer Pak. You'll be glad of it, by and by. Besides, I want to go home with you and live in your house.' 'What! Occupy my home, you clammy reptile! No you won't,' said Pak. 'Oh! but I have news to tell you and you won't be sorry, for you see what I can do. Better take me in.' Old Pak thought it over. How should he face his wife with such a guest? But then, the frog had news to tell and that might please the old lady, who was fond of gossip. Since her husband was not very talkative, she might be willing to harbor so strange a guest. So they started down the valley. Pak shuffled along as fast as his old shins could move, but the bullfrog covered the distance in a few leaps, for his hind legs were three feet long. Arrived at his door, Mrs. Pak was horrified at the prospect of boarding such a guest. But when the husband told her that Froggie knew all about everybody and could chat interestingly by the hour, she changed her manner and bade him welcome. Indeed, she so warmed in friendliness that she gave him one of her best rooms. All the leaves, grass, and brushwood that had been gathered in the woodshed to supply the kitchen fire and house flues, was carried into the room. There it was doused with tubs of water to make a nice soft place such as bullfrogs like. After this he was fed all the worms he wanted. Then after his dinner and a nap, Mrs. Pak and Mr. Pak donned their best clothes and went in to make a formal call on their guest. Mr. Pak put on his horsehair hat and long white coat, as white as snow, which had been starched and beaten by his loving wife, until it glistened all over like hoar frost. Mr. Bullfrog was so affable and charming in conversation, besides telling so many good stories and serving up so many dainty bits of gossip, that Mrs. Pak was delighted beyond expression. Indeed, she felt almost like adopting Froggie as her son. The night passed quietly away, but when the first rays of light appeared, Froggie was out on the porch singing a most melodious tune to the rising sun. When Mr. and Mrs. Pak rose up to greet their guest and to hear his song, they were amazed to find that the music was bringing them blessings. Everything they had wished for, during their whole lives, seemed now at hand, with more undreamed of coming in troops. In the yard stood oxen, donkeys, and horses loaded with every kind of box, bale, and bundle, waiting to be unloaded, and more were coming; stout men porters appeared and began to unpack, while troops of lovely girls in shining white took from the men's hands beautiful things made of jade, gold, and silver. There were fine clothes and hats for Mr. Pak, jade-tipped hairpins, tortoise-shell and ivory combs, silk gowns, embroidered and jeweled girdles, and every sort of frocks and woman's garments for Mrs. Pak, besides inlaid cabinets, clothes racks, and wardrobes. Above all, was a polished metal mirror that looked like the full autumn moon, over which Mrs. Pak was now tempted to spend every minute of her time. Four or five of the prettiest maidens they had ever seen in all their lives danced, sang and played sweetest music. The unpacking of boxes, bales, and bundles continued. Tables of jade and finest sandalwood were spread with the richest foods and wines. Soon, under the skilful hands of carpenters and decorators, instead of oiled paper on the floors, covering old bricks and broken flat stones set over the flues, and smoky rafters and mud walls poorly papered, there rose a new house. It had elegant wide halls and large rooms with partitions made of choicest joiner work. It was furnished with growing flowers, game boards for chess, and had everything in it like a palace. As for the riches of the larder and the good things to eat daily laid on the table, no pen but a Korean's can tell of them all. In the new storehouse were piles of dried fish, edible seaweed, bags of rice, bins of millet, tubs of kim-chee made of various sorts of the pepper-hash, and Korean hot pickle in which the natives delight, to say nothing of peaches, pears, persimmons, chestnuts, honey, barley, sugar, candy, cake, and pastry, all arranged in high piles and gay colors. The old couple seemed able to eat and enjoy twice as big dinners as formerly, for all the while the adopted bullfrog was very entertaining. Mr. and Mrs. Pak laughed continually, declaring they had never heard such good stories as he told. The good wife was, however, quite equal to her guest in retailing gossip. One of her favorite subjects, of which she never tired, was the beauty and charm of Miss Peach. She was the accomplished daughter of the big Yang-ban, or nobleman, Mr. Poom, who lived in a great house, with a host of servants and retainers in the next village, and Mrs. Pak insisted there was no young woman in the world like her. It was noticed that Mr. Bullfrog was particularly interested when Miss Peach Poom was the subject of the old lady's praises. After a week of such luxury, during which Mr. and Mrs. Pak seemed to dwell in the Nirvana, or Paradise, which the good priests often talked about, Mr. Pak's full cup of joy was dashed to earth when the bullfrog informed him that he intended to marry, and that Mr. Pak must get him a wife. Still worse than that, Pak was informed by the frog that he would have no one but Miss Peach, the daughter of Poom, so renowned for her beauty and graces. At this, old Pak nearly went wild. He begged to be excused from the task, but the bullfrog was inexorable. So, after imprecating his wife's tongue, for her ever putting it into the frog's head to marry Miss Peach, he donned his fine clothes and set out to see Mr. Poom. He expected to be beaten to death for his brazen effrontery in asking a noble lady to marry a frog. Now this Mr. Poom had long been the magistrate of a district, who had squeezed much money wrongly from the poor people over whom he ruled, and having won great wealth, had retired and come back to his native place to live. Yet to keep up his old habits, he still kept a cross bench on which common people who offended him were thrown and beaten with paddles, until often they went away bleeding cripples. This man had two daughters married, but the third, the youngest and most beautiful, Miss Peach, now eighteen years old, was the only one Mr. Bullfrog would have for his bride. Arriving at the Pooms' grand mansion, Mr. Pak told of the suitor's wealth, power and fame, high position and promise, and how he had made the old couple happy. Old Poom had pricked up his ears from the first mention of riches and power, and became highly interested as Pak went on sounding the praises of his prospective son-in-law. 'And what is his name?' asked Mr. Poom. Here Pak was in a quandary. He knew that the frog family was the oldest and most numerous in the world and was famous for fine voices. He fell into a brown study for a few minutes. Then, looking up, he declared that he had so long thought of the suitor's graces and accomplishments, that he had forgotten his name and could not then recall it. So Mr. Poom, in order to help Pak out, ran over the list of famous families in Korea, reciting the names of the Kims, Sims, Mins, the Hos, Chos, Kos, Quongs, and Hongs, etc., etc., for Mr. Poom was an authority on the Korean peerage. 'It is none of these,' said Pak. 'I deeply regret that I cannot recall the name.' 'Strange,' said Mr. Poom. 'I have named all the families of any standing in the kingdom. What is his office or rank and where do his relations live?' Pak was pressed so hard by Mr. Poom's searching questions that at last he had to confess that the suitor for the beautiful maiden was not a man but a frog. 'What! Do you want me to marry my daughter to a pond-croaker? You shall suffer for thus insulting me in my own house. Slaves, bring the cross bench and give this wretch twenty blows.' Forthwith, while four men brought out the whipping bench, three others seized poor Pak, stripped off his coat, and bound him with feet and arms stretched out to the bench. Then a tall, stalwart fellow raised the huge paddle of wood to let fall with all his might on the bare flesh of the old man. But all this while the sky was darkening, and, before the first blow was given, the lightning flashed, the thunder rolled, and floods of rain fell that threatened to overwhelm house, garden, and all in a deluge. The hail, which began to pelt the cattle, was first the size of an egg and then of stones, like cannon balls. 'Hold,' cried the frightened Mr. Poom. 'I'll wait and ask further.' Thereupon the lightning and thunder ceased, the sun burst out in splendor. Mightily impress by this, Mr. Poom at last agreed to let his daughter become the bride of the frog, not telling her who her husband was to be. Within an hour, while she was getting ready, a string of fine horses and donkeys with palanquins loaded with presents for the bride and her family appeared. Besides boxes of silk dresses and perfumes, headgear and articles for a lady's boudoir, there were troops of maidens to wait on the bride. Arraying Miss Peach in the loveliest of robes, they also dressed her hair, until, what with satin puffs and frame, jade-tipped silver hairpins, rosettes, and flowers, her headgear stood over a foot high above her forehead, on which was the bride's red round spot. Then, when the happy maiden had sufficiently admired herself in the metal mirror and heard the praises of her attendant virgins, she entered the bridal palanquin -- a gorgeous mass of splendor. According to custom, her eyes were sealed shut and covered with wax, for a Korean bride sees nothing of her husband until the end of the feast, when she meets him in the bridal chamber. So to his house she was carried in great pomp and with gay attendance of brilliantly arrayed maidens. The marriage ceremony and the grand supper were happy affairs for all the guests, even though the bride, according to Korean etiquette, was as if blind, quietly and patiently waiting sightless throughout the whole joyful occasion. The actual ceremony was witnessed only by the foster parents and the bridegroom. When in the bridal chamber, the bride having unsealed her eyes, and her vision being clear, she looked up at the one she had married and found not a man, but a frog, she was furiously angry. She burst out into a protest against having such a bridegroom. Gently and in tenderest tones the bridegroom attempted first to comfort her. Then, handing her a pair of scissors, he begged her to rip open the skin along his back from shoulder to thigh, for it was very tight and he was suffering pain from it. In her bitter disappointment at being married to a frog, she seized the scissors and almost viciously began to cut from nape to waist. Her surprise was great to find what seemed to be silk underneath the speckled skin. When she had slit down two yards or so, her husband the frog stood upon his hind legs. He twisted himself about as if in a convulsion, pulled his whole speckled hide hard with his front paws, and then jumping out of his skin, stood before his bride a prince. Fair, tall, of superb figure, and gorgeously arrayed, he was the ideal of her dreams. A jeweled baldric bound his waist, embroidery of golden dragons on his shoulders and breast told of his rank, while on his head was the cap of royalty with a sparkling diamond in the centre. Yet no clothes, handsome as they were, could compare in beauty with his glorious manhood. Never had she seen so fair a mortal. Happy was the bride whose feelings were thus changed in a moment from repulsion and horror to warmest affection and strongest veneration. The next morning when, to the amazement of his foster father and mother, Mr. and Mrs. Pak, the prince presented himself and his bride at breakfast, he told the story of his life. As son of the King of the Stars he had committed some offense, in punishment for which his father condemned him to live upon the earth in the form of a frog. Furthermore he had laid upon his son the duty of performing three tasks. These must be done before he should be allowed to come back and live in Star Land. These were, to drink up all the water in the lake, to eat all the fish, and to win a human bride, the handsomest woman in the world. All the precious things which he had presented to Pak and his wife to make their old days comfortable, and the gifts sent to the bride's house before her wedding day, had come by power from the skies. Now, leaving his foster parents on earth to enjoy their gifts, he must return home to his father, taking his bride with him. Scarcely had he spoken these words than a chariot and horses, silver bright, appeared at the door of the house. Bowing low to his foster parents, and stepping in with his bride, the pair disappeared beyond the clouds. From this time forth a new double star was seen in the sky.", "title": "A Frog for a Husband", "id": 414}
{"label": "425C", "text": "Once upon a time there was a merchant who traveled about the world a great deal. On one of his journeys thieves attacked him, and they would have taken both his life and his money if a large dog had not come to his rescue and driven the thieves away. When the dog had driven the thieves away he took the merchant to his house, which was a very handsome one, and dressed his wounds and nursed him till he was well. As soon as he was able to travel the merchant began his journey home, but before starting he told the dog how grateful he was for his kindness, and asked him what reward he could offer in return, and he said he would not refuse to give the most precious thing he had. And so the merchant said to the dog, 'Will you accept a fish I have that can speak twelve languages?' 'No,' said the dog, 'I will not.' 'Or a goose that lays golden eggs?' 'No,' said the dog, 'I will not.' 'Or a mirror in which you can see what anybody is thinking about?' 'No,' said the dog, 'I will not.' 'Then what will you have?' said the merchant. 'I will have none of such presents,' said the dog; 'but let me fetch your daughter, and bring her to my house.' When the merchant heard this he was grieved, but what he had promised had to be done, so he said to the dog, 'You can come and fetch my daughter after I have been home for a week.' So at the end of the week, the dog came to the merchant's house to fetch his daughter, but when he got there he stayed outside the door, and would not go in. But the merchant's daughter did as her father told her, and came out of the house dressed for a journey and ready to go with the dog. When the dog saw her he looked pleased, and said, 'Jump on my back, and I will take you away to my house.' So she mounted on the dog's back, and away they went at a great pace, until they reached the dog's house, which was many miles off. But after she had been a month at the dog's house she began to mope and cry. 'What are you crying for?' said the dog. 'Because I want to go back to my father,' she said. The dog said, 'If you will promise me that you will not stay there more than three days I will take you there. But first of all,' said he, 'what do you call me?' 'A great, foul, small-tooth dog,' said she. 'Then,' said he, 'I will not let you go.' But she cried so pitifully that he promised again to take her home. 'But before we start,' he said, 'tell me what you call me.' 'Oh,' she said, 'your name is Sweet-as-a-Honeycomb.' 'Jump on my back,' said he, 'and I'll take you home.' So he trotted away with her on his back for forty miles, when they came to a stile. 'And what do you call me?' said he, before they got over the stile. Thinking she was safe on her way, the girl said, 'A great, foul, small-tooth dog.' But when she said this, he did not jump over the stile, but turned right round again at once, and galloped back to his own house with the girl on his back. Another week went by, and again the girl wept so bitterly that the dog promised to take her to her father's house. So the girl got on the dog's back again, and they reached the first stile, as before, and the dog stopped and said, 'And what do you call me?' 'Sweet-as-a-Honeycomb,' she replied. So the dog leaped over the stile, and they went on for twenty miles until they came to another stile. 'And what do you call me?' said the dog with a wag of his tail. She was thinking more of her father and her own house than of the dog, so she answered, 'A great, foul, small-tooth dog.' Then the dog was in a great rage, and he turned right round about, and galloped back to his own house as before. After she had cried for another week, the dog promised again to take her back to her father's house. So she mounted upon his back once more, and when they got to the first stile, the dog said, 'And what do you call me?' 'Sweet-as-a-Honeycomb,' she said. So the dog jumped over the stile, and away they went -- for now the girl made up her mind to say the most loving things she could think of -- until they reached her father's house. When they got to the door of the merchant's house, the dog said, 'And what do you call me?' Just at that moment the girl forgot the loving things she meant to say and began, 'A great --,' but the dog began to turn, and she got fast hold of the door latch, and was going to say 'foul,' when she saw how grieved the dog looked and remembered how good and patient he had been with her, so she said, 'Sweeter-than-a-Honeycomb.' When she had said this she thought the dog would have been content and have galloped away, but instead of that he suddenly stood upon his hind legs, and with his forelegs he pulled off his dog's head and tossed it high in the air. His hairy coat dropped off, and there stood the handsomest young man in the world, with the finest and smallest teeth you ever saw. Of course they were married, and lived together happily.", "title": "The Small-Tooth Dog", "id": 415}
{"label": "1137", "text": "There was once upon a time a gentleman and lady. And the lady was spinning one evening. There came to her a fairy, and they could not get rid of her; and they gave her every evening some ham to eat, and at last they got very tired of their fairy. One day the lady said to her husband, 'I cannot bear this fairy; I wish I could drive her away.' And the husband plots to dress himself up in his wife's clothes just as if it was she, and he does so. The wife goes to bed, and the husband remains in the kitchen alone, and the fairy comes as usual. And the husband was spinning. The fairy says to him, 'Good-day, madam.' 'The same to you too; sit down.' 'Before you made chirm, chirin, but now you make firgilun, fargalun.' [That is, the wife span evenly with a clear steady sound of the wheel, but the man did it unevenly.] The man replies, 'Yes, now I am tired.' As his wife used to give her ham to eat, the man offers her some also. 'Will you take your supper now?' 'Yes, if you please,' replies the fairy. He puts the frying-pan on the fire with a bit of ham. While that was cooking, and when it was red, red-hot, he throws it right into the fairy's face. The poor fairy begins to cry out, and then come thirty of her friends. 'Who has done any harm to you?' 'I, to myself; I have hurt myself.' 'If you have done it yourself, cure it yourself.' And all the fairies go off, and since then there came no more fairies to that house. This gentleman and lady were formerly so well off, but since the fairy comes no longer the house little by little goes to ruin, and their life was spent in wretchedness. If they had lived well they would have died well too.", "title": "The Fairy in the House", "id": 416}
{"label": "425C", "text": "Once upon a time there was a merchant who had three daughters. It so happened he had one day to go to strange countries to buy wares, and so he asked his daughters, 'What shall I bring you from beyond the seas?' The eldest asked for a new coat, and the next one also asked for a new coat; but the youngest one only took a sheet of paper and sketched a flower on it. 'Bring me, b\u00c3\u00a1tyushka [father], a flower like this!' So the merchant went and made a long journey to foreign kingdoms, but he could never see such a flower. So he came back home, and he saw on his way a splendid lofty palace with watchtowers, turrets, and a garden. He went a walk in the garden, and you cannot imagine how many trees he saw and flowers, every flower fairer than the other flowers. And then he looked and he saw a single one like the one which his daughter had sketched. 'Oh,' he said, 'I will tear off and bring this to my beloved daughter; evidently there is nobody here to watch me.' So he ran up and broke it off, and as soon as he had done it, in that very instant a boisterous wind arose and thunder thundered, and a fearful monster stood in front of him, a formless, winged snake with three heads. 'How dared you play the master in my garden!' cried the snake to the merchant. 'Why have you broken off a blossom?' The merchant was frightened, fell on his knees and besought pardon. 'Very well,' said the snake, 'I will forgive you, but on condition that whoever meets you first, when you reach home, you must give me for all eternity; and, if you deceive me, do not forget, nobody can ever hide himself from me. I shall find you wherever you are.' The merchant agreed to the condition and came back home. And the youngest daughter saw him from the window and ran out to meet him. Then the merchant hung his head, looked at his beloved daughter, and began to shed bitter tears. 'What is the matter with you? Why are you weeping, b\u00c3\u00a1tyushka?' He gave her the blossom and told what had befallen him. 'Do not grieve, b\u00c3\u00a1tyushka ,' said the youngest daughter. 'It is God's gift. Perhaps I shall fare well. Take me to the snake.' So the father took her away, set her in the palace, bade farewell, and set out home. Then the fair maiden, the daughter of the merchant, went in the different rooms, and beheld everywhere gold and velvet; but no one was there to be seen, not a single human soul. Time went by and went by, and the fair damsel became hungry and thought, 'Oh, if I could only have something to eat!' But before ever she had thought, in front of her stood a table, and on the table were dishes and drinks and refreshments. The only thing that was not there was birds' milk. Then she sat down to the table, drank and ate, got up, and it had all vanished. Darkness now came on, and the merchant's daughter went into the bedroom, wishing to lie down and sleep. Then a boisterous wind rustled round and the three- headed snake appeared in front of her. 'Hail, fair maiden! Put my bed outside this door!' So the fair maiden put the bed outside the door and herself lay on the bedstead. She awoke in the morning, and again in the entire house there was not a single soul to be seen. And it all went well with her. Whatever she wished for appeared on the spot. In the evening the snake flew to her and ordered, 'Now, fair maiden, put my bed next to your bedstead.' She then laid it next to her bedstead, and the night went by, and the maiden awoke, and again there was never a soul in the palace. And for the third time the snake came in the evening and said, 'Now, fair maiden, I am going to lie with you in the bedstead.' The merchant's daughter was fearfully afraid of lying on a single bed with such a formless monster. But she could not help herself, so she strengthened her heart and lay down with him. In the morning the serpent said to her, 'If you are now weary, fair maiden, go to your father and your sisters. Spend a day with them, and in the evening come back to me. But see to it that you are not late. If you are one single minute late I shall die of grief.' 'No, I shall not be late,' said the maiden, the merchant's daughter, and descended the steps; there was a barouche ready for her, and she sat down. That very instant she arrived at her father's courtyard. Then the father saw, welcomed, kissed her, and asked her, 'How has God been dealing with you, my beloved daughter ? Has it been well with you?' 'Very well, father!' And she started telling of all the wealth there was in the palace, how the snake loved her, how whatever she only thought of was in that instant fulfilled. The sisters heard, and did not know what to do out of sheer envy. Now the day was ebbing away, and the fair maiden made ready to go back, and was bidding farewell to her father and her sisters, saying, 'This is the time I must go back. I was bidden keep to my term.' But the envious sisters rubbed onions on their eyes and made as though they were weeping: 'Do not go away, sister; stay until tomorrow.' She was very sorry for her sisters, and stayed one day more. In the morning she bade farewell to them all and went to the palace. When she arrived it was as empty as before. She went into the garden, and she saw the serpent lying dead in the pond! He had thrown himself for sheer grief into the water. 'Oh, my God, what have I done!' cried out the fair maiden, and she wept bitter tears, ran. up to the pond, hauled the snake out of the water, embraced one head and kissed it with all her might. And the snake trembled, and in a minute turned into a good youth. 'I thank you, fair maiden,' he said. 'You have saved me from the greatest misfortune. I am no snake, but an enchanted prince.' Then they went back to the merchant's house, were betrothed, lived long, and lived for good and happy things. Folk-Tales (New York: E. P. Dutton and Company, 1916), pp. 283-86.

{"label": "1351", "text": "No longer ago than a week ... I had a house filled with every comfort, plenty of money, and a wife who was a miracle of beauty. One day this charming better half of myself, after having passed all the day in the bath, returned from it looking so clean, fresh, and rosy, that my head, where the hashish which I had been taking for the last hour and a half was breeding disorder, became on fire and was lost. My eyes grew intoxicated with my wife, as if I had then beheld her beauty for the first time, and my heart bounded like the holy waves of the Nile during a storm. 'Dear cousin,' I cried, for she was my cousin as well as my wife, 'how captivating you are today! I am over head and ears in love with you again!' At this instant the hashish suggested to me to divorce her immediately in order to contract a new marriage and taste again the bliss of a first union. No sooner said than done; I pronounced the prescribed phrase, and the next day I celebrated a new marriage with her. When the festivities were over, I conducted my relations and guests to the door, which, from absence of mind, I had forgotten to shut. 'Dear cousin,' said my wife to me when we were alone, 'go and shut the street door.' 'It would be strange indeed if I did,' I replied. 'Am I just made a bridegroom, clothed in silk, wearing a shawl and a dagger set with diamonds, and am I to go and shut the door? Why, my dear, you are crazy; go and shut it yourself!' 'Oh indeed!' she exclaimed; 'am I, young, robed in a satin dress, with lace and precious stones, am I to go and shut the courtyard door? No, indeed, it is you who have become crazy, and not I. Come, let us make a bargain,' she continued; 'and let the first who speaks get up and bar the door.' 'Agreed,' I replied, and straightway I became mute, and she too was silent, while we both sat down, dressed as we were in our nuptial attire, looking at each other, and seated on opposite sofas. We remained thus for one -- two -- hours. During this time thieves happening to pass by, and seeing the door open, entered and laid hold of whatever came to their hand. We heard footsteps in the house, but opened not our mouths; the robbers came even into our room, and saw us seated, motionless and indifferent to all that took place. They continued therefore their pillage, collecting together everything valuable, and even dragging away the carpets from beneath us; they then laid hands on our own persons, which they despoiled of every article worth taking, while we, in the fear of losing our wager, said not a word. Having thus cleared the house, the thieves departed quietly, but we remained on our seats, saying not a syllable. Towards morning a police officer came round on his tour of inspection, and, seeing our door opened, walked in. Having searched all the rooms and found no one, he entered the apartment where we were seated, and inquired the meaning of what he saw. Neither my wife nor I would condescend to reply. The officer became angry, and ordered our heads to be cut off. The executioner's sword was just about to perform its office, when my wife cried out, 'Sir, he is my husband, spare him!' 'Oh, oh!' I exclaimed, overjoyed and clapping my hands, 'you have lost the wager; go, shut the door.'", "title": "The Hashish Eater and His Bride", "id": 418}

{"label": "500", "text": "I see that you are fond of talks about fairies, children; and a story about a fairy and the goodwife of Kittlerumpit has just come into my mind; but I can't very well tell you now whereabouts Kittlerumpit lies. I think it is somewhere in the Debatable Ground. Anyway, I shall not pretend to know more than I do, like everybody nowadays. I wish they would remember the ballad we used to sing long ago: Mony ane sings the gerss, the gerss, And mony ane sings the corn; And mony ane clatters o' bold Robin Hood, Ne'er kent where he was born. But howsoever about Kittlerumpit. The goodman was a rambling sort of body; and he went to a fair one day, and not only never came home again, but nevermore was heard of. Some said he 'listed, and others that the tiresome press-gang snatched him up, though he was furnished with a wife and a child to boot. Alas! that wretched press-gang! They went about the country like roaring lions, seeking whom they might devour. Well do I remember how my eldest brother Sandy was all but smothered in the meal-chest, hiding from those rascals. After they were gone, we pulled him out from among the meal, puffing and crying, and as white as any corpse. My mother had to pick the meal out of his mouth with the shank of a horn spoon. Ah well, when the goodman of Kittlerumpit was gone, the goodwife was left with small means. Little resources had she, and a baby boy at her breast. All said they were sorry for her; but nobody helped her -- which is a common case, sirs. Howsoever, the goodwife had a sow, and that was her only consolation; for the sow was soon to farrow, and she hoped for a good litter. But we all know hope is fallacious. One day the woman goes to the sty to fill the sow's trough; and what does she find but the sow lying on her back, grunting and groaning, and ready to give up the ghost. I trow [trust, believe] this was a new pang to the goodwife's heart; so she sat down on the knocking stone [a stone with a hollow in it for pounding grain, so as to separate the husks from the kernels], with her bairn [child] on her knee, and cried sorer than ever she did for the loss of her own goodman. Now I premise that the cottage of Kittlerumpit was built on a brae [hillside], with a large fir wood behind it, of which you may hear more ere we go far on. So the goodwife, when she was wiping her eyes, chances to look down the brae; and what does she see but an old woman almost like a lady, coming slowly up the road. She was dressed in green, all but a short white apron and a black velvet hood, and a steeple-crowned beaver hat on her head. She had a long walking staff, as long as herself, in her hand -- the sort of staff that old men and old women helped themselves with long ago. I see no such staffs now, sirs. Ah well, when the goodwife saw the green gentlewoman near her, she rose and made a curtsy; and 'Madam,' quoth she, weeping, 'I am one of the most misfortunate women alive.' 'I don't wish to hear pipers' news and fiddlers' tales, goodwife,' quoth the green woman. 'I know you have lost your goodman -- we had worse losses at the Sheriff Muir [a common saying, in response to a complaint about a trifle]; and I know that your sow is unco [strangely, extremely] sick. Now what will you give me if I cure her?' 'Anything your ladyship's madam likes,' quoth the witless goodwife, never guessing whom she had to deal with. 'Let us wet thumbs on that bargain,' quoth the green woman; so thumbs were wetted, I warrant you; and into the sty madam marches. She looks at the sow with a long stare, and then began to mutter to herself what the goodwife couldn't well understand; but she said it sounded like Pitter patter, Holy water. Then she took out of her pocket a wee bottle, with something like oil in it; and she rubs the sow with it above the snout, behind the ears, and on the tip of the tail. 'Get up, beast,' quoth the green woman. No sooner said than done. Up jumps the sow with a grunt, and away to her trough for her breakfast. The goodwife of Kittlerumpit was a joyful goodwife now, and would have kissed the very hem of the green woman's gown-tail, but she wouldn't let 'I am not so fond of ceremonies,' quoth she; 'but now that I have righted your sick beast, let us end our settled bargain. You will not find me an unreasonable, greedy body. I like ever to do a good turn for a small reward. All I ask, and will have, is that baby boy in your bosom.' The goodwife of Kittlerumpit, who now knew her customer, gave a shrill cry like a stuck swine. The green woman was a fairy, no doubt; so she prays, and cries, and begs, and scolds; but all wouldn't do. 'You may spare your din,' quoth the fairy, 'screaming as if I was as deaf as a doornail. But this I'll let you know: I cannot, by the law we live under, take your bairn till the third day; and not then, if you can tell me my right name.' So madam goes away round the pigsty end; and the goodwife falls down in a swoon behind the knocking stone. Ah well, the goodwife of Kittlerumpit could not sleep any that night for crying, and all the next day the same, cuddling her bairn till she nearly squeezed its breath out. But the second day she thinks of taking a walk in the wood I told you of. And so with the bairn in her arms, she sets out, and goes far in among the trees, where was an old quarry hole, grown over with grass, and a bonny spring well in the middle of it. Before she came very near, she hears the whirring of a flax wheel, and a voice singing a song; so the woman creeps quietly among the bushes, and peeps over the brow of the quarry; and what does she see but the green fairy tearing away at her wheel, and singing like any precentor: Little kens [knows] our guid dame at hame, That Whuppity Stoorie is my name. 'Ha, ha!' thinks the woman, 'I've got the mason's word at last. The devil give them joy that told it!' So she went home far lighter than she came out, as you may well guess -- laughing like a madcap with the thought of cheating the old green fairy. Ah well, you must know that this goodwife was a jocose woman, and ever merry when her heart was not very sorely overladen. So she thinks to have some sport with the fairy; and at the appointed time she puts the bairn behind the knocking stone, and sits on the stone herself. Then she pulls her cap over her left ear and twists her mouth on the other side, as if she were weeping; and an ugly face she made, you may be sure. She hadn't long to wait, for up the brae climbs the green fairy, neither lame nor lazy; and long ere she got near the knocking stone she screams out, 'Goodwife of Kittlerumpit, you know well what I come for. Stand and deliver!' The woman pretends to cry harder than before, and wrings her hands, and falls on her knees with 'Och, sweet madam mistress, spare my only bairn, and take the wretched sow!' 'The devil take the sow, for my part,' quoth the fairy. 'I come not here for swine's flesh. Don't be contramawcious, huzzy, but give me the child instantly!' 'Ochone, dear lady mine,' quoth the crying goodwife; 'forgo my poor bairn, and take me myself!' 'The devil is in the daft jade,' quoth the fairy, looking like the far end of a fiddle. 'I'll bet she is clean demented. Who in all the earthly world, with half an eye in his head, would ever meddle with the likes of thee?' I trow this set up the woman of Kittlerumpit's bristle, for though she had two blear eyes and a long red nose besides, she thought herself as bonny as the best of them. So she springs off her knees, sets the top of her cap straight, and with her two hands folded before her, she makes a curtsy down to the ground, and, 'In troth, fair madam,' quoth she, 'I might have had the wit to know that the likes of me is not fit to tie the worst shoestrings of the high and mighty princess, Whuppity Stoorie.' If a flash of gunpowder had come out of the ground it couldn't have made the fairy leap higher than she did. Then down she came again plump on her shoe-heels; and whirling round, she ran down the brae, screeching for rage, like an owl chased by the witches. The goodwife of Kittlerumpit laughed till she was like to split; then she takes up her bairn, and goes into her house, singing to it all the way: A goo and a gitty, my bonny wee tyke, Ye'se noo ha'e your four-oories; Sin' we've gien Nick a bane to pyke, Wi' his wheels and his Whuppity Stoories.

{"label": "503", "text": "Not far from Dalby, Billy Beg and Tom Beg, two humpback cobblers, lived together on a lonely croft. Billy Beg was sharper and cleverer than Tom Beg, who was always at his command. One day Billy Beg gave Tom a staff, and quoth he, 'Tom Beg, go to the mountain and fetch home the white sheep.' Tom Beg took the staff and went to the mountain, but he could not find the white sheep. At last, when he was far from home, and dusk was coming on, he began to think that he had best go back. The night was fine, and stars and a small crescent moon were in the sky. No sound was to be heard but the curlew's sharp whistle. Tom was hastening home, and had almost reached Glen Rushen, when a grey mist gathered, and he lost his way. But it was not long before the mist cleared, and Tom Beg found himself in a green glen such as he had never seen before, though he thought he knew every glen within five miles of him, for he was born and reared in the neighborhood. He was marveling and wondering where he could be, when he heard a far-away sound drawing nearer to him. 'Aw,' said he to himself, 'there's more than myself afoot on the mountains tonight; I'll have company.' The sound grew louder. First, it was like the humming of bees, then like the rushing of Glen Meay waterfall, and last it was like the marching and the murmur of a crowd. It was the fairy host. Of a sudden the glen was full of fine horses and of little people riding on them, with the lights on their red caps shining like the stars above and making the night as bright as day. There was the blowing of horns, the waving of flags, the playing of music, and the barking of many little dogs. Tom Beg thought that he had never seen anything so splendid as all he saw there. In the midst of the drilling and dancing and singing one of them spied Tom, and then Tom saw coming towards him the grandest little man he had ever set eyes upon, dressed in gold and silver, and silk shining like a raven's wing. 'It is a bad time you have chosen to come this way,' said the little man, who was the king. 'Yes; but it is not here that I'm wishing to be though,' said Tom. Then said the king, 'Are you one of us tonight, Tom?' 'I am surely,' said Tom. 'Then,' said the king, 'it will be your duty to take the password. You must stand at the foot of the glen, and as each regiment goes by, you must take the password: it is 'Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.'' 'I'll do that with a heart and a half,' said Tom. At daybreak the fiddlers took up their fiddles; the Fairy army set itself in order; the fiddlers played before them out of the glen; and sweet that music was. Each regiment gave the password to Tom as it went by, 'Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday'; and last of all came the king, and he, too, gave it, 'Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.' Then he called in Manx to one of his men, 'Take the hump from this fellow's back,' and before the words were out of his mouth the hump was whisked off Tom Beg's back and thrown into the hedge. How proud now was Tom, who so found himself the straightest man in the Isle of Man! He went down the mountain and came home early in the morning with light heart and eager step. Billy Beg wondered greatly when he saw Tom Beg so straight and strong, and when Tom Beg had rested and refreshed himself he told his story how he had met the Fairies who came every night to Glen Rushen to drill. The next night Billy Beg set off along the mountain road and came at last to the green glen. About midnight he heard the trampling of horses, the lashing of whips, the barking of dogs, and a great hullabaloo, and, behold, the Fairies and their king, their dogs and their horses, all at drill in the glen as Tom Beg had said. When they saw the humpback they all stopped, and one came forward and very crossly asked his business. 'I am one of Yourselves for the night, and should be glad to do you some service,' said Billy Beg. So he was set to take the password, 'Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.' And at daybreak the King said, 'It's time for us to be off,' and up came regiment after regiment giving Billy Beg the password, 'Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.' Last of all came the king with his men. and gave the password also, 'Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.' 'AND SUNDAY,' says Billy Beg, thinking himself clever. Then there was a great outcry. 'Get the hump that was taken off that fellow's back last night and put it on this man's back,' said the king, with flashing eyes, pointing to the hump that lay under the hedge. Before the words were well out of his mouth the hump was clapped onto Billy Beg's back. 'Now,' said the King, 'be off, and if ever I find you here again, I will clap another hump on to your front!' And on that they all marched away with one great shout, and left poor Billy Beg standing where they had found him, with a hump growing on each shoulder. And he came home next day dragging one foot after another, with a wizened face and as cross as two sticks, with his two humps on his back, and if they are not off they are there still.", "title": "Billy Beg, Tom Beg, and the Fairies", "id": 422}

'Well thought of,' said the others; 'we will go there.' After walking a league, they heard a voice crying: 'Bah, bah.' They saw a great sheep, and were afraid, and ran away, saying: 'Fly, fly, it is going to attack us.' But the sheep cried to them: 'Don't be afraid. Where are you going?' 'To Benibaire's house, to steal three flasks of oil,' they answered. 'Would you like me to go too?' said the sheep. 'Oh, yes,' they replied. They went another league, and heard a voice that said: 'Mieaou, mieaou.' And they saw a very great black cat, and were frightened, and ran away, saying: 'Fly, fly, it is going to scratch us.' But the cat cried to them: 'Don't be frightened, I won't scratch you. Where are you going?' 'To Benibaire's house, to steal three flasks of oil,' they replied. 'Would you like me to go too?' 'Oh, do come,' answered the kids. They went a league farther, and heard a voice crowing: 'Cock-a-doodle-doo.'

They went another league, and arrived at Benibaire's house; and as it was night, the door was closed. 'How shall we get in?' said the little kids. To which the cock replied: 'I will fly on to the roof, and get down the chimney.' And he did so, and opened the door to them all. They entered the house, and said, 'Where shall we hide ourselves?' The cock replied: 'I have my place already; I will go into the chimney.' The cat hid in the cinders; the needle put itself into the towel, and the sheep got behind the door. Then the kids went to the jars to draw the oil. Whilst they were drawing it they let the funnel fall, and this aroused Benibaire, who said: 'Oh, Lord! thieves have got into my house.' He got up and went to the chimney, and looked up the flue, to see if it were day. Whilst he was looking up, the cock dropped some lime into his eyes and blinded him. He ran to the towel to wipe his face, and as the needle was there, it pricked him; he went to kindle a fire by the eye of the cat in the ashes, and she darted out at him and scratched him; he went flying to the door, and when he got there the sheep gave him a push and he rolled into the street; he went to the mill, and fell into the river, and was drowned, and the three kids remained masters of the house, and had a very good time of it.", "title": "Benibaire", "id": 423}
{"label": "440", "text": "One fine evening a young princess went into a wood, and sat down by the side of a cool spring of water. She had a golden ball in her hand, which was her favorite plaything, and she amused herself with tossing it into the air and catching it again as it fell. After a time she threw it up so high that when she stretched out her hand to catch it, the ball bounded away and rolled along upon the ground, till at last it fell into the spring. The princess looked into the spring after her ball; but it was very deep, so deep that she could not see the bottom of it. Then she began to lament her loss, and said, 'Alas! If I could only get my ball again, I would give all my fine clothes and jewels, and everything that I have in the world.' Whilst she was speaking a frog put its head out of the water and said, 'Princess, why do you weep so bitterly?' 'Alas! said she, 'What can you do for me, you nasty frog? My golden ball has fallen into the spring.' The frog said, 'I want not your pearls and jewels and fine clothes; but if you will love me and let me live with you, and eat from your little golden plate, and sleep upon your little bed, I will bring you your ball again.' 'What nonsense,' thought the princess, 'This silly frog is talking! He can never get out of the well. However, he may be able to get my ball for me; and therefore I will promise him what he asks.' So she said to the frog, 'Well, if you will bring me my ball, I promise to do all you require.' Then the frog put his head down, and dived deep under the water; and after a little while he came up again with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the ground. As soon as the young princess saw her ball, she ran to pick it up, and was so overjoyed to have it in her hand again, that she never thought of the frog, but ran home with it as fast as she could. The frog called after her, 'Stay, princess, and take me with you as you promised.' But she did not stop to hear a word. The next day, just as the princess had sat down to dinner, she heard a strange noise, tap-tap, as if somebody was coming up the marble staircase. And soon afterwards something knocked gently at the door, and said, Then the princess ran to the door and opened it, and there she saw the frog, whom she had quite forgotten. She was terribly frightened, and shutting the door as fast as she could, came back to her seat. The king, her father, asked her what had frightened her. 'There is a nasty frog,' said she, 'at the door, who lifted my ball out of the spring this morning. I promised him that he should live with me here, thinking that he could never get out of the spring; but there he is at the door and wants to come in!' While she was speaking the frog knocked again at the door, and said, The king said to the young princess, 'As you have made a promise, you must keep it. So go and let him in.' She did so, and the frog hopped into the room, and came up close to the table. 'Pray lift me upon a chair,' said he to the princess, 'and let me sit next to you.' As soon as she had done this, the frog said, 'Put your plate closer to me that I may eat out of it.' This she did. And when he had eaten as much as he could, he said, 'Now I am tired. Carry me upstairs and put me into your little bed.' And the princess took him up in her hand and put him upon the pillow of her own little bed, where he slept all night long. As soon as it was light he jumped up, hopped downstairs, and went out of the house. 'Now,' thought the princess, 'he is gone, and I shall be troubled with him no more.' But she was mistaken; for when night came again, she heard the same tapping at the door, and when she opened it, the frog came in and slept upon her pillow as before till the morning broke. And the third night he did the same; but when the princess awoke on the following morning, she was astonished to see, instead of the frog, a handsome prince gazing on her with the most beautiful eyes that ever were seen, and standing at the head of her bed. He told her that he had been enchanted by a malicious fairy, who had changed him into the form of a frog, in which he was fated to remain till some princess should take him out of the spring and let him sleep upon her bed for three nights. 'You,' said the prince, 'have broken this cruel charm, and now I have nothing to wish for but that you should go with me into my father's kingdom, where I will marry you, and love you as long as you live.' The young princess, you may be sure, was not long in giving her consent; and as they spoke a splendid carriage drove up with eight beautiful horses decked with plumes of feathers and golden harness, and behind rode the prince's servant, the faithful Henry, who had bewailed the misfortune of his dear master so long and bitterly that his heart had well nigh burst. Then all set out full of joy for the prince's kingdom, where they arrived safely, and lived happily a great many years. Edgar Taylor, the translator of 'The Frog King,' departs from his source in substantial ways. Not only does he change the title, but he totally revises the ending, replacing the Grimms' violent resolution with one of passivity. It appears that, in his judgment, the English readers of the 1820's, unlike their German counterparts, would not accept a heroine who throws her frisky bed companion against the wall.", "title": "The Frog Prince (Taylor)", "id": 424}
{"label": "1191", "text": "The highway between Pateley Bridge and Grassington crosses, in the parish of Burnsall, the deep dell in which runs the small river Dibb, or Dibble, by a bridge known in legend as the Devil's Bridge. It might reasonably be supposed that Deep-Dell Bridge, or Dibble Bridge, was the correct and desirable designation, but legend and local tradition will by no means have it so, and account for the less pleasant name in the following manner. In the days when Fountain's Abbey was in its prime, a shoemaker and small tenant of part of the abbey lands, named Ralph Calvert, resided at Thorp-sub-Montem, and journeyed twice a year along this road to pay his rent to the abbot, dispose of the fruits of his six months' handiwork, and return the shoes entrusted to him on his previous visit for repair, and bring back with him, on his return, a bag well filled with others that needed his attention. The night before setting out on one of these occasions, he had a fearful dream, in which he struggled with the devil, who, in this wild, rocky ravine, amid unpleasant surroundings, endeavored to thrust Ralph into a bag, similar to the one in which he carried his stock-in-trade. This he and his wife feared boded no good. In the morning, however, he started on his journey, and duly reached the abbey, assisted at the service, did his business with the abbot and brethren, and then started, with his well filled bag, on his return homewards. When he arrived near home, in the deep ravine, where on previous occasions he had found but a small brook which he could easily ford, he now found a mountain torrent, through which he only with difficulty and some danger made his way. Having accomplished the passage, he sat down to rest and to dry his wetted garments. As he sat and contemplated the place, he could not but recall how exactly it corresponded with the spot seen in his dream, and at which the author of evil had tried to bag him. Dwelling on this brought anything but pleasant thoughts, and to drive them away, and to divert his mind, he struck up a familiar song, in which the name of the enemy finds frequent mention, and the refrain of which was: He was unaware of any presence but his own. But, to his alarm, another voice than his added a further line: Ralph thought of his dream. Then he fancied he saw the shadow of a man on the road. Then from a projecting corner of a rock he heard a voice reading over a list of delinquents in the neighborhood, with whom he must remonstrate -- Ralph's own name among the rest. Not to be caught eavesdropping, Ralph feigned sleep. But after a time was aroused by the stranger, and a long conversation ensued, the upshot of which was, after they had entered into a compact of friendship, that Satan informed the shoemaker who he was and inquired of the alarmed man if there was anything that he could do for him. Ralph looked at the swollen torrent and thought of the danger he had lately incurred in crossing it, and of his future journeys that way to the abbey. And then he said, 'I have heard that you are an able architect. I should wish you to build a bridge across this stream. I know you can do it.' At nightfall Ralph reached his home at Thorpe, and related his adventure to his wife, and added, 'In spite of all that is said against him, the Evil One is an honest gentleman, and I have made him promise to build a bridge at the Gill Ford on the road to Pateley. If he fulfils his promise, St. Crispin bless him.' The news of Ralph's adventure and of the promise soon spread among the neighbors, and he had no small amount of village chaff and ridicule to meet before the eventful Saturday -- the fourth day -- arrived. At last it came. Accompanied by thirty or forty of the villagers, Ralph made his way to the dell, where, on arrival, picture their astonishment at the sight! Lo, a beautiful and substantial bridge spanned the abyss! Surveyor, and mason, and priest pronounced it to be perfect. The latter sprinkled it with holy water, caused a cross to be placed at each approach to it, and then declared it to be safe for all Christian people to use. So it remained until the Puritan Minister of Pateley, in the time of the Commonwealth, discerning the story to be a Popish legend, caused the protecting crosses to be removed as idolatrous. After that time, neither the original builder nor any other person seems to have thought fit to keep the bridge in 'good and tenantable' repair, and in time it fell into so disreputable and dangerous a condition, that the liberal and almost magic-working native of the parish -- Sir William Craven, Lord Mayor of London in the reign of the 1st James -- took the matter in hand and built upon the old foundations a more terrestrial, but not less substantial and enduring, structure. Still men call it the Devil's Bridge.", "title": "The Devil's Bridge (Parkinson121)", "id": 425}
{"label": "480", "text": "Some time passed, and his wife died. He was unhappy before, but now a greater misfortune had befallen him. He grieved and grieved, and at last he said to himself, 'I will go and take another wife; she will mind the house, and tend my orphan child.' So he arose and took a second wife, but this wife brought with her a daughter of her own. When this woman came into her husband's house and saw his child, she was angry in heart. She treated Little Rag-Girl badly. She petted her own daughter, but scolded her stepdaughter, and tried to get rid of her. Every day she gave her a piece of badly cooked bread, and sent her out to watch the cow, saying, 'Here is a loaf; eat of it, give to every wayfarer, and bring the loaf home whole.' The girl went, and felt very miserable. Once she was sitting sadly in the field, and began to weep bitterly. The cow listened, and then opened its mouth, and said, 'Why are you weeping? What troubles you?' The girl told her sad tale. The cow said, 'In one of my horns is honey, and in the other is butter, which you can take if you want to, so why be unhappy?' The girl took the butter and the honey, and in a short time she grew plump. When the stepmother noticed this she did not know what to do for rage. She rose, and after that every day she gave her a basket of wool with her; this wool was to be spun and brought home in the evening finished. The stepmother wished to tire the girl out with toil, so that she should grow thin and ugly. Once when Little Rag-Girl was tending the cow, it ran away onto a roof. Looking inside she saw an old woman seated, and said to her, 'Good mother, will you give me my spindle?' The old dame replied, 'I am not able, my child, come and take it yourself.' The old woman was a devi. The girl went in and was lifting up her spindle, when the old dame called out, 'Daughter, daughter, come and look at my head a moment. I am almost eaten up.' The girl came and looked at her head. She was filled with horror; all the worms in the earth seemed to be crawling there. The little girl stroked her head and removed some, and then said, 'You have a clean head. Why should I look at it?' This conduct pleased the old woman very much, and she said, 'When you leave here, go along such and such a road, and in a certain place you will see three springs -- one white, one black, and one yellow. Pass by the white and black, and put your head in the yellow and rinse it with your hands.' The girl did this. She went on her way, and came to the three springs. She passed by the white and black, and bathed her head with her hands in the yellow fountain. When she looked up she saw that her hair was quite golden, and her hands, too, shone like gold. In the evening, when she went home, her stepmother was filled with fury. After this she sent her own daughter with the cow. Perhaps the same good fortune would visit her! So Little Rag-Girl stayed at home while her stepsister drove out the cow. Once more the cow ran onto the roof. The girl pursued it, and her spindle fell down. She looked in, and seeing the devi woman, called out, 'Dog of an old woman! Here! Come and give me my spindle!' The old woman replied, 'I am not able, child, come and take it yourself.' When the girl came near, the old woman said, 'Come, child, and look at my head.' The girl came and looked at her head, and cried out, 'Ugh! What a horrid head you have! You are a disgusting old woman!' The old woman said, 'I thank you, my child; when you go on your way you will see a yellow, a white, and a black spring. Pass by the yellow and the white springs, and rinse your head with your hands in the black one.' The girl did this. She passed by the yellow and white springs, and bathed her head in the black one. When she looked at herself she was black as an African, and on her head there was a horn. She cut it off again and again, but it grew larger and larger. She went home and complained to her mother, who was almost frenzied, but there was no help for it. Her mother said to herself, 'This is all the cow's fault, so it shall be killed.' This cow knew the future. When it learned that it was to be killed, it went to Little Rag-Girl and said, 'When I am dead, gather my bones together and bury them in the earth. When you are in trouble come to my grave, and cry aloud, 'Bring my steed and my royal robes!'' Little Rag-Girl did exactly as the cow had told her. When it was dead she took its bones and buried them in the earth. After this, some time passed. One holiday the stepmother took her daughter, and they went to church. She placed a trough in front of Little Rag-Girl, spread a large measure of millet in the courtyard, and said, 'Before we come home from church fill this trough with tears, and gather up this millet, so that not one grain is left.' Then they went to church. Little Rag-Girl sat down and began to weep. While she was crying a neighbor came in a said, 'Why are you in tears? What is the matter?' The little girl told her tale. The woman brought all the brood hens and chicken, and they picked up every grain of millet, then she put a lump of salt in the trough and poured water over it. 'There, child,' said she, 'there are your tears! Now go and enjoy yourself.' Little Rag-Girl then thought of the cow. She went to its grave and called out, 'Bring me my steed and my royal robes!' There appeared at once a horse and beautiful clothes. Little Rag-Girl put on the garments, mounted the horse, and went to the church. There all the folk began to stare at her. They were amazed at her grandeur. Her stepsister whispered to her mother when she saw her, 'This girl is very much like our Little Rag-Girl!' Her mother smiled scornfully and said, 'Who would give that sun darkener such robes?' Little Rag-Girl left the church before anyone else; she changed her clothes in time to appear before her stepmother in rags. On the way home, as she was leaping over a stream, in her haste she let her slipper fall in. A long time passed. Once when the king's horses were drinking water in this stream, they saw the shining slipper and were so afraid that they would drink no more water. The king was told that there was something shining in the stream, and that the horses were afraid. The king commanded his divers to find out what it was. They found the golden slipper, and presented it to the king. When he saw it, he commanded his viziers, saying, 'Go and seek the owner of this slipper, for I will wed none but her.' His viziers sought the maiden, but they could find no one whom the slipper would fit. Little Rag-Girl's mother heard this, adorned her daughter, and placed her on a throne. Then she went and told the king that she had a daughter whose foot he might look at. It was exactly the model for the shoe. She put Little Rag-Girl in a corner, with a big basket over her. When the king came into the house he sat down on the basket, in order to try on the slipper. Little Rag-Girl took a needle and pricked the king from under the basket. He jumped up, stinging with pain, and asked the stepmother what she had under the basket. The stepmother replied, 'It is only a turkey I have there.' The king sat down on the basket again, and Little Rag-Girl again stuck the needle into him. The king jumped up, and cried out, 'Lift the basket. I will see underneath!' The stepmother pleaded with him, saying, 'Do not blame me, your majesty, it is only a turkey, and it will run away.' But the king would not listen to her pleas. He lifted the basket up, and Little Rag-Girl came forth, and said, 'This slipper is mine, and fits me well.' She sat down, and the king found that it was indeed a perfect fit. Little Rag-Girl became the king's wife, and her shameless stepmother was left with a dry throat.", "title": "Conkiajgharuna, the Little Rag-Girl", "id": 426}
{"label": "155", "text": "That minute he heard a cry, and someone called, 'Oh, good man, take pity on me! Roll off the stone and save my life. Free me, and I will pay you as the world pays best!' The peasant rolled the stone away, and out of the hole a great snake crawled, wound himself into a spiral, raised up his head, and said, 'Know, man, that I am Yaza! Get ready, you must die.' The peasant was terribly frightened, and lamenting he reproached the snake with ingratitude. 'Didn't you call for help? Haven't I saved your life?' asked he. 'Of course,' replied the snake, 'but I am only doing what I promised; I am paying you as the world pays best.' After a long discussion the snake agreed to let another settle the dispute, and they went together in search of a judge. After a while they came to where an old dog was tied to a fence. 'How are you, faithful guardian of a house?' asked the peasant. 'As you see,' replied the dog. 'Be so kind as to be our judge; we have a dispute.' And the peasant told the whole story. 'Wasn't it so and so?' asked he, turning to the snake. 'It was,' answered the snake. The dog thought a while, then said to the man, 'My friend, you must die, for this is just how the world pays best. When I was young I was my master's favorite. He wore the skins of the wolves and foxes which I caught; I guarded his house from thieves. My master was fond of me. When offered a carriage and horses he refused to sell me. But now, when I am old and weak and can neither run nor bark, he has led me out here and tied me to the fence to stay till some man kills me for my skin. This is the world's reward.' The peasant, seeing that he had lost his case, begged to look for another judge. The snake consented and they went through forests and across fields till they came to an old half-starved horse. His head was hanging down, his sides had fallen in, and he was covered with flies which he had not strength to drive away. 'How are you, noble beast?' asked the peasant. 'As you see,' replied the horse. The peasant told him the story and begged him to decide for them. The horse listened patiently to the man's complaint, then decided in favor of the snake, saying, 'This is the world's reward. 'When I was young,' said he, 'I had every comfort. When I was led out of the stable every one admired me. I carried my master to war. More than once, by my swiftness, I saved his life and helped him to fame. Two men cared for me; they curried me twice each day and gave me the best of oats and hay. My stable was like a parlor. In summer they covered me with a net that flies might not bite me. My master wouldn't have sold me for a whole village. But when I grew old he starved me, didn't even give me straw to eat. And now he has led me out to this barren field to be killed by the wolves. This is how the world pays best.' 'What more do you want, man?' asked the snake. The peasant begged the snake to let him try a third and last judge. He consented and they went on till at the edge of a forest they saw a fox, running along. 'Oh, Master Fox, wait and be our judge!' called the peasant. 'We have a question to decide.' The fox, a cunning fellow, listened to the story, then winked to the peasant, and whispered, aside, 'If you will give me all of your hens I will help you out of your trouble.' 'What are hens!' said the man. 'I will give you the geese too, and if need be all I have in the world.' The fox, pretending to be an impartial judge, said, 'This is an important case: one of life and death. The first who judged, judged lightly. In justice the case can only be decided on the spot where everything took place. We will go there.' When they came to the place, the fox said, 'We must begin at the beginning. Do you, man, sit down on the stone, and you, snake, crawl into the hole where you were lying.' When they had done as he told them, and the snake was back in the hole, he winked at the man, and said, 'Roll the stone over, quickly.' The peasant didn't wait to be told twice. When the hole was covered, and the snake couldn't get out, the peasant thanked the fox for salvation from death. The fox answered, 'But do not forget that I have earned the hens. Tomorrow before daylight, I will come for my breakfast.' The peasant went home as delighted as if he had been born a second time. He told his wife what had happened, praised the wisdom of the fox, and added that he had promised him all the hens, and that the next morning he would come for them. The woman was glad that her husband was saved, but she was very sorry to lose her hens. The next morning, early, she went to the window and seeing a fox in the yard she called to her husband, 'Do you hear, old man? There is a fox in the yard!' 'Oh, that is the fox that saved me. He has come for the hens!' 'Just as if I were crazy enough to give him my hens!' cried the woman. 'The Lord be praised that you are alive; but take the gun and kill the fox. You will get good money for his pelt.' The peasant obeyed his wife. He took the gun and firing from the window killed the fox.

Where for counters, pins, and points, And cherry stones did play, Till he amongst the gamesters young Had lost his stock away. Yet he could not the same renew, When as most nimbly he, Would dive into their cherry bags, So their partakers be. Unseen or felt by any one, Until a scholar shut The nimble youth into a box, Wherein his pins were put. Of whom to be reveng'd he took, In mirth and pleasant game, Black pots and glasses, which he hung Upon a light sun beam. The other boys did do the same, In pieces tore him quite, For which they were severely whipt, For which he laugh'd outright. And so Tom Thumb restrained was From this his sport and play, And by his mother after that Compell'd at home to stay. Where about Christmas time His mother a hog had kill'd, And Tom would see the pudding made, For fear it fhould be spoil'd. Of Tom's falling into the Pudding Bowl, and his Escape out of the Tinker's Budget He set the candle for to light Upon the pudding bowl, Of which there is unto this day A pretty story told. For Tom fell in, and could not be For some time after found, For in the blood and batter he Was lost, and almost drown'd. And she not knowing of the same, Directly after that, Into the pudding stir'd her son, Instead of minced fat, Now this pudding of the largest size, Into the kettle thrown, Made all the rest to jump about, As with a whirlwind blown. Bue it so tumbled up and down, Within the liquor there, As if the devil had been boil'd, Such was the mother's fear. That up she took the pudding strait, And gave it at the door Unto a tinker, which from thence He in his budget bore. But as the Tinker climb'd the stile, He chanc'd to let a crack, How! good old man, cry'd Tom Thumb, Still hanging at his back. At which the tinker began to run, He would no longer stay, But cast both bag and pudding too Over the hedge way. From whence poor Tom got loose at last, He home return'd again, And from great dangers long In safety did remain. Until fuch time his mother went A milking of her kine, Where Tom unto a thistle fast She linked with a line. Of Tom Thumb's being tied to a Thistle, and of his Mother's Cow eating him up; with his strange Deliverance out of the Cow's Belly A thread that held him to the same, For fear the blustring wind Would blow him thence, so as she might Her son in safety find. But mark the hap, a cow came by, And up the thistle eat, Poor Tom withal, who on a dock, Was made the red cow's meat. But being miss'd his mother went, Calling him every where, Where art thou Tom, where art thou? Quoth he, here mother, here; In the red cow's belly here, Your son is swallow'd up, All which within her fearful heart Much woeful dolar put. Mean time the cow was troubl'd sore In this her rumbling womb, Had backwards cast Tom Thumb. Now all besmeared as he was, His mother took him up, Now home to bear him hence, poor lad, She in her apron put. Tom Thumb is carried away by a Raven, and swallowed up by a Giant, with several other strange Things that befel him. Now after this, in sowing time, His father would him have Into the field to drive the plough And therewithal him gave A whip made of a barley straw, For to drive the cattle on, There in a furrow'd land new sown, Poor Tom was lost and gone. Now by a raven of great strength Away poor Tom was born, And carried in a carrion's beak, Just like a grain of corn, Unto a giant's castle top, Whereon he let him fall, And soon the giant swallow'd up His body, cloaths, and all. But in his belly did Tom Thumb So great a rumbling make, That neither night nor day he could The smallest quiet take, Until the giant him had spew'd Full three miles in the sea, Where a large fish soon took him up, And bore him thence away. The lusty fish was after caught, So to King Arthur sent, Where Tom was kept, being a dwarf, Until his time was spent. Long time he liv'd in jollity, Beloved of the court, And none like Tom was so esteem'd Among the better sort. Tom Thumb, by the Command of King Arthur, dances a Galliard upon the Queen's left Hand. Among the deeds of courtship done His highness did command, That he should dance a galliard brave, Upon the queen's left hand. All which he did, and for the same, Our king his signet gave, Which Tom about his middle wore, Long time a girdle brave. Behold it was a rich reward, And given by the King, Which to his praise and worthiness Did lasting honour bring. For while he lived in the court, His pleasant pranks were seen, And he, according to report, Was favour'd by the queen. Tom rides a hunting with the King. Now after that the King he would Abroad for pleasure go, Yet still Tom Thumb must be with him, Plac'd on his saddle bow. And on a time when as it rain'd, Tom Thumb most nimbly crept Into his button-hole, where He in his bosom slept. And being near his Highness's heart, Did crave a wealthy boon, A noble gift, the which the King Commanded should be done. For to relieve his father's wants, And mother's, being old, It was as much of silver coin As well his arms could hold. And so away goes lusty Tom, With three pence at his back, A heavy burthen, which did make His very bones to crack. So travelling two days and nights, In labour and great pain, He came unto the house whereat His parents did remain.. Which was but half a mile in space From good King Arthur's court, All this in eight and forty hours He went in weary sort. But coming to his father's door, He there such entrance had, As made his both rejoice, And he thereat was glad. So his mother in her apron put Her gentle son in haste, And by the fire side within A wallnut shell him plac'd. And then they feasted him three days Upon a hazel nut, On which he rioted long, And them to charges put. And thereupon grew wonderous sick, In eating so much meat, That was sufficient for a month For this great man to eat. So when his business call'd him forth, King Arthur's court to see, From which no longer Tom, 'tis said. He could a stranger be. But a few moist April drops, That settled on the way, His long and weary journey Did hinder and so stay, Until this careful mother took A birding trunk in sport, And with one blaft blew this her son Into King Arthur's court. Of Tom's running a Tilt, with other Exercises performed by him. Thus he at tilt and tournament Was entertained so, That all the rest of Arthur's knights Did him much pleasure shew. And good Sir Launcelot du Lake, Sir Tristram and Sir Guy, Yet none compar'd to brave Tom Thumb, In acts of cavalry In honour of which noble day, And for his Lady's sake, A challenge in King Arthur's court Tom Thumb did bravely make. Gainst whom the noble knights did run, Sir Kihon and the rest, But yet Tom Thumb with all his might Did bear away the best. Sir Launcelot du Lake at last In manly sort came in, So with this stout and hardy knight A battle did begin. Which made the courtiers all aghaft, For there this valiant man, Thro' Lancelot's steed, before them all, With nimble manner ran. Yea horse and all, with spear and shield, As hardly e'er was seen, Bur only by King Arthur's self, And his beloved Queen, Who from her finger took a ring, Thro' which he did make away. Not touching it in simple sort, As it had been in play. He also cleft the smallest hair, From the fair lady's head, From hurting her whose even hand Him lasting honours bred. Such were his deeds, and noble acts In Arthur's court were shewn, The like in all the world beside Before was never seen. Tom is taken Sick, and dies. Thus at his sports Tom toil'd himself, That he a Sickness took, Thro' all which manly exercise His strength had him forsook. Where lying on a bed sore sick, King Arthur's doctors came, By cunning skill and physic's art, To ease and cure the same. He being both slender and tall, The cunning doctors took A fine perspective glass, with which They took a careful look, Into his sickly body down, And there they saw that death Stood ready in his wasted guts, To seize his vital breath. His arms and legs consum'd as small As was a spider's web, Thro' which his dying hours flew, And all his limbs were dead. His face no bigger than an ant's, Which hardly could be seen, The loss of this renowned knight Much griev'd the king and Queen. And so with grief and quietness He left the earth below, And up into the fairy land, His fading ghost did go. Where the fairy queen receiv'd With heavy mournful cheer, The body of this valiant Knight, Whom she esteem'd so dear. For with her flying nymphs in green, She took him from his bed, With music sweet and melody, As soon as life was fled. For whom King Arthur and his Knights Full forty years did mourn, In the remembrance of his name, That strangely thus was born. He built a tomb of marble grey, And year by year did come, To celebrate the mournful day, And burial of Tom Thumb. Whose fame lives here in England still, Amongst the country sort, Of whom the wives and children dear Tell pretty tales in sport. But here's a wonder come at last, Which some will scarce believe, After two hundred years were past, He did new life receive. The fair Queen she lov'd him so, As you shall understand, That once again she let him go Down from the fairy land. The very time that he return'd Unto the court again, It was, as we are well assur'd, In good King Arthur's reign. Where in the presence of the King He many wonders wrought, Recited in the Second Part, Which now is to be bought In Long-lane, Smithfield, They sell fine Histories many, With pleasant tales as e'er were told, For purchase of One Penny.

One day Nanbush was walking along the shore, when he saw a pike in the water, which he decided to catch. He jumped in but missed the fish, so he thought he would wash his hands and make some soup. He went on and saw someone else in the water. He called out, 'Well, my brother, is this where you live?' 'Yes,' the stranger answered, 'This is where I live, and I am the chief.' Whereupon Nanbush said, 'I never saw you before.' Then the Turtle-chief said, 'Tomorrow I expect to take part in a race and I am betting my life on it.' Nanbush asked him, 'Whom are you going to race?' 'I am going to race an elk,' said the chief, 'and now I am going to get ready.' He placed other turtles around the lake and told them what to do, and then he was ready for the race. Nanbush saw the elk the next morning, and it looked very fat and good to eat. He said to himself, 'The Turtle will probably give a feast after the race. I will be there and see who will win.' Soon they were ready to start. By means of his brother turtles, the chief won and the elk was beaten. Then the Turtle killed the elk. Nanbush stayed, hoping to get some of this meat, but the Turtle said, 'I am going to feed all my children and there will not be enough meat to go around.' Whereupon Nanbush proposed that he should carry the meat home for them. The Turtle agreed to this and went home to wait for Nanbush. Nanbush, however, took the meat to his own home and there ate it all.", "title": "Turtle's Race", "id": 431}
{"label": "571B", "text": "Hans was the son of a poor widow. When he was young, the children of wealthy peasants teased him because he was modest and reserved and never repaid evil with evil. Soon everyone in the village called him Stupid Hans. Later he was hired as a farmhand by a wealthy landowner. His master was pleased with his good work, and some time later he proposed that Hans should work an additional seven years, after which he would receive the landowner's daughter as a wife. Hans had long been attracted to the good-looking girl, so he joyfully agreed to the arrangement, then worked with renewed energy and loyalty. Following his example, the other servants worked all the more diligently, and the estate prospered greatly. The landowner's added wealth swelled him with pride, although he owed it almost entirely to his faithful servant Hans, and he soon forgot his promise. At the conclusion of seven years he arranged for his daughter to marry a neighboring wealthy landowner. This breach of promise angered Hans greatly, but he said nothing, waiting instead for the wedding day when he would avenge himself. It happened that he had come into possession of a magic charm in the following manner: Once when he was hauling wood from the forest his wagon-shaft had broken. He fashioned a new one but was unable to attach it to the wagon. After numerous unsuccessful attempts he was about to give up when he heard a small voice behind him saying, 'Hold fast, hold fast!' and the shaft immediately attached itself to the wagon. Hans looked about with amazement, but no one was to be seen. Afterward Hans experimented often with this magical charm, and he now planned to use it for his revenge. The wedding day arrived with a great celebration. The father of the bride spared no expense to make himself look important to his neighbors. In the evening the young couple slipped away from the festivities and retired to their bedroom. Hans followed them without being seen. The young bridegroom, suspecting nothing, embraced his blushing bride, when Hans softly spoke out, 'Hold fast, hold fast!' The young couple could not separate themselves from his embrace. Hans retired quietly to his own bed in the stall. The parents did not discover the young couple's plight until the next morning. They cried out miserably, then sent Hans to the pastor, thinking that through prayer the pastor could cast out the devil who held the poor ones captive. It was a rainy day, and Hans was walking behind the pastor, who lifted his robe whenever he had to wade through a puddle. At such a moment Hans whispered a mighty 'Hold fast, hold fast!' and the pastor was unable to release his robe, but had to continue holding it high. At the house he said a number of prayers, but they did not help, so Hans was sent to fetch a cunning-woman. Their way back led them through a broad ditch filled with water. When the cunning-woman approached it she lifted up her skirts in order to walk across. Hans murmured softly, 'Hold fast, hold fast!' and the cunning-woman was forced to continue on her way while holding her skirts high. The news of the young couple's enchantment brought many neighbors to the scene, and everyone felt sorry for them. When the cunning-woman, weirdly holding up her skirts, approached the wedding house, a brash peasant touched her naked thigh with his tobacco pipe. Hans quickly said, 'Hold fast, hold fast!' and the peasant had to follow her. When the bride's father saw that Hans was laughing mockingly while everyone else was sadly standing by, he cried out, 'This evil was caused by no one other than Hans. It is his revenge. Come, let's beat the daylight out of him!' All hands immediately grabbed him and threw him over a bundle of straw, but when they raised their sticks Hans shouted, 'Hold fast, hold fast!' and not a one of them could move an arm. Recognizing the power of his magic charm, they begged Hans to free them. They promised him a rich land holding and many other valuables. Hans made them swear to this and then called out, 'Let go, let go!' Suddenly they were all free: the young couple, the pastor, the cunning woman, the brash peasant, and the angry neighbors. They all begged Hans never again to make use of the magic charm, which he promised. He received the property and the other valuables as agreed, and he died a wealthy and respected landowner.", "title": "Stupid Hans", "id": 432}

We have no money at all for you to take with you.'  Then the son said, 'I will take care of myself. I will always say, 'Not much, not much, not much.''  So he walked for a long time, always saying, 'Not much, not much, not much.'  Then he came to a group of fishermen, and said, 'God be with you. Not much, not much, not much.'  'What do you say, fellow? Not much?'  And when they pulled up their net, they had not caught many fish. So one of them fell on the boy with a stick, saying, 'Have you ever seen me thrash?'  'What should I say, then?' asked the boy.  'You should say, 'Catch a lot. Catch a lot.'  Then he again walked a long time, saying, 'Catch a lot. Catch a lot,' until he came to a gallows, where they were about to hang a poor sinner. Then said he, 'Good morning. Catch a lot. Catch a lot.'  'What do you say, fellow? Catch a lot? Should there be even more wicked people in the world? Isn't this enough?' And he again got it on his back.  'What should I say, then?' he asked.  'You should say, 'May God comfort the poor soul.'  Again the boy walked on for a long while, saying, 'May God comfort the poor soul.' Then he came to a ditch where a knacker was skinning a horse. The boy said, 'Good morning. May God comfort the poor soul.'  'What do you say, you disgusting fellow?' said the knacker, hitting him about the ears with his skinning hook until he could not see out of his eyes.  'What should I say, then?'  'You should say, 'Lie in the ditch, you carcass.''  So he walked on, saying, 'Lie in the ditch, you carcass. Lie in the ditch, you carcass.' He came to a coach filled with people, and said, 'Lie in the ditch, you carcass.'  Then the coach tipped over into the ditch, and the driver took his whip and beat the boy until he had to crawl back to his mother, and as long as he lived he never went traveling again.", "title": "Going Traveling", "id": 433}

{"label": "1540", "text": "In a remote village there lived a man and his wife, who was a stupid little woman and believed everything that was told her. Whenever people wanted anything from her they used to come and flatter her; but this had to be done in the absence of her husband, because he was a very miserly man, and would never part with any of his money, for all he was exceedingly rich. Nevertheless, without his knowledge cunning beggars would now and then come to his wife and beg of her, and they used generally to succeed, as she was so amenable to flattery. But whenever her husband found her out he would come down heavily upon her, sometimes with words and sometimes with blows. Thus quarrels arose, until at last, for the sake of peace, the wife had to give up her charitable propensities. Now there lived in the village a rogue of the first water, who had many a time witnessed what took place in the rich miser's family. Wishing to revive his old habit of getting what he wanted from the miser's wife he watched his opportunity and one day, when the miser had gone out on horseback to inspect his land, he came to his wife in the middle of the day and fell down at the threshold as if overcome by exhaustion. She ran up to him at once and asked him who he was. 'I am a native of Kail\u00c3\u00a2sa,' said he, 'sent down by an old couple living there, for news of their son and his wife.' 'Who are those fortunate dwellers on Shiva's mountain?' said she. On this the rogue gave the names of her husband's deceased parents, which he had taken good care, of course, to learn from the neighbors. 'Do you really come from them?' said she. 'Are they doing well there? Dear old people. How glad my husband would be to see you, were he here! Sit down please, and take rest awhile until he returns. How do they live there? Have they enough to eat and to dress themselves?' These and a thousand other questions she put to the rogue, who, for his part, wanted to get away as quick as possible, as he knew full well how he would be treated if the miser should return while he was there, so he said, 'Mother, language has no words to describe the miseries they are undergoing in the other world. They have not a rag to cover themselves, and for the last six days they have eaten nothing, and have lived on water only. It would break your heart to see them.' The rogue's pathetic words fully deceived the good woman, who firmly believed that he had come down from Kail\u00c3\u00a2sa, sent by the old couple to her. 'Why should they suffer so?' said she, 'when their son has plenty to eat and to dress himself, and when their daughter-in-law wears all sorts of costly ornaments?' With that she went into the house and came out with two boxes containing all the clothes of herself and her husband, and gave the whole lot to the rogue, with instructions to take them to her poor old people in Kail\u00c3\u00a2sa. She also gave him her jewel box for her mother-in-law. 'But dress and jewels will not fill their hungry stomachs,' said he. Requesting him to wait a little, the silly woman brought out her husband's cash chest and emptied the contents into the rogue's coat, who now went off in haste, promising to give everything to the good people in Kail\u00c3\u00a2sa. Our good lady in accordance with etiquette, conducted him a few hundred yards along the road and sent news of herself through him to her relatives, and then returned home. The rogue now tied up all his booty in his coat and ran in haste towards the river and crossed over it. No sooner had our heroine reached home than her husband returned after his inspection of his lands. Her pleasure at what she had done was so great, that she met him at the door and told him all about the arrival of the messenger from Kail\u00c3\u00a2sa, and how she had sent clothes, and jewels, and money through him to her husband's parents. The anger of her husband knew no bounds. But he checked himself for a while, and asked her which road the messenger from Kail\u00c3\u00a2sa had taken, as he said he wanted to follow him and send some more news to his parents. To this she willingly agreed and pointed out the direction the rogue had gone. With rage in his heart at the trick played upon his stupid wife, our hero rode on in hot haste, and after a ride of two ghatik\u00c3\u00a2s he caught sight of the departing rogue, who, finding escape hopeless, climbed up into a big p\u00c3\u00aepal tree. Our hero soon reached the bottom of the tree and shouted to the rogue to come down. 'No, I cannot, this is the way to Kail\u00c3\u00a2sa,' said the rogue, and climbed up on the top of the tree. Seeing no chance of the rogue's coming down, and as there was no third person present to whom he could call for help, our hero tied his horse to an adjacent tree and began climbing up the p\u00c3\u00aepal tree himself. The rogue thanked all his gods when he saw this, and waited until his enemy had climbed nearly up to him, and then, throwing down his bundle of booty, leapt quickly from branch to branch until he reached the bottom. He then got upon his enemy's horse, and with his bundle rode into a dense forest in which no one was likely to find him. Our hero being much older in years was no match for the rogue. So he slowly came down, and cursing his stupidity in having risked his horse to recover his property, returned home at his leisure. His wife, who was waiting his arrival, welcomed him with a cheerful countenance and said, 'I thought as much, you have sent away your horse to Kail\u00c3\u00a2sa to be used by your father.' Vexed as he was at his wife's words, our hero replied in the affirmative to conceal his own stupidity. Thus, some there are in this world, who, though they may not willingly give away anything, pretend to have done so when, by accident, or stupidity, they happen to lose it.", "title": "The Good Wife and the Bad Husband", "id": 435}
{"label": "155", "text": "A crocodile made his burrow in the embankment of a tank near a village. Afterwards the mud dried and became hard, so the crocodile was unable to get out of the hole. He was going to die. A man passed by on his was to fetch a midwife to attend to his wife. The crocodile heard him and said, 'Save me by breaking up the earth, so that I may get out.' The man broke up the earth and let him out. As there was no water left in the tank, the man placed the crocodile on his shoulder and went to the edge of the river. He then placed the crocodile into the water, but no sooner had he done so than the crocodile seized him by the arm and was about to eat him. 'Why are you going to eat me?' he asked. 'Do you not know how I helped you? And still you are going to eat me!' The crocodile said, 'It is true, indeed, that you helped me. But I am going to eat you, because I am hungry.' The man said, 'It is good. You may eat me, but first let as ask two or three persons as witnesses.' So they went to ask the witnesses about it. They came to a kumbuk tree, and the man said to it, 'This crocodile is going to eat me. I am asking your opinion of it.' 'What is it all about?' The man said, 'This crocodile was going to die. I saved him. Now he is going to eat me. Is that right?' The kumbuk tree said, 'O crocodile, do not let that man go. There is no animal so wicked as that man. He stays near a tree in its shade, then he breaks off its bark and leaves and takes them away. In the end he cuts it down and takes the whole tree.' From there he went and asked a cow, 'O cow, I saved this crocodile from death. He is now going to eat me. Do you think that is right?' The cow said, 'O crocodile, do not let that man go. That man is a wicked man. He takes our milk, and in the end he kills and eats us. Do not let him go.' After that he asked a jackal about it. The jackal asked, 'What is it all about?' He said to the jackal, 'O jackal, I saved this crocodile instead of letting him die. Now he is going to eat me.' The jackal said, 'I cannot give you a decision without knowing the whole story. You must show me the whole affair from the beginning.' So the man placed the crocodile on his shoulder and carried him back to his home. He put it back in its burrow and packed the soil in around him. The jackal said, 'Don't be afraid. I am on your side.' Then the man said, 'Jackal, hear this case.' The jackal said, 'I am both the judge and the witness. Now take up a cudgel and beat him until he is dead. I saw your excellence and his wickedness.' Retold by D. L. Ashliman.

{"label": "311", "text": "When the woodcutter went home at dusk, he boasted of the bargain to his wife, and next morning, took the girl to a certain cave and there gave her over to the stranger, who said that his name was Abu Freywar. As soon as the woodman was gone, Abu Freywar said to her, 'You must be hungry, eat these.' So saying, he took a knife and cut off both his ears, which he gave to her together with a nasty-looking loaf of black bread. The girl refusing such food, he hung her up by the hair from the ceiling of a chamber in the cave, which had meanwhile become a magnificent palace. Next day, Abu Freywar went again to the forest and found the woodcutter. 'I want your second daughter for my brother,' he said. 'Here is the money. Bring her to the cave tomorrow.' The woodcutter, delighted at his great good fortune, brought his second daughter to Abu Freywar, and directly he had gone, Abu Freywar gave the girl his ears, which had grown afresh, to eat. She said she was not hungry just then, but would keep them to eat by-and-by. When he went out of the room, she tried to deceive him by hiding his ears under a carpet on the floor. When he returned and asked if she had eaten them, she said 'Yes.' But he called out, 'Ears of mine, are you hot or cold? 'and they answered promptly, 'Cold as ice, and lying under the carpet.' Whereupon Abu Freywar, in a rage hung her up beside her sister. He then went and asked for the youngest daughter, whose name was Zerendac, saying, that he wanted her for another brother. But the girl, a spoilt child, refused to go unless she might take with her a pet kitten and a box in which she kept her treasures. Hugging those, she went with Abu Freywar to the cave. She proved wiser than her sisters. When her husband's back was turned, she gave his ears to the cat which devoured them eagerly, while she ate some food which she had brought from home. When the ogre returned and cried as of wont, 'Ears of mine, are you hot or cold?' He received the answer, 'As hot as can be in this snug little stomach,' and this pleased him so that from that time he began to grow very fond of Zerendac. After she had lived some days with him, he said, 'I must go on a journey. There are forty rooms in this palace. Here are the keys, with which you may open any door you please except that to which this golden key belongs,' and with that he took his departure. Zerendac amused herself in his absence with opening and examining the locked- up rooms. On entering the thirty-ninth, she happened to look out of the window which opened on to a burial ground, and was terrified to see her husband, who was a ghoul, devouring a corpse that he had just dug out of a grave with his long claw- like nails. She was so fascinated with the sight that (hidden behind the window curtain), she watched him at his horrible repast. A few minutes later she saw him start and hide himself behind a monument in the cemetery. He had been disturbed by the approach of a funeral. As the procession approached she heard one of the bearers say, 'Let us be off as soon as possible, lest the ghoul which haunts this place get hold of us,' and she could see that the whole company seemed very anxious. This discovery caused the girl great uneasiness. She was anxious to know what was in the fortieth room, and the discovery she had made as to the real character of her husband prompted her to solve the mystery at any cost. She took the golden key and opened the door. She found her two sisters still alive and dangling from the ceiling by their hair. She cut them down, fed them, and as soon as their health was restored, sent them back to her parents. Abu Freywar returned next day, but not for long. He left home a few days later, telling his wife she might invite any of her relations whom she cared to see. Accordingly she invited many of her friends and relatives, who came to see her, but heard nothing of her troubles. It was well for her that she did not complain, for her visitors were not the persons they seemed to be, but simply her husband in various shapes assumed in order to entrap her. He succeeded at last in the form of her grandmother to whom she was beginning to tell all her sorrows; when the old woman became Abu Freywar and, taking a poisoned nail, drove it into her breast. The wound did not kill her, but it caused her to swoon away. No sooner was she unconscious than the monster put her into a chest and sank it in the sea. Now the son of the sultan of that land was fond of boating and fishing, and this prince happened to cast a large net from a boat close to the place where the chest in which she was lay at the bottom of the sea. The net, happening to enclose the chest, was hauled in with the greatest difficulty. The sultan's son had it drawn into the boat, and, before opening it, said to his attendants, 'If it contains money or jewels, you may have them all; but should it contain anything else, it is mine.' He was greatly shocked when he saw its actual contents, and mourned the sad fate of that lovely girl. He had her body carried to his mother's chamber, to be honorably prepared for burial. During the process, the nail being found and removed, Zerendac sneezed and came to life again. She married the prince, and in course of time bore him a daughter. But one day, when she was alone with the child, the wall of her room suddenly split open, and Abu Freywar appeared. Without a word to the mother, he snatched up the infant and swallowed it, disappearing as suddenly as he had come. Zerendac was so bewildered by this fresh misfortune that, when asked where the baby had gone, she could only weep despairingly. Her second child, a son, and the third, another daughter, were torn from her in the same horrible manner. On this last occasion, the cruel ogre smeared the poor mother's face with her child's blood. She washed it off, but, in her hurry and anguish, missed a slight stain beneath her under lip. Her husband and her mother-in-law, already very suspicious, judged of course that she was a ghoul and had devoured her offspring. Zerendac told her story, but no one would believe it. Her husband, being loth to put her to death, ordered her to be imprisoned in a small underground chamber, and, at his mother's suggestion, sought another bride. Hearing of the beauty of the daughter of a neighboring sultan, he went to ask for her. But before setting out he sent for the mother of his lost children, and asked her what she would like him to bring her when he came back. She asked for a box of aloes [Arabic sebr, also meaning 'patience'], for a box of henna [the same word means 'tenderness'], and a dagger. Her request was granted, and when the prince returned from his betrothal to the sultan's daughter, he brought with him these things for Zerendac. She opened the boxes, one by one, saying, 'O box of sebr, you have not in you more patience than I have shown. O box of henna, you cannot be gentler than I have been,' and was just going to stab herself with the dagger, when the wall of her prison opened and Abu Frey war appeared, leading a handsome boy and two lovely girls. 'Live!' he cried, 'I have not killed your children. Here they are.' He then by his magic made a secret staircase connecting her dungeon with the great hall of the palace. Having done this, he seized the dagger and slew himself. When the festivities in connection with the prince's marriage began, Zerendac sent the three children, richly dressed in clothes which Abu Freywar had left with her, up the staircase, telling them to amuse themselves without respect for the guests or the furniture. Accordingly they did all the damage they could think of; but the mother of the prince was slow to punish them, because they were pretty, and reminded her of her son at their age. But at last, losing patience, she was going to strike one of them when they all shouted at once, 'Ya sitt Ubd\u00c3\u00bbr, shun keyf el kamr btad\u00c3\u00bbr,' which means, 'O Lady Full-Moon, look how the moon is turning round.' Everyone rushed to the window, and while their backs were turned the children vanished. On the actual wedding day the children appeared again when their father was present, ran about, breaking china and glass, and did all the damage they could think of. The prince forbade them. They replied haughtily, 'This is our house, and everything here belongs to us and to our parents.' 'What do you mean by that?' inquired the prince. The children answered by leading their father down the secret staircase to Zerendac, who explained who they really were and how they came there. The prince, greatly moved, embraced her tenderly and swore to be true to her till his life's end. The sultan's daughter was returned, with excuses and a satisfactory present, to her father; and the prince and Zerendac lived happy ever after.", "title": "Zerendac", "id": 437}
{"label": "545B", "text": "An impoverished father died, leaving his two sons only a bench and a cat. As he closed his eyes he said, 'Divide this small inheritance between the two of you. Let there be no dispute about it.' The older brother said, 'I'll take the bench, then at least I can sit down and rest as often as I like.' 'And I'll take the cat,' said the younger one, whose name Martin. 'She likes me, and is always following me everywhere.' They went their separate ways into the world. The older brother carried the bench with him, and whenever he got tired he sat down on it and rested. Martin, however, went on his way with the cat, and had every reason to be happy about his choice. Whenever he got hungry, the cat went into a house where a table had been set, then before the eyes of the astonished people she carried food away to her master. Thus he never lacked food and drink. The cat also took care of his dress by stealing a beautiful piece of clothing here and there, and bringing it to him. Thus he was dressed like a real gentleman. Therefore the cat said to him, 'When the people ask about your name, tell them that you are called Count Martin of the Cat. He liked this idea. 'I would never have dreamed,' he said, laughing to himself, 'that with the help of my dear cat I should become a count.' One day they came to a wide plain. There were beautiful green meadows and fields, and they asked the people to whom they belonged. 'To such and such a count,' they replied. They went onward, coming to magnificent forests and still more beautiful meadows with numerous flocks and shepherds. As often as they asked, everything belonged to that count. Finally they came to the palace where the rich old count himself lived with his wife. They were received there graciously. When the old gentlemen went to the cellar to get wine, the cat took the opportunity to creep after him, then strangled him in the cellar. The count's wife then went to the cellar to see what was keeping her husband so long. The cat jumped on her, and strangled her too. Then the cat went upstairs to her master and said, 'The two old ones down in the cellar are dead. Now you are the master of the palace. You must behave as such. Leave all the rest to me.' Then she ran out to the fields and meadows and forests, and everywhere she saw mowers, woodsmen, or shepherds, she cried, 'The old count and his wife are dead, and have named my lord, Count Martin of the Cat, as their heir. He is now your rightful master. He has charged me with making this known to you, so that you may know his name and obey him alone.' Everywhere the people replied, 'We are your servants, Madame Cat. If our old master has died, then he died well. Long live our new master!' Count Martin of the Cat had now the most wonderful life in the world. One day his brother came to the castle, still carrying the bench with him, and still desperately poor. He did not recognize Martin, but the latter took him in and gave him a position as overseer in his court. He too now had a good life and could sit on his bench whenever he wanted to. Some time later the cat said to her master, 'I feel that I'm getting old, and that my end is near. I have helped you to your good fortune, so show your thanks by having me buried with dignity and with a beautiful gravestone. I deserve this much.' Then she secretly decided to put her master to the test. One day she lay down on the floor, pretending to be dead. When Martin saw her, he said, 'So the disgusting animal is finally dead!' And he was about to throw he body out into the courtyard. Jumping to her feet, the cat cried out, 'You unthankful one, is this how you are going to treat the one to whom you owe everything?' She continued with a stream of rebukes, all of which he silently accepted, for he knew that he deserved the condemnation. Finally he answered her, saying that he was sorry and asking for her forgiveness. 'After you death of course I will have you buried with dignity and give you a beautiful gravestone,' he solemnly promised. More time passed, and the cat did indeed die. Count Martin kept his promise and had her solemnly buried. I almost do not want to say so, but I was told that he had her buried in a church. He is said to have placed a beautiful gravestone in her honor, upon which her achievements were engraved in glowing words. Today the stone is no longer to be found, nor can anyone remember having seen it. Furthermore, no one knows what has become of it.", "title": "Count Martin of the Cat", "id": 438}
{"label": "502", "text": "Somewhere or other, but I don't know where, there lived a king who owned two remarkably fine fields of rape, but every night two of the rape heaps were burnt down in one of the fields. The king was extremely angry at this, and sent out soldiers to catch whoever had set fire to the ricks; but it was all of no use -- not a soul could they see. Then he offered nine hundred crowns to anyone who caught the evildoer, and at the same time ordered that whoever did not keep proper watch over the fields should be killed; but though there were a great many people, none seemed able to protect the fields. The king had already put ninety-nine people to death, when a little swineherd came to him who had two dogs; one was called 'Psst,' and the other 'Hush'; and the boy told the king that he would watch over the ricks. When it grew dark he climbed up on the top of the fourth rick, from where he could see the whole field. About eleven o'clock he thought he saw someone going to a rack and putting a light to it. 'Just you wait,' thought he, and called out to his dogs: 'Hi! Psst, Hush, catch him!' But Psst and Hush had not waited for orders, and in five minutes the man was caught. Next morning he was brought bound before the king, who was so pleased with the boy that he gave him a thousand crowns at once. The prisoner was all covered with hair, almost like an animal; and altogether he was so curious to look at that the king locked him up in a strong room and sent out letters of invitation to all the other kings and princes asking them to come and see this wonder. That was all very well; but the king had a little boy of ten years old who went to look at the hairy man also, and the man begged so hard to be set free that the boy took pity on him. He stole the key of the strong room from his mother and opened the door. Then he took the key back, but the hairy man escaped and went off into the world. Then the kings and princes began to arrive one after another, and all were most anxious to see the hairy man; but he was gone! The king nearly burst with rage and with the shame he felt. He questioned his wife sharply, and told her that if she could not find and bring back the hairy man he would put her in a hut made of rushes and burn her there. The queen declared she had had nothing to do with the matter; if her son had happened to take the key it had not been with her knowledge. So they fetched the little prince and asked him all sorts of questions, and at last he owned that he had let the hairy man out. The king ordered his servants to take the boy into the forest and to kill him there, and to bring back part of his liver and lungs. There was grief all over the palace when the king's command was known, for he was a great favourite. But there was no help for it, and they took the boy out into the forest. But the man was sorry for him, and shot a dog and carried pieces of his lungs and liver to the king, who was satisfied, and did not trouble himself any more. The prince wandered about in the forest and lived as best he could for five years. One day he came upon a poor little cottage in which was an old man. They began to talk, and the prince told his story and sad fate. Then they recognised each other, for the old fellow was no other than the hairy man whom the prince had set free, and who had lived ever since, in the forest. The prince stayed here for two years; then he wished to go further. The old man begged him hard to stay, but he would not, so his hairy friend gave him a golden apple out of which came a horse with a golden mane, and a golden staff with which to guide the horse. The old man also gave him a silver apple out of which came the most beautiful hussars and a silver staff; and a copper apple from which he could draw as many foot soldiers as ever he wished, and a copper staff. He made the prince swear solemnly to take the greatest care of these presents, and then he let him go. The boy wandered on and on till he came to a large town. Here he took service in the king's palace, and as no one troubled themselves about him he lived quietly on. One day news was brought to the king that he must go out to war. He was horribly frightened for he had a very small army, but he had to go all the same. When they had all left, the prince said to the housekeeper: 'Give me leave to go to the next village -- I owe a small bill there, and I want to go and pay it'; and as there was nothing to be done in the palace the housekeeper gave him leave. When he got beyond the town he took out his golden apple, and when the horse sprang out he swung himself into the saddle. Then he took the silver and the copper apples, and with all these fine soldiers he joined the king's army. The king saw them approach with fear in his heart, for he did not know if it might not be an enemy; but the prince rode up, and bowed low before him. 'I bring your majesty reinforcements,' said he. The king was delighted, and all dread of his enemy at once disappeared. The princesses were there too, and they were very friendly with the prince and begged him to get into their carriage so as to talk to them. But he declined, and remained on horseback, as he did not know at what moment the battle might begin; and whilst they were all talking together the youngest princess, who was also the loveliest, took off her ring, and her sister tore her handkerchief in two pieces, and they gave these gifts to the prince. Suddenly the enemy came in sight. The king asked whether his army or the prince's should lead the way; but the prince set off first and with his hussars he fought so bravely that only two of the enemy were left alive, and these two were only spared to act as messengers. The king was overjoyed and so were his daughters at this brilliant victory. As they drove home they begged the prince to join them, but he would not come, and galloped off with his hussars. When he got near the town he packed his soldiers and his fine horse all carefully into the apple again, and then strolled into the town. On his return to the palace he was well scolded by the housekeeper for staying away so long. Well, the whole matter might have ended there; but it so happened that the younger princess had fallen in love with the prince, as he had with her. And as he had no jewels with him, he gave her the copper apple and staff. One day, as the princesses were talking with their father, the younger one asked him whether it might not have been their servant who had helped him so much. The king was quite angry at the idea; but, to satisfy her, he ordered the servant's room to be searched. And there, to everyone's surprise, they found the golden ring and the half of the handkerchief. When these were brought to the king he sent for the prince at once and asked if it had been he who had come to their rescue. 'Yes, your majesty, it was I,' answered the prince. 'But where did you get your army?' 'If you wish to see it, I can show it you outside the city walls.' And so he did; but first he asked for the copper apple from the younger princess, and when all the soldiers were drawn up there were such numbers that there was barely room for them. The king gave him his daughter and kingdom as a reward for his aid, and when he heard that the prince was himself a king's son his joy knew no bounds. The prince packed all his soldiers carefully up once more, and they went back into the town. Not long after there was a grand wedding; perhaps they may all be alive still, but I don't know.", "title": "The Hairy Man", "id": 439}
{"label": "2", "text": "Very long ago there were two men living together, and making maple sugar. They made one mokok ('bark box') of sugar, and then they cached it away, burying it, and said to each other, 'We will let it remain here until we are very hungry.'  The younger man was a Fox, and he was a good hunter. Every time he went out, he brought home chickens or small wild game. The other man was a greedy Wolf, and he never killed anything, or brought anything home: so Fox thought he would play a trick on his chum for being lazy.  'You ought to go over to that house,' said Fox to Wolf. 'Maybe they will give you something to eat. When I went over there, they gave me a chicken.'  So Wolf went over as he was told. When he got to the house, he did not hide himself, but went in open sight. The owner of the house saw the Wolf coming up, so he set his dogs on him to drive him away; and Wolf escaped only by running into the river.  'So it is this one that takes off our chickens!' said the man.  When Wolf arrived at his home, he told his younger brother, Fox, 'Why, I hardly escaped from that man!'  'Why!' said Fox to him. 'They did not recognize you; that's why.' But Wolf made no answer.  While they were in the house together, Fox went outside, and cried, 'He!' to deceive Wolf.  'What's the matter with you?' asked Wolf.  'Oh! they have come after me to give a name to a child.'  'Then you'd better go over. Maybe they will give you something to eat.'  Instead of going, however, Fox went to their cache of maple sugar, and ate some of it. When he returned, Wolf asked him, 'What did you name the baby?'  'Mokimon,' replied Fox; and this word means to 'reveal' or 'dig out' something you have hidden.  At another time, while they were sitting together, Fox said, 'He!' and 'Oh, yes!'  'What's that?' inquired Wolf.  'Oh! I am called to give a name to a newborn baby.'  'Well, then, go. Maybe they will give you something to eat.'  So Fox went and returned. 'What's the name of the child?' asked Wolf.  This time, Fox answered, 'Wapiton'; and this word means 'to commence to eat.'  At another time, Fox cried out, 'He!' and 'All right!' as though some one had called to him, 'I'll come.'  'What's that?' asked Wolf.  'They want me to go over and name their child.'  'Well, then, go,' says Wolf. 'You always get something to eat every time they want you.'  So Fox went, and soon returned. Wolf asked him again, 'What name did you give it?'  'Hapata kiton,' answered Fox; that is to say, 'half eaten.'  Then another time Fox cried 'He!' as if in answer to some one speaking to him, and then, as though some one called from the distance, 'Hau!'  Wolf, as he did not quite hear, asked Fox what the matter was. 'Oh, nothing!' replied Fox, 'only they want me to come over and name their child.'  'Well, then, you'd better go. Maybe you'll get a chance to eat; maybe you'll fetch me something too.'  So Fox started out, and soon returned home.  'Well, what name did you give this time?' asked Wolf.  'Noskwaton,' said Fox; and this means 'all licked up.'  Then Wolf caught on. 'Maybe you are eating our stored maple sugar!' he cried. But Fox sat still and laughed at him.  Then Wolf went over and looked at their cache. Sure enough, he found the empty box with its contents all gone, and pretty well licked up.  Meantime Fox skipped out, and soon found a large tree by the river, leaning out over the water. He climbed into its branches and hid there. Presently the angry Wolf returned home, and, not finding Fox, tracked him to the tree. Wolf climbed part way to Fox without seeing him, as he was on the branches. Then Wolf was afraid, and while he was hesitating, he happened to look at the water, and there he saw the reflection of Fox laughing at him on the surface. The Wolf, in a fury, plunged into the bottom of the stream, but of course failed to catch Fox. He tried four times, and after the fourth attempt he was tired, and quit jumping in for a while. While he was resting, he looked up and saw Fox laughing at him.  Then Wolf said to Fox, 'Let's go home and make up'; for he thought in his heart that anyway Fox was feeding him all the time.  By and by it became winter. Fox frequently went out, and returned with abundance of fish. 'How do you manage to get so many?' asked Wolf.  'You'd better go out and try for yourself,' said Fox. 'The way I do, when I am fishing, is to cut a hole in the ice. I put my tail in, instead of a line, and I remain there until I feel bites. I move ahead a little to let the fish string on my tail; but I stay a long time, until I get a great many fish on my tail. When it feels pretty heavy, I jerk it out, and catch all I want.'  Fox was in hopes that he could get Wolf frozen to death in the ice, and so avoid the necessity of feeding him any longer. So he took Wolf out, and cut five holes in the ice, -- one for his tail, and one for each paw, -- telling him he could catch more fish that way. Wolf staid there to fish all night. Every once in a while he would move his feet or tail a little, and they felt so heavy, he was sure he was getting a tremendous load; and he staid a little longer. In the mean time he was freezing fast in the ice. When he found out the predicament he was in, he jerked backwards and forwards again and again, until all the hair wore off his tail, and there he was. He thought he had let too many fish on his tail and feet to haul them out, and he worked hard to free himself. At last he wore his tail out at the surface of the ice, and pulled off his claws and the bottoms of his feet. Fox told him he had caught too many fish, and that they had bitten his tail and feet; and Wolf believed it.  Another time, Fox found a wasp's nest in a tree: so he went home and told Wolf that there was honey in it, and persuaded him to try and jump up and get it, on the plea that Wolf could jump higher than he could. As soon as Wolf set out to try, Fox ran away, and Wolf was nearly stung to death. Fox fled over a wagon-road to conceal his tracks, and as he travelled, he met a negro with a team, hauling a load of bread. Fox, cunning as he was, lay down on the side of the road and pretended that he was dead. The negro saw him lying there, and picked him up and put him in his wagon behind his load. Fox very presently came to, and, waiting for his chance, he would throw off a loaf of bread every now and then, till he had gotten rid of a good many. Then he jumped off, and carried the loaves to a secret place, where he built him a shelter, and prepared to live for a time.  In the meantime, Wolf came along, half starved, and crippled from his meddling with a live wasp's nest and from his fishing experience. Fox fed him on his arrival, and said, 'You ought to do the way I did. It's easy to get bread. I got mine by playing dead on the road. Tomorrow the negro will pass by with another load; and you can watch for him and do as I did, and steal his bread.'  Next morning, Wolf started out to watch the road, and pretty soon he saw the negro coming with a big load of bread: so he lay down beside the road, where the darky could see him, and played dead. The darky did see him, sure enough; and he stopped his team, and got off and got a big stick, and knocked Wolf over the head, and killed him dead for sure.  'I will not get fooled this time!' he said, 'for yesterday I lost too many loaves of bread for putting a dead Fox in my wagon without examining him.'  So he did take the Wolf home dead. That ended him, and since then Fox has eaten alone.", "title": "Fox and Wolf", "id": 440}
{"label": "480", "text": "There was once a stepmother who, besides her stepdaughter, had a daughter of her own. Whatever her own daughter might do, she looked kindly at her and said, 'Sensible darling!' but as for the step daughter, whatever she might do to please, it was always taken amiss. Everything she did was wrong, and not as it should be. Yet, sooth to say, the little stepdaughter was as good as gold; in good hands she would have swum in cheese and butter, but, living with her stepmother, she bathed herself every day in tears. What was she to do? The blast, though it blows, does not blow forever, but a scolding old woman it is not so easy to avoid. She will take anything into her head, even to combing one's teeth. And the stepmother took it into her head to drive her stepdaughter from the house. 'Take her, take her away, my old man, whithersoever you like, that mine eyes may not see her, that my ears may not hear of her; but don't take her to my own daughter in the warm room, but take her into the bare fields to the bitter, biting frost.' The old man began to lament and weep, but for all that he put his daughter in the sledge; he would have liked to cover her with the horse-cloth, but even that he dared not do. So he took the homeless one into the bare fields, threw her on a heap of snow, crossed himself, and hastened home as fast as possible, that his eyes might not see his daughter's death. There the poor little thing remained on the fringe of the forest, sat down under a fir-tree, shivered, and softly said her prayers. All at once she heard some thing. Morozko was crackling in a fir-tree not far off, and he leaped from fir to fir and snapped his fingers. And look! now he has come to that fir beneath which the girl was sitting; and he snapped his fingers, and leaped up and down, and looked at the pretty girl. 'Maiden, maiden, 'tis I -- Moroz-Ruby-Nose!' 'Welcome, Moroz! God must have sent thee to my poor sinful soul.' 'Art thou warm, Maiden?' 'Warm, warm, dear little father Morozushko!' Moroz began to descend lower, and crackle still more, and snap his fingers more than ever, and again he began speaking to the girl. 'Art thou warm, maiden? Art thou warm, beauty?' The girl was scarce able to draw her breath, and yet she kept on saying, 'Yes, warm, Morozushko; warm, little father!' Morozko crackled more than ever, and snapped his fingers harder and yet harder, and he said to the maiden for the last time, 'Art thou warm, maiden? Art thou warm, beauty? Art thou warm, sweet clover?' The girl was all benumbed, and it was only in a voice scarcely audible that she could say, 'Oh, yes! warm, darling little pigeon mine, Morozushko!' Morozko quite loved her for her pretty speeches. He had compassion on the girl; he wrapped her in furs, warmed her with warm coverings, and brought her a coffer, high and heavy, full of bridal garments, and gave her a robe all garnished with gold and silver. She put it on, and oh, how beautiful and stately she looked! And she sat down and began to sing songs. And the stepmother was preparing her funeral feast and frying pancakes. 'Be off, husband, and bury your daughter!' she cried. And off the old man went. But the little dog under the table said, 'Bow-wow! The old man's daughter is going about in silver and gold, but the old woman's daughter no wooers will look at.' 'Silence, you fool! There's a pancake for you, and now say, 'The wooers will take the old woman's daughter, but there's nothing left of the old man's daughter but her bones.'' The little dog ate the pancake, but again he said, 'Bow-wow! The old man's daughter goes about in silver and gold, but the old woman's daughter no wooers will look at.' The old woman kept beating the dog and giving him pancakes, but the little dog would have his way, and said, 'The old man's daughter goes about in silver and gold, but the old woman's daughter no wooers will look at.' The floors creaked, the doors flew open wide, and in they brought the high and heavy coffer, and behind it walked the stepdaughter, in gold and silver, glittering like the sun. The stepmother looked at her, and threw up her arms. 'Old man, old man! Put to a pair of horses, and take my daughter at once. Put her in the selfsame field, in the selfsame place.' And the old man took the daughter to the selfsame place. And Moroz-Ruby-Nose came and looked at his guest, and began to ask her, 'Art thou warm, maiden?' 'Be off with you!' replied the old woman's daughter, 'or are you blind not to see that my arms and legs are quite benumbed with cold?' Morozko began skipping and jumping, fair words were not to be expected from that quarter. And he was angry with the step daughter, and froze her to death. 'Old man, old man! Go and fetch my daughter. Put to my swift horses, and don't overturn the sledge and upset the coffer.' But the little dog under the table said, 'Bow-wow! The wooers will wed the old man's daughter, but they'll bring home nothing of the old woman's daughter but a sack of bones.' 'Don't lie! There's a cake. Take it and say, 'They'll carry about the old woman's daughter in gold and silver!'' And the doors flew open, the nasty old woman ran out to meet her daughter, and instead of her she embraced a cold corpse. She began to howl and cry. She knew then that she had lost her wicked and envious daughter.", "title": "Morozko (Jack Frost)", "id": 441}

{"label": "306", "text": "There lived once together a king and a queen, and a princess who was their daughter. The princess had worn out every evening seven pairs of slippers made of iron; and the king could not make out how that could be, though he was always trying to find out. The king at last issued a decree, that whosoever should be able to find out how the princess managed to wear out seven slippers made of iron in the short space of time between morning and evening, he would give the princess in marriage if he were a man, and if a woman he would marry her to a prince. It happened that a soldier was walking along an open country road carrying on his back a sack of oranges, and he saw two men fighting and giving each other great blows. The soldier went up to them and asked them, 'Oh, men, why are you giving each other such blows?' 'Why indeed should it be!' they replied. 'Because our father is dead, and he has left us this cap, and we both wish to possess it.' 'Is it possible that for the sake of a cap you should be fighting?' inquired the soldier. The men then said, 'The reason is that this cap has a charm, and if any one puts it on and says, 'Cap, cover me so that no one shall see me!' no one can see us.' The soldier upon hearing this said to them, 'I'll tell you what I can do for you; you let me remain here with the cap whilst I throw this orange to a great distance, and you run after it, and the one that shall pick it up first shall be the possessor of the cap.' The men agreed to this, and the soldier threw the orange to a great distance, as far as he possibly could, whilst the men both ran to pick it up. Here the soldier without loss of time put on the cap saying, 'Cap, make me invisible.' When the men returned with the orange they could see nothing and nobody. The soldier went away with the cap, and further on he met on his road two other men fighting, and he said to them, 'Oh, foolish men, why do you give The men replied, 'Indeed, you may well ask why, if it were not that father died and left us this pair of boots, and we, each of us, wish to be the sole possessor of them.' The soldier replied, 'Is it possible that for the matter of a pair of boots you should be fighting thus?' And they replying said, 'It is because these boots are charmed, and when one wishes to go any distance he has only to say, 'Boots take me here or there,' wherever one should wish to go, and instantly they convey one to any place.' The soldier said to them, 'I will tell you what to do; I will throw an orange to a great distance, and you give me the boots to keep; you run for the orange, and the first who shall pick it up shall have the pair of boots.' He threw the orange to a great distance and both men ran to catch it. Upon this the soldier said, 'Cap, make me invisible, boots take me to the city!' and when the men returned they missed the boots, and the soldier, for he had gone away. He arrived at the capital and heard the decree read which the king had promulgated, and he began to consider what he had better do in this case. 'With this cap, and with these boots I can surely find out what the princess does to wear out seven pairs of slippers made of iron in one night.' He went and presented himself at the palace. When the king saw him he said, 'Do you really know a way of finding out how the princess, my daughter, can wear out seven slippers in one night?' The soldier replied, 'I only ask you to let me try.' 'But you must remember,' said the king, 'that if at the end of three days you have not found out the mystery, I shall order you to be put to death.' The soldier to this replied that he was prepared to take the consequences. The king ordered him to remain in the palace. Every attention was paid to all his wants and wishes, he had his meals with the king at the same table, and slept in the princess's room. But what did the princess do? She took him a beverage to his bedside and gave it to him to drink. This beverage was a sleeping draught which she gave him to make him sleep all night. Next morning the soldier had not seen the princess do anything, for he had slept very soundly the whole night. When he appeared at breakfast the king asked him, 'Well, did you see anything?' 'Your majesty must know that I have seen nothing whatever.' The king said, 'Look well what you are at, for now there only remains two days more for you, or else you die!' The soldier replied, 'I have not the least misgivings.' Night came on and the princess acted as before. Next morning the king asked him again at breakfast, 'Well, have you seen anything last night?' The soldier replied, 'Your majesty must know that I have seen nothing whatever.' 'Be careful, then, what you do, only one day more and you die!' The soldier replied, 'I have no misgivings.' He then began to think it over. 'It is very curious that I should sleep all night -- it cannot be from anything else but from drinking the beverage which the princess gives me. Leave me alone, I know what I shall do; when the princess brings me the cup I shall pretend to drink, but shall throw away the beverage.' The night came and the princess did not fail to bring him the beverage to drink to his bedside. The soldier made a pretence to drink it, but instead threw it away, and feigned sleep though he was awake. In the middle of the night he saw the princess rise up, prepare to go out, and advance towards the door to leave. What did he do then? He put on the cap, drew on the boots, and said, 'Cap make me invisible, boots take me wherever the princess goes.' The princess entered a carriage, and the soldier followed her into the carriage and accompanied her. He saw the carriage stop at the seashore. The princess then embarked on board a vessel decked with flags. The soldier on seeing this said, 'Cap, cover me, that I may be invisible,' and embarked with the princess. She reached the land of giants, and when on passing the first sentinel, he challenged her with 'Who's there?' 'The Princess of Harmony,' she replied. The sentinel rejoined, 'Pass with your suite.' The princess looked behind her, and not seeing any one following her she said to herself, 'The sentinel cannot be in his sound mind; he said 'pass with your suite.' I do not see any one.' She reached the second sentinel, who cried out at the top of his voice, 'Who's there?' 'The Princess of Harmony,' replied the princess. 'Pass with your suite,' said the sentinel. The princess was each time more and more astonished. She came to the third sentinel, who challenged her as the others had done, 'The Princess of Harmony.' 'Pass on with your suite,' rejoined the sentinel. The princess as before wondered what the man could mean. After journeying for a long time the soldier who followed her closely saw the princess arrive at a beautiful palace, enter in, and go into a hall for dancing, where he saw many giants. The princess sat upon a seat by the side of her lover who was a giant. The soldier hid himself under their seat. The band struck up, and she rose to dance with the giant, and when she finished the dance she had her iron slippers all in pieces. She took them off and pushed them under her seat. The soldier immediately took possession of them and put them inside his sack. The princess again sat down to converse with her lover. The band again struck up some dance music and the princess rose to dance. When she finished this dance another of her slippers had worn out. She took them off and left them under her seat. The soldier put these also into his sack. Finally, she danced seven times, and each time she danced she tore a pair of slippers made of iron. The soldier kept them all in his sack. After the ball the princess sat down to converse with her lover; and what did the soldier do? He turned their chairs over and threw them both on the middle of the floor. They were very much surprised and they searched everywhere and through all the houses and could find no one. The giants then looked out for a book of fates they had, wherein could be seen the course of the winds and other auguries peculiar to their race. They called in a black servant to read in the book and find out what was the matter. The soldier rose up from where he was and said, 'Cap, make me invisible.' He then gave the negro a slap on the face, the negro fell to the ground, while he took possession of the book and kept it. The time was approaching when the princess must depart and return home, and not being able to stay longer she went away. The soldier followed her and she returned by the same way she came. She went on board and when she reached the city the carriage was already waiting for her. The soldier then said, 'Boots take me to the palace,' and he arrived there, took off his clothes, and went to bed. When the princess arrived she found everything in her chamber just as she left it, and even found the soldier fast asleep. In the morning the king said, 'Well, soldier, did you see anything remarkable last night?' 'Be it known to your majesty that I saw nothing whatever last night,' replied the soldier. The king then said, 'According to what you say, I do not know if you are aware that you must die today.' The soldier replied, 'If it is so I must have patience, what else can I do?' When the princess heard this she rejoiced much. The king then ordered that everything for the execution should be prepared before the palace windows. When the soldier was proceeding to execution he asked the king to grant him a favor for the last time and to send for the princess so that she should be present. The king gave the desired permission, and the princess was present, when he said to her, 'Is it true to say that the princess went out at midnight?' 'It is not true,' replied the princess. 'Is it true to say,' again asked the soldier, 'that the princess entered a carriage, and afterwards went on board a vessel and proceeded to a ball given in the kingdom of the giants?' The princess replied, 'It is not true.' The soldier yet asked her another question, 'Is it true that the princess tore seven pair of slippers during the seven times she danced?' and then he showed her the slippers. 'There is no truth in all this,' replied the princess. The soldier at last said to her, 'Is it true to say that the princess at the end of the ball fell on the floor from her seat, and the giants had a book brought to them to see what bewitchery and magic pervaded and had taken possession of the house, and which book is here?' The princess now said, 'It is so.' The king was delighted at the discovery and happy ending of this affair, and the soldier came to live in the palace and married the princess.

{"label": "1319", "text": "A truly rural story, which indicated to me no small sense of that humour which I am claiming as a set-off against our country dulness, I had from a stranger, an elderly farmer, as I took him to be, a fellow passenger in a train from Salisbury to Grately. Should my unknown friend ever see my version of his tale, I hope that he will pardon me for spoiling it by my indifferent telling, and that he will accept my thanks for the enjoyment which it afforded me. It ran thus, as nearly as I remember: Two cockneys, who had come down to stay a few days in the country, near Grately, on the borders of Hampshire and Wiltshire, met in their walk one morning an old man, who, my informant said, was 'a droll old chap,' and who happened to have a large pumpkin under his arm. The Londoners noticed that the old man was carrying something, though they could not quite make out what it was, and confident in their power as town-dwellers, they thought they would have a little joke at the old countryman's expense. So they opened fire. 'Good morning, master.' 'Good marnin', zur.' 'What is that you are carrying under your arm, friend?' ''Tis a mare's egg, zur.' 'Dear me,' said the Londoners, not liking to own their ignorance, 'it's the finest we ever saw.' 'Ah, zur,' said the old man, there's lots of common 'uns about, but this is a thoroughbred 'un, zur; that's what makes 'un look so vine.' 'Will you sell it?' said the cockneys. 'Well,' said the old man, 'I doan't mind partin' wi' 'un, tho' I doan't s'pose you'll give the money I want for a thoroughbred mare's egg.' After some bargaining, the men put their hands into their pockets and paid what was asked. The old man then handed over the pumpkin, and as he did so, looked at them very seriously, and said, 'Now, mind, zur, and do 'ee take great care wi' 'un, for she'll hatch soon!' Away went the Londoners with their mare's egg, and as they were crossing a hill just by Grately station, which my informant pointed out, the one who was carrying the prize stumbled over one of the juniper bushes with which the hill is dotted about, and dropped the pumpkin, starting at the same time a hare out of the bush. In their excitement, and thinking, I suppose, that the fall had suddenly hastened the hatching, they shouted wildly to some men at work in a field at the bottom of the hill 'Hi! Stop our colt! Stop our colt!' The story, told as it was in the purest Wiltshire dialect, was truly amusing. It is, however, a curious illustration of the temptation to give an air of reality and a proportionately increased interest to an anecdote by assigning it to a particular person or locality. When I heard the story in the train, and saw my friend point out the very scene of it on the hill at Grately, I felt that I was receiving it fresh from the very fountain-head. To my surprise, however, I found only the other day that the narrative in almost identical words was a favourite one of the father of one of my own parishioners, a Kentish man born and bred, who had been a resident all his life in his own county. I have since also been assured by a friend in the next parish, that her late husband's father, a Scotchman, living twenty miles beyond the border, used to tell this very same story with the greatest satisfaction. Where, therefore, it took its rise, and how it became known in districts so wide apart as Wiltshire, Kent, and the Lowlands of Scotland, are questions which I, at any rate, am not able to answer.", "title": "The Two Cockneys and the Mare's Egg", "id": 444}

And when you get there, you must say, 'A hundred every day! A hundred every day!''  Michel said, 'I will do that.'  Upon his arrival in the village a funeral coach came his way, and he cried out, 'A hundred every day! A hundred every day!'  Then the pallbearers came and gave him a beating. Michel returned home and said to his mother, 'Mother, I got beaten up.'  His mother asked, 'Why?'  Michel replied, 'When I arrived in the village a funeral coach came my way, and I cried out, 'A hundred every day! A hundred every day! Then the pallbearers came and gave me a beating.'  'You did a bad thing,' responded his mother. 'You should have cried and wrung your hands.'  'I can still do that,' replied Michel.  When he arrived in the village again, a wedding coach came his way, so Michel sat down and cried and wrung his hands. Then the members of the wedding party came and gave him a beating.  Michel returned home again and said to his mother, 'I got beaten up again!'  'Why this time?' asked his mother.  'Well,' said Michel, 'when I arrived in the village a wedding coach came my way, so I sat down and cried and wrung my hands. Then the members of the wedding party came and gave me a beating.'  'You did a bad thing,' responded the mother. 'You should have danced and shouted, 'Happiness and joy! Happiness and joy!''  'I can still do that,' replied Michel.  When he arrived in the village this time, there was a house on fire. He ran up to it, dancing and shouting, 'Happiness and joy! Happiness and joy!' Then the men came and gave him a beating.  Michel returned home again and said to his mother, 'I got beaten up again!'  'Why this time?' asked his mother.  Michel said, 'When I arrived in the village, there was a house on fire.

'You should have thrown a bucket of water on it.'  'I can still do that,' replied Michel.  When he arrived in the village this time, there was a wagon standing there filled with beehives, so he took a bucket of water and poured in on the bees.

Michel answered, 'When I arrived in the village, there was a wagon standing there filled with beehives, so I took a bucket of water and poured in on the bees.

{"label": "954", "text": "Once upon a time there were two brothers whose father had left them but a small fortune. The eldest grew very rich, but at the same time cruel and wicked, whereas there was nowhere a more honest or kinder man than the younger. But he remained poor, and had many children, so that at times they could scarcely get bread to eat. At last, one day there was not even this in the house, so he went to his rich brother and asked him for a loaf of bread. Waste of time! His rich brother only called him beggar and vagabond, and slammed the door in his face. The poor fellow, after this brutal reception, did not know which way to turn. Hungry, scantily clad, shivering with cold, his legs could scarcely carry him along. He had not the heart to go home, with nothing for the children, so he went towards the mountain forest. But all he found there were some wild pears that had fallen to the ground. He had to content himself with eating these, though they set his teeth on edge. But what was he to do to warm himself, for the east wind with its chill blast pierced him through and through. 'Where shall I go?' he said; 'what will become of us in the cottage? There is neither food nor fire, and my brother has driven me from his door.' It was just then he remembered having heard that the top of the mountain in front of him was made of crystal, and had a fire for ever burning upon it. 'I will try and find it,' he said, 'and then I may be able to warm myself a little.' So he went on climbing higher and higher till he reached the top, when he was startled to see twelve strange beings sitting round a huge fire. He stopped for a moment, but then said to himself, 'What have I to lose? Why should I fear? God is with me. Courage!' So he advanced towards the fire, and bowing respectfully, said: 'Good people, take pity on my distress. I am very poor, no one cares for me, I have not even a fire in my cottage; will you let me warm myself at yours?' They all looked kindly at him, and one of them said: 'My son, come sit down with us and warm yourself.' So he sat down, and felt warm directly he was near them. But he dared not speak while they were silent. What astonished him most was that they changed seats one after another, and in such a way that each one passed round the fire and came back to his own place. When he drew near the fire an old man with long white beard and bald head arose from the flames and spoke to him thus: 'Man, waste not thy life here; return to thy cottage, work, and live honestly. Take as many embers as thou wilt, we have more than we need.' And having said this he disappeared. Then the twelve filled a large sack with embers, and, putting it on the poor man's shoulders, advised him to hasten home. Humbly thanking them, he set off. As he went he wondered why the embers did not feel hot, and why they should weigh no more than a sack of paper. He was thankful that he should be able to have a fire, but imagine his astonishment when on arriving home he found the sack to contain as many gold pieces as there had been embers; he almost went out of his mind with joy at the possession of so much money. With all his heart he thanked those who had been so ready to help him in his need. He was now rich, and rejoiced to be able to provide for his family. Being curious to find out how many gold pieces there were, and not knowing how to count, he sent his wife to his rich brother for the loan of a quart measure. This time the brother was in a better temper, so he lent what was asked of him, but said mockingly, 'What can such beggars as you have to measure?' The wife replied, 'Our neighbour owes us some wheat; we want to be sure he returns us the right quantity.' The rich brother was puzzled, and suspecting something he, unknown to his sister-in-law, put some grease inside the measure. The trick succeeded, for on getting it back he found a piece of gold sticking to it. Filled with astonishment, he could only suppose his brother had joined a band of robbers; so he hurried to his brother's cottage, and threatened to bring him before the Justice of the Peace if he did not confess where the gold came from. The poor man was troubled, and, dreading to offend his brother, told the story of his journey to the Crystal Mountain. Now the elder brother had plenty of money for himself, yet he was envious of the brother's good fortune, and be came greatly displeased when he found that his brother won every one's esteem by the good use he made of his wealth. At last he determined to visit the Crystal Mountain himself. 'I may meet with as good luck as my brother,' said he to himself. Upon reaching the Crystal Mountain he found the twelve seated round the fire as before, and thus addressed them: 'I beg of you, good people, to let me warm myself, for it is bitterly cold, and I am poor and homeless.' But one of them replied, 'My son, the hour of thy birth was favourable; thou art rich, but a miser; thou art wicked, for thou hast dared to lie to us. Well dost thou deserve thy punishment.' Amazed and terrified he stood silent, not daring to speak. Meanwhile the twelve changed places one after another, each at last returning to his own seat. Then from the midst of the flames arose the white-bearded old man and spoke thus sternly to the rich man: 'Woe unto the wilful! Thy brother is virtuous, therefore have I blessed him. As for thee, thou art wicked, and so shall not escape our vengeance.' At these words the twelve arose. The first seized the unfortunate man, struck him, and passed him on to the second; the second also struck him and passed him on to the third; and so did they all in their turn, until he was given up to the old man, who disappeared with him into the fire. Days, weeks, months went by, but the rich man never returned, and none knew what had become of him. I think, between you and me, the younger brother had his suspicions but he very wisely kept them to himself.", "title": "The Two Brothers", "id": 446}
{"label": "440", "text": "The oldest asked for a silk dress, 'and it must be made of three kinds of silk.' The second desired a feathered hat, 'and it must have three kinds of feathers.' The youngest finally said, 'Bring me a rose, dear father, and it must be fresh and have three colors.' The merchant promised to do this, kissed his daughters, and departed. After arriving in the foreign land, he ordered the dress of three kinds of silk for his oldest daughter and the hat with three kinds of feathers for the second one. Both were soon finished, and of seldom splendor. Then he sent messengers throughout the entire country to seek a three-colored rose for his youngest and dearest daughter, but they all returned empty handed, even though the merchant had promised a high price, and even though there were more roses there than there are daisies here. Sadly he set off for home and was downhearted the entire voyage. This side of the ocean he came to a large garden in which there was nothing but roses and roses. He went inside and looked, and behold, on a slender bush in the middle of the garden there was a three-colored rose. Filled with joy, he plucked it, and was about to leave, when he was magically frozen in place. A voice behind him cried out, 'What do you want in my garden?' He looked up. A large frog was sitting there on the bank of a clear pond staring at him with its goggle-eyes. It said, 'You have broken my dear rose. This will cost you your life unless you give me your youngest daughter to wife.' The merchant was terrified. He begged and he pleaded, but all to no avail, and in the end he had to agree to marry his dearest daughter to the ugly frog. He could now move his feet, and he freely walked out of the garden. The frog called out after him, 'In seven days I shall come for my wife!' With great sorrow the merchant gave his youngest daughter the fresh rose and told her what had happened. When the terrible day arrived, she crept under her bed, for she did not at all want to go. At the hour of noon a stately carriage drove up. The frog sent his servants into the house, and they immediately went to the bedroom and dragged the screaming maiden from beneath her bed, then carried her to the carriage. The horses leaped forward, and a short time later they were in the blossoming rose garden. In the middle of the garden, immediately behind the clear pond, there stood a small house. They took the bride into the house and laid her on a soft bed. The frog, however, sprang into the water. Darkness fell, and after the maiden had awakened from her unconsciousness, she heard the frog outside singing wonderfully sweet melodies. As midnight approached, he sang ever more sweetly, and came closer and closer to her. At midnight the bedroom door opened, and the frog jumped onto her bed. However, he had touched her with his sweet songs, and she took him into bed with her and warmly covered him up. The next morning when she opened her eyes, behold, the ugly frog was now the handsomest prince in the world. He thanked her with all his heart, saying, 'You have redeemed me and are now my wife!' And they lived long and happily together.", "title": "The Enchanted Frog", "id": 447}

{"label": "954", "text": "But the woman whom Ali Baba had married was poor and needy; they lived, therefore, in a mean hovel and Ali Baba eked out a scanty livelihood by the sale of fuel which he daily collected in the jungle and carried about the town to the Bazar upon his three asses. Now it chanced one day that Ali Baba had cut dead branches and dry fuel sufficient for his need, and had placed the load upon his beasts when suddenly he espied a dust-cloud spireing high in air to his right and moving rapidly towards him; and when he closely considered it he descried a troop of horsemen riding on amain and about to reach him. At this sight he was sore alarmed, and fearing lest perchance they were a band of bandits who would slay him and drive off his donkeys, in his affright he began to run; but forasmuch as they were near hand and he could not escape from out the forest, he drove his animals laden with the fuel into a bye-way of the bushes and swarmed up a thick trunk of a huge tree to hide himself therein; and he sat upon a branch whence he could descry everything beneath him whilst none below could catch a glimpse of him above; and that tree grew close beside a rock which towered high above-head. The horsemen, young, active, and doughty riders, came close up to the rock-face and all dismounted; whereat Ali Baba took good note of them and soon he was fully persuaded by their mien and demeanour that they were a troop of highwaymen who, having fallen upon a caravan had despoiled it and carried off the spoil and brought their booty to this place with intent of concealing it safely in some cache. Moreover he observed that they were forty in number. Ali Baba saw the robbers, as soon as they came under the tree, each unbridle his horse and hobble it; then all took off their saddle-bags which proved to be full of gold and silver. The man who seemed to be the captain presently pushed forwards, load on shoulder, through thorns and thickets, till he came up to a certain spot where he uttered these strange words, 'Open, O Simsim I' and forthwith appeared a wide doorway in the face of the rock. The robbers went in and last of all their Chief and then the portal shut of itself. Long while they stayed within the cave whilst Ali Baba was constrained to abide perched upon the tree, reflecting that if he came down peradventure the band might issue forth that very moment and seize him and slay him. At last he had determined to mount one of the horses and driving on his asses to return townwards, when suddenly the portal flew open. The robber-chief was first to issue forth; then, standing at the entrance, he saw and counted his men as they came out, and lastly he spake the magical words, 'Shut, O Simsim!' whereat the door closed of itself. When all had passed muster and review, each slung on his saddle-bags and bridled his own horse and as soon as ready they rode off, led by the leader, in the direction whence they came. Ali Baba remained still perched on the tree and watched their departure; nor would he descend until what time they were clean gone out of sight, lest perchance one of them return and look around and descry him. Then he thought within himself, 'I too will try the virtue of those magical words and see if at my bidding the door will open and close.' So he called out aloud, 'Open, O Simsim!' And no sooner had he spoken than straightway the portal flew open and he entered within. He saw a large cavern and a vaulted, in height equalling the stature of a full-grown man and it was hewn in the live stone and lighted up with light that came through air-holes and bullseyes in the upper surface of the rock which formed the roof. He had expected to find naught save outer gloom in this robbers' den, and he was surprised to see the whole room filled with bales of all manner stuffs, and heaped up from sole to ceiling with camel-loads of silks and brocades and embroidered cloths and mounds on mounds of vari-coloured carpetings; besides which he espied coins golden and silvern without measure or account, some piled upon the ground and others bound in leathern bags and sacks. Seeing these goods and moneys in such abundance, Ali Baba determined in his mind that not during a few years only but for many generations thieves must have stored their gains and spoils in this place. When he stood within the cave, its door had closed upon him, yet he was not dismayed since, he had kept in memory the magical words; and he took no heed of the precious stuffs around him, but applied himself only and wholly to the sacks of Ashrafis. Of these he carried out as many as he judged sufficient burthen for the beasts; then he loaded them upon his animals, and covered this plunder with sticks and fuel, so none might discern the bags, but might think that he was carrying home his usual ware. Lastly he called out, 'Shut, O Simsim!' and forthwith the door closed, for the spell so wrought that whensoever any entered the cave, its portal shut of itself behind him; and, as he issued therefrom, the same would neither open nor close again till he had pronounced the words, 'Shut, O Simsim!' Presently, having laden his asses Ali Baba urged them before him with all speed to the city and reaching home he drove them into the yard; and, shutting close the outer door, took down first the sticks and fuel and after the bags of gold which he carried in to his wife. She felt them and finding them full of coin suspected that Ali Baba had been robbing and fell to berating and blaming him for that he should do so ill a thing. Then quoth Ali Baba to his wife: 'Indeed I am no robber but rather do thou rejoice with me at our good fortune.' Hereupon he told her of his adventure and began to pour the gold from the bags in heaps before her, and her sight was dazzled by the sheen and her heart delighted at his recital and adventures. Then she began counting the gold, whereat quoth Ali Baba, 'O silly woman, how long wilt thou continue turning over the coin? Now let me dig a hole wherein to hide this treasure that none may know its secret.' Quoth she, 'Right is thy rede! still would I weigh the moneys and have some inkling of their amount;' and he replied, 'As thou pleasest, but see thou tell no man.' So she went off in haste to Kasim's home to borrow weights and scales wherewith she might balance the Ashrafis and make some reckoning of their value; and when she could not find Kaim she said to his wife, 'Lend me, I pray thee, thy scales for a moment.' Replied her sister-in-law, 'Hast thou need of the bigger balance or the smaller?' and the other rejoined, 'I need not the large scales, give me the little;' and her sister-in-law cried, 'Stay here a moment whilst I look about and find thy want.' With this pretext Kasim's wife went aside and secretly smeared wax and suet over the pan of the balance, that she might know what thing it was Ali Baba's wife would weigh, for she made sure that whatso it be some bit thereof would stick to the wax and fat. So the woman took this opportunity to satisfy her curiosity, and Ali Baba's wife suspecting naught thereof carried home the scales and began to weigh the gold, whilst Ali Baba ceased not digging; and, when the money was weighed, they twain stowed it into the hole which they carefully filled up with earth. Then the good wife took back the scales to her kinswoman, all unknowing that an Ashrafi had adhered to the cup of the scales; but when Kasim's wife espied the gold coin she fumed with envy and wrath, saying to herself, 'So ho! they borrowed my balance to weigh out Ashrafis?' and she marvelled greatly whence so poor a man as Ali Baba had gotten such store of wealth that he should be obliged to weigh it with a pair of scales. Now after long pondering the matter, when her husband returned home at eventide, she said to him, 'O man, thou deemest thyself a wight of wealth and substance, but lo, thy brother Ali Baba is an Emir by the side of thee and richer far than thou art. He hath such heaps of gold that he must needs weigh his moneys with scales, whilst thou, forsooth, art satisfied to count thy coin.' 'Whence knowe'st thou this?' asked Kasim, and in answer his wife related all anent the pair of scales and how she found an Ashrafi stuck to them, and shewed him the gold coin which bore the mark and superscription of some ancient king. No sleep had Kasim all that night by reason of his envy and jealousy and covetise; and next morning he rose betimes and going to Ali Baba said, 'O my brother, to all appearance thou art poor and needy; but in effect thou hast a store of wealth so abundant that perforce thou must weigh thy gold with scales.' Quoth Ali Baba, 'What is this thou sayest? I understand thee not; make clear thy purport;' and quoth Kasim with ready rage, 'Feign not that thou art ignorant of what I say and think not to deceive me.' Then showing him the Ashrafi he cried, 'Thousands of gold coins such as these thou hast put by; and meanwhile my wife found this one stuck to the cup of the scales.' Then Ali Baba understood how both Kasim and his wife knew that he had store of Ashrafis, and said in his mind that it would not avail him to keep the matter hidden, but would rather cause ill-will and mischief; and thus he was induced to tell his brother every whit concerning the bandits and also of the treasure trove in the cave. When he had heard the story, Kasim exclaimed, 'I would fain learn of thee the certainty of the place where them foundest the moneys; also the magical words whereby the door opened and closed; and I forewarn thee an thou tell me not the whole truth, I will give notice of those Ashrafis to the Wali; then shalt thou forfeit all thy wealth and be disgraced and thrown into gaol.' Thereupon Ali Baba told him his tale not forgetting the magical words; and Kasim who kept careful heed of all these matters next day set out, driving ten mules he had hired, and readily found the place which Ali Baba had described to him. And when he came to the aforesaid rock and to the tree whereon Ali Baba had hidden himself, and he had made sure of the door he cried in great joy, 'Open, O Simsim!' The portal yawned wide at once and Kasim went within and saw the piles of jewels and treasures lying ranged all around; and, as soon as he stood amongst them the door shut after him as wont to do. He walked about in ecstasy marvelling at the treasures, and when weary of admiration he gathered together bags of Ashrafis, a sufficient load for his ten mules, and placed them by the entrance in readiness to be carried outside and set upon the beasts. But by the will of Allah Almighty he had clean forgotten the cabalistic words and cried out, 'Open, O Barley!' whereat the door refused to move. Astonished and confused beyond measure he named the names of all manner of grains save sesame, which had slipped from his memory as though he had never heard the word; whereat in his dire distress he heeded not the Ashrafis that lay heaped at the entrance and paced to and fro, backwards and forwards, within the cave sorely puzzled and perplexed. The wealth whose sight had erewhile filled his heart with joy and gladness was now the cause of bitter grief and sadness. Kasini gave up all hope of the life which he by his greed and envy had so sore imperilled. It came to pass that at noontide the robbers, returning by that way, saw from afar some mules standing beside the entrance and much they marvelled at what had brought the beasts to that place; for, inasmuch as Kasim by mischance had failed to tether or hobble them, they had strayed about the jungle and were browsing hither and thither. However, the thieves paid scant regard to the estrays nor cared they to secure them, but only wondered by what means they had wandered so far from the town. Then, reaching the cave the Captain and his troop dismounted and going up to the door repeated the formula and at once it flew open. Now Kasim had heard from within the cave the horse-hooves drawing nigh and yet nigher; and he fell down to the ground in a fit of fear never doubting that it was the clatter of the banditti who would slaughter him without fail. Howbeit he presently took heart of grace and at the moment when the door flew open he rushed out hoping to make good his escape. But the unhappy ran full tilt against the Captain who stood in front of the band, and felled him to the ground; whereupon a robber standing near his chief at once bared his brand and with one cut clave Kasim clean in twain. Thereupon the robbers rushed into the cavern, and put back as they were before the bags of Ashrafis which Kasim had heaped up at the doorway ready for taking away; nor recked they aught of those which Ali Baba had removed, so dazed and amazed were they to discover by what means the strange man had effected an entrance. All knew that it was not possible for any to drop through the skylights so tall and steep was the rock's face, withal slippery of ascent; and also that none could enter by the portal unless he knew the magical words whereby to open it. However they presently quartered the dead body of Kasim and hung it to the door within the cavern, two parts to the right jamb and as many to the left that the sight might be a warning of approaching doom for all who dared enter the cave. Then coming out they closed the hoard door and rode away upon their wonted work. Now when night fell and Kasim came not home, his wife waxed uneasy in mind and running round to Ali Baba said, 'O my brother, Kasim hath not returned: thou knowest whither he went, and sore I fear me some misfortune hath betided him.' Ali Baba also divined that a mishap had happened to prevent his return; not the less, however, he strove to comfort his sister-in-law with words of cheer and said, 'O wife of my brother, Kasim haply exerciseth discretion and, avoiding the city, cometh by a roundabout road and will be here anon. This, I do believe, is the reason why he tarrieth.' Thereupon comforted in spirit Kasim's wife fared homewards and sat awaiting her husband's return; but when half the night was spent and still he came not, she was as one distraught. She feared to cry aloud for her grief, lest haply the neighbours hearing her should come and learn the secret; so she wept in silence and upbraiding herself fell to thinking, 'Wherefore did I disclose this secret to him and beget envy and jealousy of Ali Baba? this be the fruit thereof and hence the disaster that hath come down upon me.' She spent the rest of the night in bitter tears and early on the morrow hied in hottest hurry to Ali Baba and prayed that he would go forth in quest of his brother; so he strove to console her and straightway set out with his asses for the forest. Presently, reaching the rock he wondered to see stains of blood freshly shed and not finding his brother or the ten mules he forefelt a calamity from so evil a sign. He then went to the door and saving, 'Open, O Simsim!' he pushed in and saw the dead body of Kasim, two parts hanging to the right, and the rest to the left of the entrance. Albeit he was affrighted beyond measure of affright he wrapped the quarters in two cloths and laid them upon one of his asses, hiding them carefully with sticks and fuel that none might see them. Then he placed the bags of gold upon the two other animals and likewise covered them most carefully; and, when all was made ready he closed the cave-door with the magical words, and set him forth wending homewards with all ward and watchfulness. The asses with the load of Ashrafis he made over to his wife and bade her bury the bags with diligence; but he told her not the condition in which he had come upon his brother Kasim, Then he went with the other ass, to wit, the beast whereon was laid the corpse to the widow's house and knocked gently at the door. Now Kasim had a slave-girl shrewd and sharp-witted, Morgiana hight. She as softly undid the bolt and admitted Ali Baba and the ass into the courtyard of the house, when he let down the body from the beast's back and said, 'O Morgiana, haste thee and make thee ready to perform the rites for the burial of thy lord: I now go to tell the tidings to thy mistress and I will quickly return to help thee in this matter.' At that instant Kasim's widow seeing her brother-in-law, exclaimed, 'O Ali Baba, what news bringest thou of my spouse? Alas, I see grief tokens written upon thy countenance. Say quickly what hath happened.' Then he recounted to her how it had fared with her husband and how he had been slain by the robbers and in what wise he had brought home the dead body. Ali Baba pursued: 'O my lady, what was to happen hath happened, but it behoveth us to keep this matter secret, for that our lives depend upon privacy.' She wept with sore weeping and made answer, 'It hath fared with my husband according to the fiat of Fate; and now for thy safety's sake I give thee my word to keep the affair concealed.' He replied, 'Naught can avail when Allah hath decreed. Rest thee in patience; until the days of thy widowhood be accomplisht; after which time I will take thee to wife, and thou shalt live in comfort and happiness; and fear not lest my first spouse vex thee or show aught of jealousy, for that she is kindly and tender of heart.' The widow lamenting her loss noisily, cried, 'Be it as e'en thou please.' Then Ali Baba farewelled her, weeping and wailing for her husband; and joining Morgiana took counsel with her how to manage the burial of his brother. So, after much consultation and many warnings, he left the slave-girl and departed home driving his ass before him. As soon as Ali Baba had fared forth Morgiana went quickly to a druggist's shop; and, that she might the better dissemble with him and not make known the matter, she asked of him a drug often administered to men when diseased with dangerous distemper. He gave it saying, 'Who is there in thy house that lieth so ill as to require this medicine?' and said she, 'My Master Kasim is sick well nigh unto death: for many days he hath nor spoken nor tasted aught of food, so that almost we despair of his life.' Next day Morgiana went again and asked the druggist for more of medicine and essences such as are adhibited to the sick when at door of death, that the moribund may haply rally before the last breath. The man gave the potion and she taking it sighed aloud and wept, saying, 'I fear me he may not have strength to drink this draught: methinks all will be over with him ere I return to the house.' Meanwhile Ali Baba was anxiously awaiting to hear sounds of wailing and lamentation in Kasim's home that he might at such signal hasten thither and take part in the ceremonies of the funeral. Early on the second day Morgiana went with veiled face to one Baba Mustafa, a tailor well shotten in years whose craft was to make shrouds and cerecloths; and as soon as she saw him open his shop she gave him a gold piece and said, 'Do thou bind a bandage over thine eyes and come along with me.' Mustafa made as though he would not go, whereat Morgiana placed a second gold coin in his palm and entreated him to accompany her. The tailor presently consented for greed of gain, so tying a kerchief tightly over his eyes she led him by the hand to the house wherein lay the dead body of her master. Then, taking off the bandage in the darkened room she bade him sew together the quarters of the corpse, limb to its limb; and, casting a cloth upon the body, said to the tailor, 'Make haste and sew a shroud according to the size of this dead man and I will give thee therefor yet another ducat.' Baba Mustafa quickly made the cere cloth of fitting length and breadth, and Morgiana paid him the promised Ashrafi; then once more bandaging his eyes led him back to the place whence she had brought him. After this she returned hurriedly home and with the help of Ali Baba washed the body, in warm water and donning the shroud lay the corpse upon a clean place ready for burial. This done Morgiana went to the mosque and gave notice to an Imam that a funeral was awaiting the mourners in a certain household, and prayed that he would come to read the prayers for the dead; and the Imam went back with her. Then four neighbours took up the bier and bore it on tneir shoulders and fared forth with the Imam and others who were wont to give assistance at such obsequies. After the funeral prayers were ended four other men carried off the coffin; and Morgiana walked before it bare of head, striking her breast and weeping and wailing with exceeding loud lament, whilst Ali Baba and the neighbours came behind. In such order they entered the cemetery and buried him; then, leaving him to Munkar and Nakir -- the Questioners of the Dead -- all wended their ways. Presently the women of the quarter, according to the custom of the city, gathered together in the house of mourning and sat an hour with Kasim's widow comforting and condoling, presently leaving her somewhat resigned and cheered. Ali Baba stayed forty days at home in ceremonial lamentation for the loss of his brother; so none within the town save himself and his wife (Kasim's widow) and Morgiana knew aught about the secret. And when the forty days of mourning were ended Ali Baba removed to his own quarters all the property belonging to the deceased and openly married the widow; then he appointed his nephew, his brother's eldest son, who had lived a long time with a wealthy merchant and was perfect of knowledge in all matters of trade, such as selling and buying, to take charge of the defunct's shop and to carry on the business. It so chanced one day when the robbers, as was their wont, came to the treasurecave that they marvelled exceedingly to find nor sign nor trace of Kasim's body whilst they observed that much of gold had been carried off. Quoth the Captain, 'Now it behoveth us to make enquiry in this matter; else shall we suffer much of loss arid this our treasure, which we and our forefathers have amassed during the course of many years, will little by little be wasted and spoiled.' Hereto all assented and with single mind agreed that he whom they had slain had knowledge of the magical words whereby the door was made to open; moreover that some one beside him had cognizance of the spell and had carried off the body, and also much of gold; wherefore they needs must make diligent research and find out who the man ever might be. They then took counsel and determined that one amongst them, who should be sagacious and deft of wit, must don the dress of some merchant from foreign parts; then, repairing to the city he must go about from quarter to quarter and from street to street, and learn if any townsman had lately died and if so where he wont to dwell, that with this clue they might be enabled to find the wight they sought. Hereat said one of the robbers, 'Grant me leave that I fare and find out such tidings in the town and bring thee word anon; and if I fail of my purpose I hold my life in forfeit.' Accordingly that bandit, after disguising himself by dress, pushed at night into the town and next morning early he repaired to the market-square and saw that none of the shops had yet been opened, save only that of Baba Mustafa the tailor, who thread and needle in hand sat upon his working-stool. The thief bade him good day and said, ''Tis yet dark: how canst thou see to sew?' Said the tailor, 'I perceive thou art a stranger. Despite my years my eyesight is so keen that only yesterday I sewed together a dead body whilst sitting in a room quite darkened.' Quoth the bandit thereupon to himself, 'I shall get somewhat of my want from this snip;' and to secure a further clue he asked, 'Meseemeth thou wouldst jest with me and thou meanest that a cerecloth for a corpse was stitched by thee and that thy business is to sew shrouds.' Answered the tailor, 'It mattereth not to thee: question me no more questions.' Thereupon the robber placed an Ashrafi in his hand and continued, 'I desire not to discover aught thou hidest, albeit my breast like every honest man's is the grave of secrets; and this only would I learn of thee, in what house didst thou do that job? Canst thou direct me thither, or thyself conduct me thereto?' The tailor took the gold with greed and cried, 'I have not seen with my own eyes the way to that house. A certain bondswoman led me to a place which I know right well and there she bandaged my eyes and guided me to some tenement and lastly carried me into a darkened room where lay the dead body dismembered. Then she unbound the kerchief and bade me sew together first the corpse and then the shroud, which having done she again blindfolded me and led me back to the stead whence she had brought me and left me there. Thou seest then I am not able to tell thee where thou shalt find the house.' Quoth the robber, 'Albeit thou knowest not the dwelling whereof thou speakest, still canst thou take me to the place where thou wast blindfolded; then I will bind a kerchief over thine eyes and lead thee as thou wast led: on this wise perchance thou mayest hit upon the site. An thou wilt do this favour by me, see here another golden ducat is thine.' Thereupon the bandit slipped a second Ashrafi into the tailor's palm, and Baba Mustafa thrust it with the first into his pocket; then, leaving his shop as it was, he walked to the place where Morgiana had tied the kerchief around his eyes, and with him went the robber who, after binding on the bandage, led him by the hand. Baba Mustafa, who was clever and keen-witted, presently striking the street whereby he had fared with the handmaid, walked on counting step by step; then, halting suddenly, he said, 'Thus far I came with her;' and the twain stopped in front of Kasim's house wherein now dwelt his brother Ali Baba. The robber then made marks with white chalk upon the door to the end that he might readily find it at some future time, and removing the bandage from the tailor's eyes said, 'O Baba Mustafa, I thank thee for this favour: and Almighty Allah guerdon thee for thy goodness. Tell me now, I pray thee, who dwelleth in yonder house?' Quoth he, 'In very sooth I wot not, for I have little knowledge concerning this quarter of the city;' and the bandit, understanding that he could find no further clue from the tailor, dismissed him to his shop with abundant thanks, and hastened back to the tryst-place in the jungle where the band awaited his coming. Not long after it so fortuned that Morgiana, going out upon some errand, marvelled exceedingly at seeing the chalk-marks showing white in the door; she stood awhile deep in thought and presently divined that some enemy had made the signs that he might recognize the house and play some sleight upon her lord. She therefore chalked the doors of all her neighbours in like manner and kept the matter secret, never entrusting it or to master or to mistress. Meanwhile the robber told his comrades his tale of adventure and how he had found the clue; so the Captain and with him all the band went one after other by different ways till they entered the city ; and he who had placed the mark on Ali Baba's door accompanied the Chief to point out the place. He conducted him straightway to the house and shewing the sign exclaimed, 'Here dwelleth he of whom we are in search!' But when the Captain looked around him he saw that all the dwellings bore chalk-marks after like fashion and he wondered saying, 'By what manner of means knowest thou which house of all these houses that bear similar signs is that whereof thou spakest?' Hereat the robber-guide was confounded beyond measure of confusion, and could make no answer; then with an oath he cried, 'I did assuredly set a sign upon a door, but I know not whence came all the marks upon the other entrances; nor can I say for a surety which it was I chalked.' Thereupon the Captain returned to the market-place and said to his men, 'We have toiled and laboured in vain, nor have we found the house we went forth to seek. Return we now to the forest our rendezvous: I also will fare thither.' Then all trooped off and assembled together within the treasure-cave; and, when the robbers had all met, the Captain judged him worthy of punishment who had spoken falsely and had led them through the city to no purpose. So he imprisoned him in presence of them all; and then said he, 'To him amongst you will I show special favour who shall go to town and bring me intelligence whereby we may lay hands upon the plunderer of our property.' Hereat another of the company came forward and said, 'I am ready to go and enquire into the case, and 'tis I who will bring thee to thy wish.' The Captain after giving him presents and promises despatched him upon his errand; and by the decree of Destiny which none may gainsay, this second robber went first to the house of Baba Mustafa the tailor, as had done the thief who had foregone him. In like manner he also persuaded the snip with gifts of golden coin that he be led hoodwinked and thus too he was guided to Ali Baba's door. Here noting the work of his predecessor, he affixed to the jamb a mark with red chalk the better to distinguish it from the others whereon still showed the white. Then hied he back in stealth to his company; but Morgiana on her part also descried the red sign on the entrance and with subtle forethought marked all the others after the same fashion; nor told she any what she had done. Meanwhile the bandit rejoined his band and vauntingly said, 'O our Captain, I have found the house and thereon put a mark whereby I shall distinguish it clearly from all its neighbours.' The Captain despatched another of his men to the city and he found the place, but, as aforetime, when the troop repaired thither they saw each and every house marked with signs of red chalk. So they returned disappointed and the Captain, waxing displeased exceedingly and distraught, clapped also this spy into gaol. Then said the chief to himself, 'Two men have failed in their endeavour and have met their rightful meed of punishment; and I trow that none other of my band will essay to follow up their research; so I myself will go and find the house of this wight.' Accordingly he fared along and aided by the tailor Baba Mustafa, who had gained much gain of golden pieces in this matter, he hit upon the house of Ali Baba; and here he made no outward show or sign, but marked it on the tablet of his heart and impressed the picture upon the page of his memory. Then returning to the jungle he said to his men, 'I have full cognizance of the place and have limned it clearly in my mind ; so now there will be no difficulty in finding it. Go forth straightways and buy me and bring hither nineteen mules together with one large leathern jar of mustard oil and seven and thirty vessels of the same kind clean empty. Without me and the two locked up in gaol ye number thirty-seven souls; so I will stow you away armed and accoutred each within his jar and will load two upon each mule, and upon the nineteenth mule there shall be a man in an empty jar on one side, and on the other the jar full of oil. I for my part, in guise of an oil-merchant, will drive the mules into the town, arriving at the house by night, and will ask permission of its master to tarry there until morning. After this we shall seek occasion during the dark hours to rise up and fall upon him and slay him.' Furthermore the Captain spake saying, 'When we have made an end of trim we shall recover the gold and treasure whereof he robbed us and bring it back upon the mules.' This counsel pleased the robbers who went forthwith and purchased mules and huge leathern jars, and did as the Captain had bidden them. And after a delay of three days shortly before nightfall they arose; and over-smearing all the jars with oil of mustard, each hid him inside an empty vessel. The Chief then disguised himself in trader's gear and placed the jars upon the nineteen mules; to wit, the thirty-seven vessels in each of which lay a robber armed and accoutred, and the one that was full of oil. This done, he drove the beasts before him and presently he reached Ali Baba's place at nightfall; when it chanced that the house-master was strolling after supper to and fro in front of his home. The Captain saluted him with the salam and said, 'I come from such and such a village with oil; and ofttimes have I been here a-selling oil, but now to my grief I have arrived too late and I am sore troubled and perplexed as to where I shall spend the night. An thou have pity on me I pray thee grant that I tarry here in thy courtyard and ease the mules by taking down the jars and giving the beasts somewhat of fodder.' Albeit Ali Baba had heard the Captain's voice when perched upon the tree and had seen him enter the cave, yet by reason of the disguise he knew him not for the leader of the thieves, and granted his request with hearty welcome and gave him full license to halt there for the night. He then pointed out an empty shed wherein to tether the mules, and bade one of the slave-boys go fetch grain and water. He also gave orders to the slave-girl Morgiana saying, 'A guest hath come hither and tarrieth here to-night. Do thou busy thyself with all speed about his supper and make ready the guestbed for him.' Presently, when the Captain had let down all the jars and had fed and watered his mules, Ali Baba received him with all courtesy and kindness, and summoning Morgiana said in his presence, 'See thou fail not in service of this our stranger nor suffer him to lack for aught. To-morrow early I would fare to the Hammam and bathe; so do thou give my slave-boy Abdullah a suit of clean white clothes which I may put on after washing; moreover make thee ready a somewhat of broth overnight that I may drink it after my return home.' Replied she, 'I will have all in readiness as thou hast bidden.' So Ali Baba retired to his rest, and the Captain, having supped, repaired to the shed and saw that all the mules had their food and drink for the night. The Captain, after seeing to the mules and the jars which Ali Baba and his household held to be full of oil, finding utter privacy, whispered to his men who were in ambush, 'This night at midnight when ye hear my voice, do you quickly open with your sharp knives the leathern jars from top to bottom and issue forth without delay.' Then passing through the kitchen he reached the chamber wherein a bed had been dispread for him, Morgiana showing the way with a lamp. Quoth she, 'An thou need aught beside I pray thee command this thy slave who is ever ready to obey thy say!' He made answer, 'Naught else need I;' then, putting out the light, he lay him down on the bed to sleep awhile ere the time came to rouse his men and finish off the work. Meanwhile Morgiana did as her master had bidden her: she first took out a suit of clean white clothes and made it over to Abdullah who had not yet gone to rest; then she placed the pipkin upon the hearth to boil the broth and blew the fire till it burnt briskly. After a short delay she needs must see an the broth be boiling, but by that time all the lamps had gone out and she found that the oil was spent and that nowhere could she get a light. The slave-boy Abdullah observed that she was troubled and perplexed hereat, and quoth he to her, 'Why make so much ado? In yonder shed are many jars of oil: go now and take as much soever as thou listest.' Morgiana gave thanks to him for his suggestion; and Abdullah, who was lying at his ease in the hall, went off to sleep so that he might wake betimes and serve Ali Baba in the bath. So the handmaiden rose and with oil-can in hand walked to the shed where stood the leathern jars all ranged in rows. Now, as she drew nigh unto one of the vessels, the thief who was hidden therein hearing the tread of footsteps bethought him that it was of his Captain whose summons he awaited; so he whispered, 'Is it now time for us to sally forth?' Morgiana started back affrighted at the sound of human accents; but, inasmuch as she was bold and ready of wit, she replied, 'The time is not yet come,' and said to herself, 'These jars are not full of oil and herein I perceive a manner of mystery. Haply the oil merchant hatcheth some treacherous plot against my lord; so Allah, the Compassionating, the Compassionate, protect us from his snares!' Wherefore she answered in a voice made like to the Captain's, 'Not yet, the time is not come.' Then she went to the next jar and returned the same reply to him who was within, and so on to all the vessels one by one. Then said she in herself, 'Laud to the Lord! my master took this fellow in believing him to be an oil-merchant, but lo, he hath admitted a band of robbers, who only await the signal to fall upon him and plunder the place and do him die.' Then passed she on to the furthest jar and finding it brimming with oil, filled her can, and returning to the kitchen, trimmed the lamp and lit the wicks; then, bringing forth a large cauldron, she set it upon the fire, and filling it with oil from out the jar heaped wood upon the hearth and fanned it to a fierce flame the readier to boil its contents. When this was done she baled it out in potfuls and poured it seething hot into the leathern vessels one by one while the thieves unable to escape were scalded to death and every jar contained a corpse. Thus did this slave-girl by her subtle wit make a clean end of all noiselessly and unknown even to the dwellers m the house. Now when she had satisfied herself that each and every of the men had been slain, she went back to the kitchen and shutting to the door sat brewing Ali Baba's broth. Scarce had an hour passed before the Captain woke from sleep; and, opening wide his window, saw that all was dark and silent; so he clapped his hands as a signal for his men to come forth but not a sound was heard in return. After awhile he clapped again and called aloud but got no answer; and when he cried out a third time without reply he was perplexed and went out to the shed wherein stood the jars. He thought to himself, 'Perchance all are fallen asleep whenas the time for action is now at hand, so I must e'en awaken them without stay or delay.' Then approaching the nearest jar he was startled by a smell of oil and seething flesh; and touching it outside he felt it reeking hot; then going to the others one by one, he found all in like condition. Hereat he knew for a surety the fate which had betided his band and, fearing for his own safety, he clomb on to the wall, and thence dropping into a garden made his escape in high dudgeon and sore disappointment. Morgiana awaited awhile to see the Captain return from the shed but he came not; whereat she knew that he had scaled the wall and had taken to flight, for that the street-door was double-locked; and the thieves being all disposed of on this wise Morgiana laid her down to sleep in perfect solace and ease of mind. When two hours of darkness yet remained, Ali Baba awoke and went to the Hammam knowing naught of the night-adventure, for the gallant slave-girl had not aroused him, nor indeed had she deemed such action expedient, because had she sought an opportunity of reporting to him her plan, she might haply have lost her chance and spoiled the project. The sun was high over the horizon when Ali Baba walked back from the Baths; and he marvelled exceedingly to see the jars still standing under the shed and said, 'How cometh it that he, the oil-merchant my guest, hath not carried to the market his mules and jars of oil?' Ali Baba presently asked Morgiana what had befallen the oil-merchant his guest whom he had placed under her charge; and she answered, 'Allah Almighty vouchsafe to thee six score years and ten of safety! I will tell thee in privacy of this merchant.' So Ali Baba went apart with his slave-girl, who taking him without the house first locked the court-door; then showing him a jar she said, 'Prithee look into this and see if within there be oil or aught else.' Thereupon peering inside it he perceived a man at which sight he cried aloud and fain would have fled in his fright. Quoth Morgiana, 'Fear him not, this man hath no longer the force to work thee harm, he lieth dead and stone-dead.' Hearing such words of comfort and reassurance Ali Baba asked, 'O Morgiana, what evils have we escaped and by what means hath this wretch become the quarry of Fate?' She answered 'Alhamdolillah -- Praise be to Almighty Allah! -- I will inform thee fully of the case; but hush thee, speak not aloud, lest haply the neighbours learn the secret and it end in our confusion. Look now into all the jars, one by one from first to last.' So Ali Baba examined them severally and found in each a man fully armed and accoutred and all lay scalded to death. Hereat speechless for sheer amazement he stared at the jars, but presently recovering himself he asked, 'And where is he, the oil-merchant?' Answered she, 'Of him also I will inform thee. The villain was no trader but a traitorous assassin whose honied words would have ensnared thee to thy doom; and now I will tell thee what he was and what hath happened; but, meanwhile thou art fresh from the Hammam and thou shouldst first drink somewhat of this broth for thy stomach's and thy health's sake.' So Ali Baba went within and Morgiana served up the mess; after which quoth her master, 'I fain would hear this wondrous story: prithee tell it to me and set my heart at ease.' Hereat the handmaid fell to relating whatso had betided in these words: Accordingly, I took a can and went to the first vessel when suddenly I heard a voice within whisper with all caution, 'Is it now time for us to sally forth?' I was amazed thereat and judged that the pretended merchant had laid some plot to slay thee; so I replied, 'The time is not yet come.' Then I went to the second jar and heard another voice to which I made the like answer, and so on with all of them. I now was certified that these men awaited only some signal from their Chief whom thou didst take to guest within thy walls supposing him to be a merchant in oil; and that after thou receivedst him hospitably the miscreant had brought these men to murther thee and to plunder thy good and spoil thy house. But I gave him no opportunity to win his wish. The last jar I found full of oil and taking somewhat therefrom I lit the lamp; then, putting a large cauldron upon the fire, I filled it up with oil which I brought from the jar and made a fierce blaze under it; and, when the contents were seething hot, I took out sundry cansful with intent to scald them all to death, and going to each jar in due order, I poured within them one by one boiling oil. On this wise having destroyed them utterly, I returned to the kitchen and having extinguished the lamps stood by the window watching what might happen, and how that false merchant would act next. Not long after I had taken my station, the robber-captain awoke and ofttimes signalled to his thieves. Then getting no reply he came downstairs and went out to the jars, and finding that all his men were slain he fled through the darkness I know not whither. So when he had clean disappeared I was assured that, the door being double-locked, he had scaled the wall and dropped into the garden and made his escape. Then with my heart at rest I slept. Morgiana continued to Ali Baba: 'Judge now and see if these signs and all this villainy be not the work of the bandits of the forest, who marked our house that on such wise they might know it again. Of these forty thieves there yet remain two others concerning whose case I know naught; so beware of them, but chiefly of the third remaining robber, their Captain, who fled hence alive. Take good heed and be thou cautious of him, for, shouldst thou fall into his hands, he will in no wise spare thee but will surely murther thee. I will do all that lieth in me to save from hurt and harm thy life and property, nor shall thy slave be found wanting in any service to my lord.' Hearing these words Ali Baba rejoiced with exceeding joyance and said to her, 'I am well pleased with thee for this thy conduct ; and say me what wouldst thou have me do in thy behalf; I shall not fail to remember thy brave deed so long as breath in me remaineth.' Quoth she, 'It behoveth us before all things forthright to bury these bodies in the ground, that so the secret be not known to any one.' Hereupon Ali Baba took with him his slave-boy Abdullah into the garden and there under a tree they dug for the corpses of the thieves a deep pit in size proportionate to its conterits, and they dragged, the bodies (having carried off their weapons) to the fosse and threw them in; then, covering up the remains of the seven and thirty robbers they made the ground appear level and clean as it wont to be. They also hid the leathern jars and the gear and arms and presently Ali Baba sent the mules by ones and twos to the bazar and sold them all with the able aid of his slave-boy Abdullah. Thus the matter wras hushed up nor did it reach the ears of any; however, Ali Baba ceased not to be ill at ease lest haply the Captain or the surviving two robbers should wreak their vengeance on his head. He kept himself private with all caution and took heed that none learn a word of what had happened and of the wealth which he had carried off from the bandits' cave. Meanwhile the Captain of the thieves having escaped with his life, fled to the forest in hot wrath and sore irk of mind; and his senses were scattered and the colour of his visage vanished like ascending smoke. Then he thought the matter over again and again, and at last he firmly resolved that he needs must take the life of Ali Baba, else he would lose all the treasure which his enemy, by knowledge of the magical words, would take away and turn to his own use. Furthermore, he determined that he would undertake the business single-handed; and, that after getting rid of Ali Baba, he would gather together another band of banditti and would pursue his career of brigandage, as indeed his forbears had done for many generations. So he lay down to rest that night, and rising early in the morning donned a dress of suitable appearance; then going to the city alighted at a caravanserai, thinking to himself, 'Doubtless the murther of so many men hath reached the Wali's ears, and Ali Baba hath been seized and brought to justice, and his house is levelled and his good is confiscated. The townfolk must surely have heard tidings of these matters.' So he straightway asked of the keeper of the Khan, 'What strange things have happened in the city during the last few days?' and the other told him all that he had seen and heard, but the Captain could not learn a whit of that which most concerned him. Hereby he understood that Ali Baba was ware and wise, and that he had not only carried away such store of treasure but he had also destroyed so many lives and withal had come off scatheless; furthermore, that he himself must needs have all his wits alert not to fall into the hands of his foe and perish. With this resolve the Captain hired a shop in the Bazar, whither he bore whole bales of the finest stuffs and goodly merchandise from his forest treasure-house; and presently he took his seat within the store and fell to doing merchant's business. By chance his place fronted the booth of the defunct Kasim where his son, Ali Baba's nephew, now traded; and the Captain, who called himself Khwajah Hasan soon formed acquaintance and friendship with the shopkeepers around about him and treated all with profuse civilities, but he was especially gracious and cordial to the son of Kasim, a handsome youth and a well-dressed, and ofttimes he would sit and chat with him for a long while. A few days after it chanced that Ali Baba, as he was sometime wont to do, came to see his nephew, whom he found sitting in his shop. The Captain saw and recognised him at sight and one morning he asked the young man, saying, 'Prithee tell me, who is he that ever and anon cometh to thee at thy place of sale?' whereto the youth made answer, 'He is my uncle, the brother of my father.' Whereupon the Captain showed him yet greater favour and affection the better to deceive him for his own devices, and gave him presents and made him sit at meat with him and fed him with the daintiest of dishes. Presently Ali Baba's nephew bethought him it was only right and proper that he also should invite the merchant to supper, but whereas his own house was small, and he was straitened for room and could not make a show of splendour, as did Khwajah Hasan, he took counsel with his uncle on the matter. Ali Baba replied to his nephew: 'Thou sayest well: it behoveth thee to entreat thy friend in fairest fashion even as he hath entreated thee. On the morrow, which is Friday, shut thy shop as do all merchants of repute; then, after the early meal, take Khwajah Hasan to smell the air,and as thou walkest lead him hither unawares; meanwhile I will give orders that Morgiana shall make ready for his coming the best of viands and all necessaries for a feast. Trouble not thyself on any wise, but leave the matter in my hands.' Accordingly on the next day, to wit, Friday, the nephew of Ali Baba took Khwajah Hasan to walk about the garden; and, as they were returning he led him by the street wherein his uncle dwelt. When they came to the house, the youth stopped at the door and knocking said, 'O my lord, this is my second home: my uncle hath heard much of thee and of thy goodness mewards and desireth with exceeding desire to see thee; so, shouldst thou consent to enter and visit him, I shall be truly glad and thankful to thee.' Albeit Khwajah Hasan rejoiced in heart that he had thus found means whereby he might have access to his enemy's house and household, and although he hoped soon to attain his end by treachery, yet he hesitated to enter in and stood to make his excuses and walk away. But when the door was opened by the slave-porter, Ali Baba's nephew seized his companion's hand and after abundant persuasion led him in, whereat he entered with great show of cheerfulness as though much pleased and honoured. The housemaster received him with all favour and worship and asked him of his welfare, and said to him, 'O my lord, I am obliged and thankful to thee for that thou hast shewn favour to the son of my brother and I perceive that thou regardest him with an affection even fonder than my own.' Khwajah Hasan replied with pleasant words and said, 'Thy nephew vastly taketh my fancy and in him I am well pleased, for that although young in years yet he hath been endued by Allah with much of wisdom.' Thus they twain conversed with friendly conversation and presently the guest rose to depart and said, 'O my lord, thy slave must now farewell thee; but on some future day Inshallah he will again wait upon thee,' Ali Baba, however, would not let him leave and asked, 'Whither wendest thou, my friend ? I would invite thee to my table and I pray thee sit at meat with us and after hie thee home in peace. Perchance the dishes are not as delicate as those whereof thou art wont to eat, still deign grant me this request I pray thee and refresh thyself with my victual.' Quoth Khwajah Hasan, 'O my lord I am beholden to thee for thy gracious invitation, and with pleasure would I sit at meat with thee, but for a special reason must I needs excuse myself; suffer me therefore to depart for I may not tarry longer nor accept thy gracious offer.' Hereto the host made reply, 'I pray thee, O my lord, tell me what may be the reason so urgent and weighty?' And Khwajah Hasan answered, 'The cause is this: I must not, by order of the physician, who cured me lately of my complaint, eat aught of food prepared with salt.' Quoth Ali Baba, 'An this be all, deprive me not, I pray thee, of the honour thy company will confer upon me: as the meats are not yet cooked, I will forbid the kitchener to make use of any salt. Tarry here awhile and I will return anon to thee.' So saying Ali Baba went in to Morgiana and bade her not put salt into any one of the dishes; and she, while busied with her cooking, fell to marvelling greatly at such order and asked her master, 'Who is he that eateth meat wherein is no salt?' He answered, 'What to thee mattereth it who he may be? Only do thou my bidding.' She rejoined, ''Tis well: all shall be as thou wishest;' but in mind she wondered at the man who made such strange request and desired much to look upon him. Wherefore, when all the meats were ready for serving up, she helped the slave-boy Abdullah to spread the table and set on the meal; and no sooner did she see Khwajah Hasan than she knew who he was, albeit he had disguised himself in the dress of a stranger merchant; furthermore, when she eyed him attentively she espied a dagger hidden under his robe. 'So ho!' quoth she to herself, 'this is the cause why the villain eateth not of salt, for that he seeketh an opportunity to slay my master whose mortal enemy he is; howbeit I will be beforehand with him and despatch him ere he find a chance to harm my lord.' Morgiana, having spread a white cloth upon the table and served up the meal, went back to the kitchen and thought out her plot against the robber-Captain. Now when Ali Baba and Khwajah Hasan had eaten their sufficiency, the slave-boy Abdullah brought Morgiana word to serve the dessert, and she cleared the table and set on fruit fresh and dried in salvers, then she placed by the side of Ali Baba a small tripod for three cups with a flagon of wine, and lastly she went off with the slave-boy Abdullah into another room, as though she would herself eat supper. Then Khwajah Hasan, that is, the Captain of the robbers, perceiving that the coast was clear, exulted mightily saying to himself, 'The time hath come for me to take full vengeance; with one thrust of my dagger I will despatch this fellow, then escape across the garden and wend my ways. His nephew will not adventure to stay my hand, for an he do but move a finger or toe with that intent another stab will settle his earthly account. Still must I wait awhile until the slave-boy and the cook-maid shall have eaten and lain down to rest them in the kitchen.' Morgiana, however, watched him wistfully and divining his purpose said in her mind, 'I must not allow this villain advantage over my lord, but by some means I must make void his project and at once put an end to the life of him.' Accordingly, the trusty slave-girl changed her dress with all haste and donned such clothes as dancers wear; she veiled her face with a costly kerchief; around her head she bound a fine turband, and about her middle she tied a waist-cloth worked with gold and silver wherein she stuck a dagger, whose hilt was rich in filigree and jewelry. Thus disguised she said to the slave-boy Abdullah, 'Take now thy tambourine that we may play and sing and dance in honour of our master's guest.' So he did her bidding and the twain went into the room, the lad playing and the lass following. Then, making a low congee, they asked leave to perform and disport and play; and Ali Baba gave permission, saying, 'Dance now and do your best that this our guest may be mirthful and merry.' Quoth Khwajah Hasan, 'O my lord, thou dost indeed provide much pleasant entertainment.' Then the slave-boy Abdullah standing by began to strike the tambourine whilst Morgiana rose up and showed her perfect art and pleased them vastly with graceful steps and sportive motion; and suddenly drawing the poniard from her belt she brandished it and paced from side to side, a spectacle which pleased them most of all. At times also she stood before them, now clapping the sharp-edged dagger under her armpit and then setting it against her breast. Lastly she took the tambourine from the slave-boy Abdullah, and still holding the poniard in her right she went round for largesse as is the custom amongst merry-makers. First she stood before Ali Baba who threw a gold coin into the tambourine, and his nephew likewise put in an Ashrafi; then Khwajah Hasan, seeing her about to approach him, fell to pulling out his purse, when she heartened her heart and quick as the blinding leven she plunged the dagger into his vitals, and forthwith the miscreant fell back stone-dead. Ali Baba was dismayed and cried in his wrath, 'O unhappy, what is this deed thou hast done to bring about my ruin!' But she replied, 'Nay, O my lord, rather to save thee and not to cause thee harm have I slain this man: loosen his garments and see what thou wilt discover thereunder.' So Ali Baba searched the dead man's dress and found concealed therein a dagger. Then said Morgiana, 'This wretch was thy deadly enemy. Consider him well: he is none other than the oil merchant, the Captain of the band of robbers. Whenas he came hither with intent to take thy life, he would not eat thy salt; and when thou toldest me that he wished not any in the meat I suspected him and at first sight I was assured that he would surely do thee die; Almighty Allah be praised 'tis even as I thought.' Then Ali Babi lavished upon her thanks and expressions of gratitude, saying, 'Lo, these two times hast thou saved me from his hand,' and falling upon her neck he cried, 'See thou art free, and as reward for this thy fealty I have wedded thee to my nephew.' Then turning to the youth he said, 'Do as I bid thee and thou shalt prosper. I would that thou marry Morgiana, who is a model of duty and loyalty: thou seest now yon Khwajah Hasan sought thy friendship only that he might find opportunity to take my life, but this maiden with her good sense and her wisdom hath slain him and saved us.' Ali Baba's nephew straightway consented to marry Morgiana. After which the three, raising the dead body bore it forth with all heed and vigilance and privily buried it in the garden, and for many years no one knew aught thereof. In due time Ali Baba married his brother's son to Morgiana with great pomp, and spread a bride-feast in most sumptuous fashion for his friends and neighbours, and made merry with them and enjoyed singing and all manner of dancing and amusements. He prospered in every undertaking and Time smiled upon him and a new source of wealth was opened to him. For fear of the thieves he had not once visited the jungle-cave wherein lay the treasure, since the day he had carried forth the corpse of his brother Kasim. But some time after, he mounted his hackney one morning and journeyed thither, with all care and caution, till finding no signs of man or horse, and reassured in his mind he ventured to draw near the door. Then alighting from his beast he tied it up to a tree, and going to the entrance pronounced the words which he had not forgotten, 'Open, O Simsim!' Hereat, as was its wont, the door flew open, and entering thereby he saw the goods and hoard of gold and silver untouched and lying as he had left them. So he felt assured that not one of all the thieves remained alive, and, that save himself there was not a soul who knew the secret of the place. At once he bound in his saddlecloth a load of Ashrafis such as his horse could bear and brought it home; and in after days he showed the hoard to his sons and sons' sons and taught them how the door could be caused to open and shut. Thus Ali Baba and his household lived all their lives in wealth and joyance in that city where erst he had been a pauper, and by the blessing of that secret treasure he rose to high degree and dignities.", "title": "Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves", "id": 449}

{"label": "327", "text": "Once upon a time there were a father and a mother who had two children, a girl and a boy. The girl's name was Gretel, and the boy's name was Hans. The children were disobedient, and often received beatings. One day they wanted to go into the woods to pick strawberries, but their mother said, 'You are not allowed to go out today. A thunderstorm is approaching, so you have to stay at home.' But the children did not obey. While their mother was busy working, the children took their little baskets from the wall and went into the woods. There they picked strawberries, but they had scarcely begun when it grew dark. A storm arose that whipped the trees fiercely against each other until the branches came flying down. It began to thunder and lightning, followed by hail and rain. The frightened children were sorry that they had not obeyed their mother and remained at home. Fortunately they found a rocky cave, and they crept inside and waited until the rain stopped. After the thunderstorm had passed, they wanted to go home, but -- oh dear -- they no longer knew the way. They walked and walked, but instead of going out of the woods, they only went deeper and deeper into the woods. They grew terribly afraid and called out, 'Father! Mother!' but no one heard them. Night fell, and they saw with terror that they would have to sleep in the woods. Then Gretel said, 'Hans, do you know what? Climb a tree. You like to climb trees, and you can look around. Maybe you'll see a light where we can go.' Hans did this, and he did indeed see a light in the distance. He came down from the tree, took Gretel by the hand, and led her in the direction of the light he had seen. When they arrived there, they saw a little house from which the light was glistening. Looking more closely, they found that it was made of gingerbread. The walls were of gingerbread and the roof of marzipan. They looked around for a ladder, and finding one, they leaned it on the roof and climbed up. There they made themselves comfortable and began breaking off one marzipan shingle after the other and eating them, until there was a hole clear through the roof. Now a witch named Grule lived in this little house, and she liked to eat children more than anything else. She was just about to go to bed when she heard something on her roof. Running outside, she said with a deep voice, 'Who is robbing my house?' 'The wind, the wind,' was Gretel's reply, with a very gentle voice. Satisfied, she went back inside and went to bed. In the meantime the moon had risen, and when the witch put out her light she noticed a large hole in the roof above her bed, and a child's head looking around. She jumped up, ran outside, pulled the children down from the roof, and said, 'Just wait, you worthless brats. I'll teach you to ruin my house. Get inside. You can't leave.' And with these words she put them in an empty chicken coop and locked the door. The next days, and for some time afterward, the witch brought the children good things to eat, for she wanted to fatten them up in order to have a good roast from them. She brought the children all the things they liked to eat: cake, sweets, fruit, and many other things. When she thought that the children must be fat enough, she took a knife to the coop. First she went to Gretel and said, 'Girl, stick out your little finger, but Gretel thought, 'No way,' and held out her apron string. Grule cut into it a little, and said, 'Skinny, skinny.' Then she went to Hans and said, 'Boy, stick out your little finger,' and Hans held out his trouser string. She likewise cut into it and said, 'Skinny, skinny,' then went away. After this she thought, 'What should I give the children to eat to make them fat? Good things don't make them fat. I'll try something else.' And from then on she gave them nothing but flour porridge, which the children soon grew to hate. Some time later the witch again came to the coop with a knife and said to Gretel, 'Girl, stick out your little finger,' and this time Gretel held out her finger. Old Grule cut into it a little, and a drop of blood appeared. Then the witch said, 'Fat, fat.' Then she went to Hans and told him to hold out his finger as well, which he did, just as Gretel had done. She cut into it too, and when it bled a little, she again said, 'Fat, fat.' She went to her kitchen and made a fire in her oven. After it had burned down she took a wooden crook and with it spread the coals evenly across the oven's entire surface. After a while she took a wet straw whisk and swept the coals to the front of the oven, then took them out. Then she went to the coop, opened it, and said, 'Come, children, I have some baked plums in the oven. You can get them out for me.' The two ran for joy into the kitchen with Old Grule, thinking that at last they were going to get something other than the eternal flour porridge. Arriving there, the witch got a baker's peel and told the children to sit on it, so she could push them into the oven. But while Grule was gone, Gretel looked into the oven and saw that there were no plums in it at all. So when Old Grule told her to sit on the peel first, she pretended to be so awkward that she fell off. Then she said, 'My dear Grule, I don't understand how I am supposed to sit on it. Show me, so I can see how.' Then Old Grule pulled her skirts together, sat down on the baker's peel, and said, 'See. This is how to do it.' And while she was thus sitting there, Gretel gave a sign to Hans, and bang, the children pushed the witch into the oven, and Old Grule burned up miserably. Gretel and Hans returned home. Their parents were very happy to see them, for they thought their children had died, but still each of them was given a beating for being disobedient.

{"label": "510A", "text": "So saying the aged man disappeared, and the girls, bewildered by his words, and discussing the strange incident, approached near to the ravine which had suddenly become interesting to them. They peered curiously over the edge, as though expecting to see some unaccustomed sight, when suddenly the most beautiful of the maidens let her spindle drop from her hand, and before she could recover it, it was bounding from rock to rock into the depths beneath. When she returned home that evening she found her worst fears realized, for her mother stood before the door transformed into a cow. A short time later her father married again. His new wife was a widow, and brought a daughter of her own into her new home. This girl was not particularly well favored, and her mother immediately began to hate her stepdaughter because of the latter's good looks. She forbade her henceforth to wash her face, to comb her hair or to change her clothes, and in every way she could think of she sought to make her miserable. One morning she gave her a bag filled with hemp, saying, 'If you do not spin this and make a fine top of it by tonight, you need not return home, for I intend to kill you.' The poor girl, deeply dejected, walked behind the cattle, industriously spinning as she went, but by noon when the cattle lay down in the shade to rest, she observed that she had made but little progress and she began to weep bitterly. Now, her mother was driven daily to pasture with the other cows, and seeing her daughter's tears she drew near and asked why she wept, whereupon the maiden told her all. Then the cow comforted her daughter, saying, 'My darling child, be consoled! Let me take the hemp into my mouth and chew it; through my ear a thread will come out. You must take the end of this and wind it into a top.' So this was done; the hemp was soon spun, and when the girl gave it to her stepmother that evening, she was greatly surprised. Next morning the woman roughly ordered the maiden to spin a still larger bag of hemp, and as the girl, thanks to her mother, spun and wound it all, her stepmother, on the following day, gave her twice the quantity to spin. Nevertheless, the girl brought home at night even that unusually large quantity well spun, and her stepmother concluded that the poor girl was not spinning alone, but that other maidens, her friends, were giving her help. Therefore she, next morning, sent her own daughter to spy upon the poor girl and to report what she saw. The girl soon noticed that the cow helped the poor orphan by chewing the hemp, while she drew the thread and wound it on a top, and she ran back home and informed her mother of what she had seen. Upon this, the stepmother insisted that her husband should order that particular cow to be slaughtered. Her husband at first hesitated, but as his wife urged him more and more, he finally decided to do as she wished. On learning what had been decided, the stepdaughter wept more than ever, and when her mother asked what was the matter, she told her tearfully all that had been arranged. Thereupon the cow said to her daughter, 'Wipe away your tears, and do not cry any more. When they slaughter me, you must take great care not to eat any of the meat, but after the repast, carefully collect my bones and inter them behind the house under a certain stone; then, should you ever be in need of help, come to my grave and there you will find it.' The cow was killed, and when the meat was served the poor girl declined to eat of it, pretending that she had no appetite; after the meal she gathered with great care all the bones and buried them on the spot indicated by her mother. Now, the name of the maiden was Marra, but, as she had to do the roughest work of the house, such as carrying water, washing, and sweeping, she was called by her stepmother and stepsister Pepelyouga (Cinderella). One Sunday, when the stepmother and her daughter had dressed themselves for church, the woman spread about the house the contents of a basktetful of millet, and said, 'Listen, Pepelyouga; if you do not gather up all this millet and have dinner ready by the time we return from church, I will kill you!' When they had gone, the poor girl began to weep, reflecting, 'As to the dinner I can easily prepare it, but how can I possibly gather up all this millet?' But that very moment she recalled the words of the cow, that, if she ever should be struck by misfortune, she need but walk to the grave behind the house, when she would find instant help there. Immediately she ran out, and, when she approached the grave, lo! a chest was lying on the grave wide open, and inside were beautiful dresses and everything necessary for a lady's toilet. Two doves were sitting on the lid of the chest, and as the girl drew near, they said to her, 'Marra, take from the chest the dress you like the best, clothe yourself, and go to church. As to the millet and other work, we ourselves will attend to that and see that everything is in good order!' Marra needed no second invitation; she took the first silk dress she touched, made her toilet, and went to church, where her entrance created quite a sensation. Everybody, men and women, greatly admired her beauty and her costly attire, but they were puzzled as to who she was, and where she came from. A prince happened to be in the church on that day, and he, too, admired the beautiful maiden. Just before the service ended, the girl stole from the church, went hurriedly home, took off her beautiful clothes and placed them back in the chest, which instantly shut and became invisible. She then rushed to the kitchen, where she discovered that the dinner was quite ready, and that the millet was gathered into the basket. Soon the stepmother came back with her daughter, and they were astounded to find the millet gathered up, dinner prepared, and everything else in order. A desire to learn the secret now began to torment the stepmother mightily. Next Sunday everything happened as before, except that the girl found in the chest a silver dress, and that the prince felt a greater admiration for her, so much so that he was unable, even for a moment to take his eyes from her. On the third Sunday, the mother and daughter again prepared to go to church, and, having scattered the millet as before, she repeated her previous threats. As soon as they disappeared, the girl ran straight to her mother's grave, where she found, as on the previous occasions, the open chest and the same two doves. This time she found a dress made of gold lace, and she hastily clad herself in it and went to church, where she was admired by all, even more than before. As for the czar's son, he had come with the intention not to let her this time out of his sight, but to follow and see where she went. Accordingly, as the service drew near to its close, and the maiden withdrew quietly as before, the enamored prince followed after her. Marra hurried along, for she had none too much time, and, as she went, one of her golden slippers came off, and she was too agitated to stop and pick it up. The prince, however, who had lost sight of the maiden, saw the slipper and put it in his pocket. Reaching home, Marra took off her golden dress, laid it in the chest, and rushed back to the house. The prince now resolved to go from house to house throughout his father's realm in search of the owner of the slipper, inviting all the fair maidens to try on the golden slipper. But, alas! his efforts seemed to be doomed to failure; for some girls the slipper was too long, for others too short, for others, again, too narrow. There was no one whom it would fit. Wandering from door to door, the sad prince at length came to the house of Marra's father. The stepmother was expecting him, and she had hidden her stepdaughter under a large trough in the courtyard. When the prince asked whether she had any daughters, the stepmother answered that she had but one, and she presented the girl to him. The prince requested the girl to try on the slipper, but, squeeze as she would, there was not room in it even for her toes! Thereupon the prince asked whether it was true that there were no other girls in the house, and the stepmother replied that indeed it was quite true. That very moment a cock flew onto the trough and crowed out lustily, 'Kook-oo-ryeh-koooo! Here she is under this very trough!' The stepmother, enraged, exclaimed, 'Sh! Go away! May an eagle seize you and fly off with you!' The curiosity of the prince was aroused. He approached the trough, lifted it up, and, to his great surprise, there was the maiden whom he had seen three times in church, clad in the very same golden dress she had last worn, and having only one golden slipper. When the prince recognized the maiden he was overcome with joy. Quickly he tried the slipper on her dainty foot. It not only fit her admirably, but it exactly matched the one she already wore on her left foot. He lifted her up tenderly and escorted her to his palace. Later he won her love, and they were happily married.", "title": "Pepelyouga", "id": 454}
{"label": "545B", "text": "A miller bequeathed to his three sons all he possessed of worldly goods, which consisted only of his mill, his ass, and his cat. It did not take long to divide the property, and neither notary nor attorney was called in; they would soon have eaten up the poor little patrimony. The eldest son had the mill; the second son, the ass; and the youngest had nothing but the cat.  The latter was very disconsolate at having such a poor share of the inheritance. 'My brothers,' said he, 'may be able to earn an honest livelihood by entering into partnership; but, as for me, when I have eaten my cat and made a muff of his skin, I must die of hunger.'  The cat, who had heard this speech, although he had not appeared to do so, said to him with a sedate and serious air, 'Do not be troubled, master; you have only to give me a bag, and get a pair of boots made for me in which I can go among the bushes, and you will see that you are not left so badly off as you believe.'  Though his master did not place much reliance on the cat's words, he had seen him play such cunning tricks in catching rats and mice, when he would hang himself up by the heels, or hide in the ?our pretending to be dead, that he was not altogether without hope of being helped by him out of his distress.  As soon as the cat had what he asked for, he boldly pulled on his boots, and, hanging his bag round his neck, he took the strings of it in his forepaws, and started off for a warren where there were a great number of rabbits. He put some bran and sow-thistles in his bag, and then, stretching himself out as if he were dead, he waited till some young rabbit, little versed in the wiles of the world, should come and poke his way into the bag, in order to eat what was inside it.  He had hardly laid himself down before he had the pleasure of seeing a young scatterbrain of a rabbit get into the bag, whereupon Master Cat pulled the strings, caught it, and killed it without mercy. Proud of his prey, he went to the palace, and asked to speak to the king.  He was ushered upstairs and into the state apartment, and, after making a low bow to the king, he said, 'Sire, here is a wild rabbit, which my Lord the Marquis of Carabas -- for such was the title he had taken a fancy to give to his master -- has ordered me to present, with his duty, to your majesty.'  'Tell your master,' replied the king, 'that I thank him and am pleased with his gift.'  Another day he went and hid himself in the wheat, keeping the mouth of his bag open as before, and as soon as he saw that a brace of partridges had run inside, he pulled the strings, and so took them both. He went immediately and presented them to the king, as he had the rabbits. The king was equally grateful at receiving the brace of partridges, and ordered drink to be given him.  For the next two or three months, the cat continued in this manner, taking presents of game at intervals to the king, as if from his master.  One day, when he knew the king was going to drive on the banks of the river, with his daughter, the most beautiful princess in the world, he said to his master, 'If you will follow my advice, your fortune is made; you have only to go and bathe in a part of the river I will point out to you, and then leave the rest to me.'  The Marquis of Carabas did as his cat advised him, without knowing what good would come of it.  While he was bathing, the king passed by, and the cat began to call out with all his might, 'Help! Help! My lord the Marquis of Carabas is drowning!'  Hearing the cry, the king looked out of the coach window, and recognizing the cat who had so often brought him game, he ordered his guards to ?y to the help of my lord the Marquis of Carabas. Whilst they were getting the poor marquis out of the river, the cat went up to the royal coach, and told the king that, while his master had been bathing, some robbers had come and carried off his clothes, although he had shouted, 'Stop thief,' as loud as he could. The rogue had hidden them himself under a large stone. The king immediately ordered the officers of his wardrobe to go and fetch one of his handsomest suits for my lord the Marquis of Carabas. The king embraced him a thousand times, and as the ?ne clothes they dressed him in set off his good looks -- for he was handsome and well made -- the Marquis of Carabas quite took the fancy of the king's daughter, and after he had cast two or three respectful and rather tender glances towards her, she fell very much in love with him. The king insisted upon his getting into the coach, and accompanying them in their drive.  The cat, delighted to see that his plans were beginning to succeed, ran on before, and coming across some peasants who were mowing a meadow, he said to them, 'You, good people, who are mowing here, if you do not tell the king that this meadow you are mowing belongs to my lord the Marquis of Carabas, you shall all be cut in pieces as small as minced meat.'  The king did not fail to ask the peasants whose meadow it was they were mowing.  'It belongs to my Lord the Marquis of Carabas,' said they all together, for the cat's threat had frightened them.  'You have a ?ne property there,' said the king to the Marquis of Carabas.  'As you say, sire,' responded the Marquis of Carabas, 'for it is a meadow which yields an abundant crop every year.'  Master Cat, who still kept in advance of the party, came up to some reapers, and said to them, 'You, good people, who are reaping, if you do not say that all this corn belongs to my lord the Marquis of Carabas, you shall all be cut into pieces as small as minced meat.'  The king, who passed by a minute afterwards, wished to know to whom belonged all the corn ?elds he saw.  'To my lord the Marquis of Carabas,' repeated the reapers, and the king again congratulated the Marquis on his property.  The cat, still continuing to run before the coach, uttered the same threat to everyone he met, and the king was astonished at the great wealth of my lord the Marquis of Carabas. Master Cat at length arrived at a ?ne castle, the owner of which was an ogre, the richest ogre ever known, for all the lands through which the king had driven belonged to the lord of this castle. The cat took care to ?nd out who the ogre was, and what he was able to do; then he asked to speak with him, saying that he did not like to pass so near his castle without doing himself the honor of paying his respects to him. The ogre received him as civilly as an ogre can, and made him sit down.  'I have been told,' said the cat, 'that you have the power of changing yourself into all kinds of animals; that you could, for instance, transform yourself into a lion or an elephant.'  ''Tis true,' said the ogre, abruptly, 'and to prove it to you, you shall see me become a lion.'  The cat was so frightened when he saw a lion in front of him, that he quickly scrambled up into the gutter, not without difficulty and danger, on account of his boots, which were worse than useless for walking on the tiles. Shortly afterwards, seeing that the ogre had resumed his natural form, the cat climbed down again, and admitted that he had been terribly frightened.  'I have also been assured,' said the cat, ' but I cannot believe it, that you have the power besides of taking the form of the smallest animal; for instance, that of a rat, or a mouse; I confess to you I hold this to be utterly impossible.'  'Impossible!' exclaimed the ogre, 'You shall see!' and he immediately changed himself into a mouse, and began running about the ?oor.  The cat no sooner caught sight of it, than he pounced upon it and ate it.  In the meanwhile, the king, seeing the ?ne castle of the ogre as he was driving past, thought he should like to go inside.  The cat, who heard the noise of the coach rolling over the draw-bridge, ran to meet it, and said to the king, 'Your majesty is welcome to the Castle of my Lord the Marquis of Carabas!'  'How, my Lord Marquis,' exclaimed the king, 'this castle belongs to you? Nothing could be ?ner than this courtyard, and all these buildings which surround it. Let us see the inside of it, if you please.'  The marquis handed out the young princess, and following the king, who led the way upstairs, they entered a grand hall, where they found prepared a magni?cent repast, which the ogre had ordered in expectation of some friends, who were to have visited him that very day, but who did not venture to enter when they heard the king was there.  The king, as greatly delighted with the excellent qualities of my Lord the Marquis of Carabas as his daughter, who was more than ever in love with him, seeing what great wealth he possessed, said to him, after having drunk ?ve or six bumpers, 'It depends entirely on yourself, my Lord Marquis, whether or not you become my son-in-law.'  The marquis, making several profound bows, accepted the honor the king offered him, and that same day was married to the princess. The cat became a great lord, and never again ran after mice, except for his amusement.          Be the advantage never so great         Of owning a superb estate,         From sire to son descended,         Young men oft find, on industry,         Combined with ingenuity,         They'd better have depended.         If the son of a miller so quickly could gain         The heart of a princess, it seems pretty plain,         With good looks and good manners, and some aid from dress,         The humblest need not quite despair of success.", "title": "The Master Cat; or, Puss in Boots", "id": 455}

{"label": "954", "text": "In a town in Persia there dwelt two brothers, one named Cassim, the other Ali Baba. Cassim was married to a rich wife and lived in plenty, while Ali Baba had to maintain his wife and children by cutting wood in a neighboring forest and selling it in the town. One day, when Ali Baba was in the forest, he saw a troop of men on horseback, coming toward him in a cloud of dust. He was afraid they were robbers, and climbed into a tree for safety. When they came up to him and dismounted, he counted forty of them. They unbridled their horses and tied them to trees. The finest man among them, whom Ali Baba took to be their captain, went a little way among some bushes, and said, 'Open, Sesame!' so plainly that Ali Baba heard him. A door opened in the rocks, and having made the troop go in, he followed them, and the door shut again of itself. They stayed some time inside, and Ali Baba, fearing they might come out and catch him, was forced to sit patiently in the tree. At last the door opened again, and the Forty Thieves came out. As the Captain went in last he came out first, and made them all pass by him; he then closed the door, saying, 'Shut, Sesame!' Every man bridled his horse and mounted, the Captain put himself at their head, and they returned as they came. Then Ali Baba climbed down and went to the door concealed among the bushes, and said, 'Open, Sesame!' and it flew open. Ali Baba, who expected a dull, dismal place, was greatly surprised to find it large and well lighted, hollowed by the hand of man in the form of a vault, which received the light from an opening in the ceiling. He saw rich bales of merchandise -- silk, stuff-brocades, all piled together, and gold and silver in heaps, and money in leather purses. He went in and the door shut behind him. He did not look at the silver, but brought out as many bags of gold as he thought his asses, which were browsing outside, could carry, loaded them with the bags, and hid it all with fagots. Using the words, 'Shut, Sesame!' he closed the door and went home. Then he drove his asses into the yard, shut the gates, carried the money-bags to his wife, and emptied them out before her. He bade her keep the secret, and he would go and bury the gold. 'Let me first measure it,' said his wife. 'I will go borrow a measure of someone, while you dig the hole.' So she ran to the wife of Cassim and borrowed a measure. Knowing Ali Baba's poverty, the sister was curious to find out what sort of grain his wife wished to measure, and artfully put some suet at the bottom of the measure. Ali Baba's wife went home and set the measure on the heap of gold, and filled it and emptied it often, to her great content. She then carried it back to her sister, without noticing that a piece of gold was sticking to it, which Cassim's wife perceived directly her back was turned. She grew very curious, and said to Cassim when he came home, 'Cassim, your brother is richer than you. He does not count his money, he measures it.' He begged her to explain this riddle, which she did by showing him the piece of money and telling him where she found it. Then Cassim grew so envious that he could not sleep, and went to his brother in the morning before sunrise. 'Ali Baba,' he said, showing him the gold piece, 'you pretend to be poor and yet you measure gold.' By this Ali Baba perceived that through his wife's folly Cassim and his wife knew their secret, so he confessed all and offered Cassim a share. 'That I expect,' said Cassim; 'but I must know where to find the treasure, otherwise I will discover all, and you will lose all.' Ali Baba, more out of kindness than fear, told him of the cave, and the very words to use. Cassim left Ali Baba, meaning to be beforehand with him and get the treasure for himself. He rose early next morning, and set out with ten mules loaded with great chests. He soon found the place, and the door in the rock. He said, 'Open, Sesame!' and the door opened and shut behind him. He could have feasted his eyes all day on the treasures, but he now hastened to gather together as much of it as possible; but when he was ready to go he could not remember what to say for thinking of his great riches. Instead of 'Sesame,' he said, 'Open, Barley!' and the door remained fast. He named several different sorts of grain, all but the right one, and the door still stuck fast. He was so frightened at the danger he was in that he had as much forgotten the word as if he had never heard it. About noon the robbers returned to their cave, and saw Cassim's mules roving about with great chests on their backs. This gave them the alarm; they drew their sabers, and went to the door, which opened on their Captain's saying, 'Open, Sesame!' Cassim, who had heard the trampling of their horses' feet, resolved to sell his life dearly, so when the door opened he leaped out and threw the Captain down. In vain, however, for the robbers with their sabers soon killed him. On entering the cave they saw all the bags laid ready, and could not imagine how anyone had got in without knowing their secret. They cut Cassim's body into four quarters, and nailed them up inside the cave, in order to frighten anyone who should venture in, and went away in search of more treasure. As night drew on Cassim's wife grew very uneasy, and ran to her brother-in-law, and told him where her husband had gone. Ali Baba did his best to comfort her, and set out to the forest in search of Cassim. The first thing he saw on entering the cave was his dead brother. Full of horror, he put the body on one of his asses, and bags of gold on the other two, and, covering all with some fagots, returned home. He drove the two asses laden with gold into his own yard, and led the other to Cassim's house. The door was opened by the slave Morgiana, whom he knew to be both brave and cunning. Unloading the ass, he said to her, 'This is the body of your master, who has been murdered, but whom we must bury as though he had died in his bed. I will speak with you again, but now tell your mistress I am come.' The wife of Cassim, on learning the fate of her husband, broke out into cries and tears, but Ali Baba offered to take her to live with him and his wife if she would promise to keep his counsel and leave everything to Morgiana; whereupon she agreed, and dried her eyes. Morgiana, meanwhile, sought an apothecary and asked him for some lozenges. 'My poor master,' she said, 'can neither eat nor speak, and no one knows what his distemper is.' She carried home the lozenges and returned next day weeping, and asked for an essence only given to those just about to die. Thus, in the evening, no one was surprised to hear the wretched shrieks and cries of Cassim's wife and Morgiana, telling everyone that Cassim was dead. The day after Morgiana went to an old cobbler near the gates of the town who opened his stall early, put a piece of gold in his hand, and bade him follow her with his needle and thread. Having bound his eyes with a handkerchief, she took him to the room where the body lay, pulled off the bandage, and bade him sew the quarters together, after which she covered his eyes again and led him home. Then they buried Cassim, and Morgiana his slave followed him to the grave, weeping and tearing her hair, while Cassim's wife stayed at home uttering lamentable cries. Next day she went to live with Ali Baba, who gave Cassim's shop to his eldest son. The Forty Thieves, on their return to the cave, were much astonished to find Cassim's body gone and some of their money-bags. 'We are certainly discovered,' said the Captain, 'and shall be undone if we cannot find out who it is that knows our secret. Two men must have known it; we have killed one, we must now find the other. To this end one of you who is bold and artful must go into the city dressed as a traveler, and discover whom we have killed, and whether men talk of the strange manner of his death. If the messenger fails he must lose his life, lest we be betrayed.' One of the thieves started up and offered to do this, and after the rest had highly commended him for his bravery he disguised himself, and happened to enter the town at daybreak, just by Baba Mustapha's stall. The thief bade him good-day, saying, 'Honest man, how can you possibly see to stitch at your age?' 'Old as I am,' replied the cobbler, 'I have very good eyes, and will you believe me when I tell you that I sewed a dead body together in a place where I had less light than I have now.' The robber was overjoyed at his good fortune, and, giving him a piece of gold, desired to be shown the house where he stitched up the dead body. At first Mustapha refused, saying that he had been blindfolded; but when the robber gave him another piece of gold he began to think he might remember the turnings if blindfolded as before. This means succeeded; the robber partly led him, and was partly guided by him, right in front of Cassim's house, the door of which the robber marked with a piece of chalk. Then, well pleased, he bade farewell to Baba Mustapha and returned to the forest. By and by Morgiana, going out, saw the mark the robber had made, quickly guessed that some mischief was brewing, and fetching a piece of chalk marked two or three doors on each side, without saying anything to her master or mistress. The thief, meantime, told his comrades of his discovery. The Captain thanked him, and bade him show him the house he had marked. But when they came to it they saw that five or six of the houses were chalked in the same manner. The guide was so confounded that he knew not what answer to make, and when they returned he was at once beheaded for having failed. Another robber was dispatched, and, having won over Baba Mustapha, marked the house in red chalk; but Morgiana being again too clever for them, the second messenger was put to death also. The Captain now resolved to go himself, but, wiser than the others, he did not mark the house, but looked at it so closely that he could not fail to remember it. He returned, and ordered his men to go into the neighboring villages and buy nineteen mules, and thirty-eight leather jars, all empty except one, which was full of oil. The Captain put one of his men, fully armed, into each, rubbing the outside of the jars with oil from the full vessel. Then the nineteen mules were loaded with thirty-seven robbers in jars, and the jar of oil, and reached the town by dusk. The Captain stopped his mules in front of Ali Baba's house, and said to Ali Baba, who was sitting outside for coolness, 'I have brought some oil from a distance to sell at tomorrow's market, but it is now so late that I know not where to pass the night, unless you will do me the favor to take me in.' Though Ali Baba had seen the Captain of the robbers in the forest, he did not recognize him in the disguise of an oil merchant. He bade him welcome, opened his gates for the mules to enter, and went to Morgiana to bid her prepare a bed and supper for his guest. He brought the stranger into his hall, and after they had supped went again to speak to Morgiana in the kitchen, while the Captain went into the yard under pretense of seeing after his mules, but really to tell his men what to do. Beginning at the first jar and ending at the last, he said to each man, 'As soon as I throw some stones from the window of the chamber where I lie, cut the jars open with your knives and come out, and I will be with you in a trice.' He returned to the house, and Morgiana led him to his chamber. She then told Abdallah, her fellow slave, to set on the pot to make some broth for her master, who had gone to bed. Meanwhile her lamp went out, and she had no more oil in the house. 'Do not be uneasy,' said Abdallah; 'go into the yard and take some out of one of those jars.' Morgiana thanked him for his advice, took the oil pot, and went into the yard. When she came to the first jar the robber inside said softly, 'Is it time?' Any other slave but Morgiana, on finding a man in the jar instead of the oil she wanted, would have screamed and made a noise; but she, knowing the danger her master was in, bethought herself of a plan, and answered quietly, 'Not yet, but presently.' She went to all the jars, giving the same answer, till she came to the jar of oil. She now saw that her master, thinking to entertain an oil merchant, had let thirty-eight robbers into his house. She filled her oil pot, went back to the kitchen, and, having lit her lamp, went again to the oil jar and filled a large kettle full of oil. When it boiled she went and poured enough oil into every jar to stifle and kill the robber inside. When this brave deed was done she went back to the kitchen, put out the fire and the lamp, and waited to see what would happen. In a quarter of an hour the Captain of the robbers awoke, got up, and opened the window. As all seemed quiet, he threw down some little pebbles which hit the jars. He listened, and as none of his men seemed to stir he grew uneasy, and went down into the yard. On going to the first jar and saying, 'Are you asleep?' he smelt the hot boiled oil, and knew at once that his plot to murder Ali Baba and his household had been discovered. He found all the gang was dead, and, missing the oil out of the last jar, became aware of the manner of their death. He then forced the lock of a door leading into a garden, and climbing over several walls made his escape. Morgiana heard and saw all this, and, rejoicing at her success, went to bed and fell asleep. At daybreak Ali Baba arose, and, seeing the oil jars still there, asked why the merchant had not gone with his mules. Morgiana bade him look in the first jar and see if there was any oil. Seeing a man, he started back in terror. 'Have no fear,' said Morgiana; 'the man cannot harm you; he is dead.' Ali Baba, when he had recovered somewhat from his astonishment, asked what had become of the merchant. 'Merchant!' said she, 'he is no more a merchant than I am!' and she told him the whole story, assuring him that it was a plot of the robbers of the forest, of whom only three were left, and that the white and red chalk marks had something to do with it. Ali Baba at once gave Morgiana her freedom, saying that he owed her his life. They then buried the bodies in Ali Baba's garden, while the mules were sold in the market by his slaves. The Captain returned to his lonely cave, which seemed frightful to him without his lost companions, and firmly resolved to avenge them by killing Ali Baba. He dressed himself carefully, and went into the town, where he took lodgings in an inn. In the course of a great many journeys to the forest he carried away many rich stuffs and much fine linen, and set up a shop opposite that of Ali Baba's son. He called himself Cogia Hassan, and as he was both civil and well dressed he soon made friends with Ali Baba's son, and through him with Ali Baba, whom he was continually asking to sup with him. Ali Baba, wishing to return his kindness, invited him into his house and received him smiling, thanking him for his kindness to his son. When the merchant was about to take his leave Ali Baba stopped him, saying, 'Where are you going, sir, in such haste? Will you not stay and sup with me?' The merchant refused, saying that he had a reason; and, on Ali Baba's asking him what that was, he replied, 'It is, sir, that I can eat no victuals that have any salt in them.' 'If that is all,' said Ali Baba, 'let me tell you that there shall be no salt in either the meat or the bread that we eat to-night.' He went to give this order to Morgiana, who was much surprised. 'Who is this man,' she said, 'who eats no salt with his meat?' 'He is an honest man, Morgiana,' returned her master; 'therefore do as I bid you.' But she could not withstand a desire to see this strange man, so she helped Abdallah to carry up the dishes, and saw in a moment that Cogia Hassan was the robber Captain, and carried a dagger under his garment. 'I am not surprised,' she said to herself, 'that this wicked man, who intends to kill my master, will eat no salt with him; but I will hinder his plans.' She sent up the supper by Abdallah, while she made ready for one of the boldest acts that could be thought on. When the dessert had been served, Cogia Hassan was left alone with Ali Baba and his son, whom he thought to make drunk and then to murder them. Morgiana, meanwhile, put on a headdress like a dancing-girl's, and clasped a girdle round her waist, from which hung a dagger with a silver hilt, and said to Abdallah, 'Take your tabor, and let us go and divert our master and his guest.' Abdallah took his tabor and played before Morgiana until they came to the door, where Abdallah stopped playing and Morgiana made a low courtesy. 'Come in, Morgiana,' said Ali Baba, 'and let Cogia Hassan see what you can do'; and, turning to Cogia Hassan, he said, 'She's my slave and my housekeeper.' Cogia Hassan was by no means pleased, for he feared that his chance of killing Ali Baba was gone for the present; but he pretended great eagerness to see Morgiana, and Abdallah began to play and Morgiana to dance. After she had performed several dances she drew her dagger and made passes with it, sometimes pointing it at her own breast, sometimes at her master's, as if it were part of the dance. Suddenly, out of breath, she snatched the tabor from Abdallah with her left hand, and, holding the dagger in her right hand, held out the tabor to her master. Ali Baba and his son put a piece of gold into it, and Cogia Hassan, seeing that she was coming to him, pulled out his purse to make her a present, but while he was putting his hand into it Morgiana plunged the dagger into his heart. 'Unhappy girl!' cried Ali Baba and his son, 'what have you done to ruin us?' 'It was to preserve you, master, not to ruin you,' answered Morgiana. 'See here,' opening the false merchant's garment and showing the dagger; 'see what an enemy you have entertained! Remember, he would eat no salt with you, and what more would you have? Look at him! he is both the false oil merchant and the Captain of the Forty Thieves.' Ali Baba was so grateful to Morgiana for thus saving his life that he offered her to his son in marriage, who readily consented, and a few days after the wedding was celebrated with greatest splendor. At the end of a year Ali Baba, hearing nothing of the two remaining robbers, judged they were dead, and set out to the cave. The door opened on his saying, 'Open Sesame!' He went in, and saw that nobody had been there since the Captain left it. He brought away as much gold as he could carry, and returned to town. He told his son the secret of the cave, which his son handed down in his turn, so the children and grandchildren of Ali Baba were rich to the end of their lives.", "title": "The Forty Thieves", "id": 457}

{"label": "1676", "text": "About half-a-century ago there lived, in a lane leading away from a little village near Garstang, a poor idiot named Gregory. He was at once the sport and the terror of the young folks. Uniformly kind to them, carefully convoying them to the spots where, in his lonely rambles, he had noticed birds' nests, or pressing upon them the wildflowers he had gathered in the neighboring woods and thickets, he received at their ungrateful hands all kinds of ill treatment, not always stopping short of personal violence. In this respect, however, the thoughtless children only followed the example set them by their elders, for seldom did poor Gregory pass along the row of cottages, dignified by the name of street, which constituted the village, without an unhandsome head being projected from the blacksmith's or cobbler's shop, or from a doorway, and a cruel taunt being sent after the idiot, who, in his ragged clothing, with his handful of harebells and primroses, and a wreath of green leaves round his battered, old hat, jogged along towards his mother's cottage, singing as he went, in a pathetic monotone, a snatch of an old Lancashire ballad. In accordance with that holy law which, under such circumstances, influences woman's heart, the mother loved this demented lad with passionate fondness, all the tenderness with which her nature had been endowed having been called forth by the needs of the afflicted child, whose only haven of refuge from the harshness of his surroundings and the cruelty of those who, had not they been as ignorant as the hogs they fed, would have pitied and protected him, was her breast. Lavishing all her affection upon the poor lad, she had no kindness to spare for those who tormented him; and abstaining from any of those melodramatic and vulgar curses with which a person of less education would have followed those who abused her child, she studiously held herself aloof from her neighbors, and avoided meeting them, except when she was compelled to purchase food or other articles for her little household. This conduct gave an excuse for much ill feeling, and as the woman had no need to toil for her daily bread, and as her cottage was the neatest in the district, there was much jealousy. One night, at a jovial gathering, it was arranged that a practical joke, of what was considered a very humorous kind, should be played upon the idiot. The boors selected one of their party, whose task it should be to attire himself in a white sheet, and to emerge into the lane when the poor lad should make his appearance. In accordance with this plan the pack of hobbledehoys watched the cottage night after night, in the hope of seeing the idiot leave the dwelling, and at length their patience was rewarded. They immediately hid themselves in the ditch, while the mock ghost concealed himself behind the trunk of a tree. The lad, not suspecting any evil, came along, humming, in his melancholy monotone, the usual fragment, and just before he reached the tree the sheeted figure slowly stepped forth to the accompaniment of the groanings and bellowings of his associates. They had expected to see the idiot flee in terror; but instead of so doing, he laughed loudly at the white figure, and then suddenly, as the expression of his face changed to one of intense interest, he shouted, 'Oh, oh! A black one! A black one!' Sure enough, a dark and terrible figure stood in the middle of the road. The mock ghost fled, with his companions at his heels, the real specter chasing them hotly, and the idiot bringing up the rear, shouting at the top of his voice, 'Run, black devil! Catch white devil!' They were not long in reaching the village, down the street of which they ran faster than they ever had run before. Several of them darted into the smithy, where the blacksmith was scattering the sparks right and left as he hammered away at the witch-resisting horseshoes, and others fled into the inn, where they startled the gathered company of idle gossips; but the mock ghost kept on wildly, looking neither to the left nor to the right. The idiot had kept close behind the phantom at the heels of the mock ghost, and when at the end of the village the specter vanished as suddenly as it had appeared, the lad ran a little faster and took its place. Of this, however, the white-sheeted young fellow was not aware, and, fearing every moment that the shadow would catch him in its awful embrace, he dashed down a by lane. Before he got very far, however, the idiot, who had gradually been lessening the distance between them, overtook and seized him by the neck. With a terrible cry the rustic fell headlong into the ditch, dragging Gregory with him as he fell. The latter was soon upon his feet, and dancing about the lane as he cried, 'Catch white devil! Catch white devil!' The mock ghost, however, lay quiet enough among the nettles. Roused by the story told by the affrighted ones who had rushed so unceremoniously into their presence, as well as by the startling cry of 'Run, black devil! Catch white devil!' which the idiot had shouted as he sped past the door, several of the topers emerged from their abiding place; and as nothing could be seen of either mock ghost, specter, or idiot, they bravely determined to go in search of them. As they passed along the road from the village, their attention was attracted by the cries which seemed to come from the lonely lane, and somewhat nervously making their way along it, they soon saw the idiot dancing about the side of the ditch. With a sudden access of courage, due to the presence of anything human, however weak, they hurried along, and as they drew nearer, the idiot paused in his gambols, and pointed to the mock ghost, who lay stretched in the shadow of the hedgerow. He was soon carried away to the village, where he lay ill for weeks. The kindness of Gregory's mother to the sick lad's parents, who were very poor and could ill afford to provide the necessary comforts his condition required, caused public feeling to turn in her favor, and those who formerly had been loudest in defaming her became her warmest eulogists. Between the idiot and the young fellow, too, a strange friendship sprang up, and the pair might often be seen passing along the lanes, the idiot chanting his melancholy fragments to the companion whose cap he had adorned with wreaths of wildflowers. With such a protector the idiot was quite safe, and, indeed, had the village children been wishful to torment Gregory, if the presence of this companion had not sufficed to restrain them, they had only to remember that it was in defense of poor Gregory the Evil One himself had raced through the village.", "title": "The Chivalrous Devil", "id": 459}
{"label": "700", "text": "In a little lodge at a beautiful spot on a lake shore, alone with his sister, lived a boy remarkable for the smallness of his stature. Many large rocks were scattered around their habitation, and it had a very wild and out-of-the-way look. The boy grew no larger as he advanced in years, and yet, small as he was, he had a big spirit of his own, and loved dearly to play the master in the lodge. One day in winter he told his sister to make him a ball to play with, as he meant to have some sport along the shore on the clear ice. When she handed him the ball, his sister cautioned him not to go too far. He laughed at her, and posted off in high glee, throwing his ball before him and running after it at full speed, and he went as fast as his ball. At last his ball flew to a great distance; he followed as fast as he could. After he had run forward for some time, he saw what seemed four dark spots upon the ice, straight before him. When he came up to the shore he was surprised to see four large, tall men, lying on the ice, spearing fish. They were four brothers, who looked exactly alike. As the little boy-man approached them, the nearest looked up, and in his turn he was surprised to see such a tiny being, and turning to his brothers, he said: 'Tia! look! see what a little fellow is here.' The three others thereupon looked up too, and seeing these four faces, as if they had been one, the little spirit or boy-man said to himself: 'Four in one! What a time they must have in choosing their hunting-shirts!' After they had all stared for a moment at the boy, they covered their heads, intent in searching for fish. The boy thought to himself: 'These four-faces fancy that I am to be put off without notice because I am so little, and they are so broad and long. They shall find out. I may find a way to teach them that I am not to be treated so lightly.' After they were covered up, the boy-man, looking sharply about, saw that among them they had caught one large trout, which was lying just by their side. Stealing along, he slyly seized it, and placing his fingers in the gills, and tossing his ball before him, he ran off at full speed. They heard the pattering of his little steps upon the ice, and when the four looked up all together, they saw their fine trout sliding away, as if of itself, at a great rate, the boy being so small that he could not be distinguished from the fish. 'See!' they cried out, 'our fish is running away on the dry land!' When they stood up they could just see, over the fish's head, that it was the boy-man who was carrying it off. The little spirit reached the lodge, and having left the trout at the door, he told his sister to go out and bring in the fish he had brought home. She exclaimed, 'Where could you have got it? I hope you have not stolen it.' 'Oh,' he replied, 'I found it on the ice. It was caught in our lake. Have we no right to a little lake of our own? I shall claim all the fish that come out of its waters.' 'How,' the sister asked again,' could you have got it there?' 'No matter,' said the boy; go and cook it.' It was as much as the girl could do to drag the great trout within doors. She cooked it, and its flavor was so delicious that she asked no more questions as to how he had come by it. The next morning the little spirit or boy-man set off as he had the day before. He made all sorts of sport with his ball as he frolicked along -- high over his head he would toss it, straight up into the air; then far before him, and again, in mere merriment of spirit, he would send it bounding back, as if he had plenty of speed and enough to spare in running back after it. And the ball leaped and bounded about, and glided through the air as if it were a live thing, and enjoyed the sport as much as the boy-man himself. When he came within hail of the four large men, who were fishing there every day, he cast his ball with such force that it rolled into the ice-hole about which they were busy. The boy, standing on the shore of the lake, called out: 'Four-in-One, pray hand me my ball. 'No, indeed,' they answered, setting up a grim laugh which curdled their four dark faces all at once, 'we shall not;' and with their fishing-spears they thrust the ball under the ice. 'Good!' said the boy-man, 'we shall see.' Saying which he rushed upon the four brothers and thrust them at one push into the water. His ball bounded back to the surface, and, picking it up, he ran off, tossing it before him in his own sportive way. Outstripping it in speed he soon reached home, and remained within till the next morning. The four brothers, rising up from the water at the same time, dripping and wroth, roared out in one voice a terrible threat of vengeance, which they promised to execute the next day. They knew the boy's speed, and that they could by no means overtake him. By times in the morning, the four brothers were stirring in their lodge, and getting ready to look after their revenge. Their old mother, who lived with them, begged them not to go. 'Better,' said she, 'now that your clothes are dry, to think no more of the ducking than to go and all four of you get your heads broken, as you surely will, for that boy is a monedo or he could not perform such feats as he does.' But her sons paid no heed to this wise advice, and, raising a great war-cry, which frightened the birds overhead nearly out of their feathers, they started for the boy's lodge among the rocks. The little spirit or boy-man heard them roaring forth their threats as they approached, but he did not appear to be disquieted in the least. His sister as yet had heard nothing; after a while she thought she could distinguish the noise of snow-shoes on the snow, at a distance, but rapidly advancing. She looked out, and seeing the four large men coming straight to their lodge she was in great fear, and running in, exclaimed: 'He is coming, four times as strong as ever!' for she supposed that the one man whom her brother had offended had become so angry as to make four of himself in order to wreak his vengeance. The boy-man said, 'Why do you mind them? Give me something to eat.' 'How can you think of eating at such a time?' she replied. 'Do as I request you, and be quick.' She then gave little spirit his dish, and he commenced eating Just then the brothers came to the door. 'See!' cried the sister, 'the man with four heads!' The brothers were about to lift the curtain at the door, when the boy-man turned his dish upside down, and immediately the door was closed with a stone; upon which the four brothers set to work and hammered with their clubs with great fury, until at length they succeeded in making a slight opening. One of the brothers presented his face at this little window, and rolled his eye about at the boy-man in a very threatening way. The little spirit, who, when he had closed the door, had returned to his meal, which he was quietly eating, took up his bow and arrow which lay by his side, and let fly the shaft, which, striking the man in the head, he fell back. The boy-man merely called out 'Number one' as he fell, and went on with his meal. In a moment a second face, just like the first, presented itself; and as he raised his bow, his sister said to him: 'What is the use? You have killed that man already.' Little spirit fired his arrow -- the man fell -- he called out 'Number two,' and continued his meal. The two others of the four brothers were dispatched in the same quiet way, and counted off as 'Number three' and 'Number four.' After they were all well disposed of in this way, the boy-man directed his sister to go out and see them. She presently ran back, saying: There are four of them.' 'Of course,' the boy-man answered, 'and there always shall be four of them.' Going out himself, the boy-man raised the brothers to their feet, and giving each a push, one with his face to the East, another to the West, a third to the South, and the last to the North, he sent them off to wander about the earth; and whenever you see four men just alike, they are the four brothers whom the little spirit or boy-man dispatched upon their travels. But this was not the last display of the boy-man's power. When spring came on, and the lake began to sparkle in the morning sun, the boy-man said to his sister: 'Make me a new set of arrows, and a bow.' Although he provided for their support, the little spirit never performed household or hard work of any kind, and his sister obeyed. When she had made the weapons, which, though they were very small, were beautifully wrought and of the best stuff the field and wood could furnish, she again cautioned him not to shoot into the lake. 'She thinks,' said the boy-man to himself, 'I can see no further into the water than she. My sister shall learn better.' Regardless of her warnings, he on purpose discharged a shaft into the lake, waded out into the water till he got into its depth, and paddled about for his arrow, so as to call the attention of his sister, and as if to show that he hardily braved her advice. She hurried to the shore, calling on him to return; but instead of heeding her, he cried out: 'You of the red fins, come and swallow me!' Although his sister did not clearly understand whom her brother was addressing, she too called out: 'Don't mind the foolish boy!' The boy-man's order seemed to be best attended to, for immediately a monstrous fish came and swallowed him. Before disappearing entirely, catching a glimpse of his sister standing in despair upon the shore, the boy-man hallooed out to her: 'Me-zush-ke-zin-ance!' She wondered what he meant. At last it occurred to her that it must be an old moccasin. She accordingly ran to the lodge, and bringing one, she tied it to a string attached to a tree, and cast it into the water. The great fish said to the boy-man under water: 'What is that floating?' To which the boy-man replied: 'Go, take hold of it, swallow it as fast as you can; it is a great delicacy.' The fish darted toward the old shoe and swallowed it, making of it a mere mouthful. The boy-man laughed in himself, but said nothing, till the fish was fairly caught, when he took hold of the line and began to pull himself in his fish-carriage ashore. The sister, who was watching all this time, opened wide her eyes as the huge fish came up and up upon the shore; and she opened them still more when the fish seemed to speak, and she heard from within a voice, saying, 'Make haste and release me from this nasty place.' It was her brother's voice, which she was accustomed to obey; and she made haste with her knife to open a door in the side of the fish, from which the boy-man presently leaped forth. He lost no time in ordering her to cut it up and dry it; telling her that their spring supply of meat was now provided. The sister now began to believe that her brother was an extraordinary boy; yet she was not altogether satisfied in her mind that he was greater than the rest of the world. They sat, one evening, in the lodge, musing with each other in the dark, by the light of each other's eyes -- for they had no other of any kind -- when the sister said, 'My brother, it is strange that you, who can do so much, are no wiser than the Ko-Ko, who gets all his light from the moon; which shines or not, as it pleases.' 'And is not that light enough?' asked the little spirit. 'Quite enough,' the sister replied. 'If it would but come within the lodge and not sojourn out in the tree-tops and among the clouds.' 'We will have a light of our own, sister,' said the boy-man; and, casting himself upon a mat by the door, he commenced singing: Fire-fly, fire-fly, bright little thing, Light me to bed and my song I will sing; Give me your light, as you fly o'er my head, That I may merrily go to my bed. Give me your light o'er the grass as you creep, That I may joyfully go to my sleep; Come, little fire-fly, come little beast, Come! and I'll make you tomorrow a feast. Come, little candle, that flies as I sing, Bright little fairy-bug, night's little king; Come and I'll dream as you guide me along; Come and I'll pay you, my bug, with a song. As the boy-man chanted this call, they came in at first one by one, then in couples, till at last, swarming in little armies, the fire-flies lit up the little lodge with a thousand sparkling lamps, just as the stars were lighting the mighty hollow of the sky without. The faces of the sister and brother shone upon each other, from their opposite sides of the lodge, with a kindly gleam of mutual trustfulness; and never more from that hour did a doubt of each other darken their little household.", "title": "The Little Spirit, or Boy-Man", "id": 460}
{"label": "954", "text": "Once upon a time there were two brothers. One was very rich and had four children, the other was very poor and had seven children. One day the poor man's wife went to the rich man and said to him, 'I am very wretched, for I have not enough bread for my children. I take a little meal and I mix it with a great deal of bran and so manage to make bread. It is well nigh a year since my children have had any relish with their meals; they get nothing but bread and water.' He answered her: 'And yet your children are so strong, while mine, with all their feeding and the comforts they enjoy, are always ailing!' The poor woman said, 'God has given us poverty and hunger, but thanks be to Heaven, our children are hale and hearty. Now, therefore, I have come to beg you, if you have any work, not to send for anyone but me, so may God send health to your children!' and as she spoke these words, the tears ran from her eyes like a river. Then he called his wife and said to her: 'Have we any work for her to come and do for us daily, so that she may not sit idle?' His wife answered him: 'Let her come twice a week and knead bread for us.' When she heard these words she was glad, for she thought at once, that when she kneaded that fine white bread they would give her some of it, and her poor children would eat and rejoice. So she rose to go away. And they said to her: 'Good-bye, and remember to come tomorrow morning.' Thus they bade her farewell without giving her a scrap of anything. As she set off home she said to herself, 'Would that I were rich, that I might open my cupboard, and bring forth a bit of cheese, or a piece of bread, or at least a little rice, or such like household store to gladden the hearts of the poor!' and lifting her hands to heaven she said: 'Why, oh my God, hast thou made me so poor?' And so she went weeping home where her children were waiting for her ever so eagerly, hoping she might bring them something. But alas, poor thing, she came with empty hands. The next day she went very early in the morning to the rich man's house to knead bread, and when she had kneaded it and ended her work, they bade her farewell and told her to be sure and come next time, without giving her so much as a cup of cold water. As soon as she came home the children said to her: ' Have you brought us anything, mother?' 'No!' she said. 'Maybe, when they have done baking they will send us a bit of bread.' But in vain she waited, and when evening came not a loaf nor a plate of anything to eat appeared. In two or three days they sent word for her to come and knead again, for they liked her kneading much. Then the poor woman arose and went again; and as she was kneading the thought came into her head, not to wash her hands till she got home, and then to wash them in a dish, and to give the wash to her children instead of plain water. So as soon as she had done kneading, she hurried away, and when she got home she said to her children, 'Wait till I give you a little milk-soup.' And washing her hands well of the dough, she filled a good dish, and gave each one a little to drink. And they liked it so much that they said, 'Mother, whenever you go to knead, mind you bring us some of that broth to drink.' A month passed while she went on at this work. And it seems that God blessed her children, for they grew fatter than ever. One day as the rich man was passing by the poor man's house, he put his head in at the door and said, 'How do you do here?' Then he turns and looks at all the children, and is amazed to see how fat they seem; and going out at the door in a rage, he went home to his wife and called her: 'Come here and tell me what you give to my sister-in-law who comes to knead for us.' Now she was frightened at the way he shouted at her and said, 'I never gave her anything yet, because I am so afraid of giving her too much and your scolding me.' Says he, 'You must have given her something, for her children are so fat they look as if they would burst.' Then she swore an oath and said, 'She takes nothing away with her but her unwashed hands and she washes them at home, and gives the wash to her children to drink.' When he heard that he said, 'Put a stop to that too.' So the next day when the woman went to knead, her mistress waited until she had finished, and when she had done, said to her, 'Wash your hands well and then go.' When the poor woman heard that her countenance fell, and she quailed with grief to think how she should go to her children, and they would beg the milk-soup of her. When she came to her house her children were gathered together awaiting her, and as soon as they saw her come in they all cried with one voice: 'What have you got, mother?' 'Nothing, children; I forgot myself and washed my hands!' All the children began to weep and to cry, 'How could you so forget us, as not to bring us that beautiful broth?' While they were thus weeping and wailing, the father entered the house and said, 'What ails the children that they cry?' Then she told him all that had happened, and he was sorely grieved, and made up his mind to kill himself, and so that his wife might not guess his purpose, he asked her for a bag to go to the hill and gather herbs. She gave it him, and he went away. And as he wandered about bewildered for a long while, he found himself at the top of a high crag, and there he made up his mind to fling himself down and die. Then he spied facing the crag a great castle, and he said to himself, 'Before I kill myself, I may as well go and see what that castle is like.' And drawing near he saw a tree, and he climbed up into it to see who lived in the castle. After a little while he looked, and behold, a number of dragons came out ! He counted them, and they were forty-nine. When the dragons were gone, they left the door open, for that was always their custom. So he climbed down from the tree and went into the castle and walked about it, and saw that it contained much treasure. Then he took his bag and filled it with as much as his back could carry, and went away at once, for he feared lest the dragons should catch him. When they came back they perceived that a thief had been and stolen some of their money, and from henceforth they determined that one of them should always stay behind in the castle. The poor man returned to the town two days later, and found his wife weeping and refusing to be comforted, for she feared that his affliction had led him to go and kill himself. But when she saw him come back she praised God because he came alive. Then said her husband to her, 'Wife, God has taken pity on our children and on you, who made bread so long at my brother's house, though they never gave you a morsel to feed our little ones. See, here we have enough to live for some time.' And opening his bag he showed her the coins. She was a pious woman, so she said, 'The first thing you must buy is some oil that we may light a lamp to our Lady, which we have not done for so long.' And her husband hearkened unto her and straightway went and bought oil, and when they had lighted the lamp they prayed with all their hearts and with tears in their eyes. The next day her husband arose, and the first thing he did was to buy a house; and he moved into it with his homely furniture and his poor children. On the first evening he said to his wife, 'From day to day we will buy what we want for the house, but nothing more, for we must bear in mind how you used to give milk-soup to the children to drink, to save them from dying of hunger.' 'Yes,' said she, 'I will never ask you for anything that we do not want.' Two months passed during which these people lived happily. They did nothing else but go to church and help the poor. One day, then, the wife of the rich man came to visit her poor kinswoman, for she had heard from many that she was now well off, and she herself had begun to suffer misfortune; all her sheep had died, her fields had brought forth no crops, the frost had bitten many of her trees, and she had met with many other mishaps. When the poor woman saw her without being in the least affronted to think how little she had helped her in her own misery, she welcomed her joyfully, and gave her the best seat, and put before her the best things she had to eat in the house; whereas the other, when she went, had only received her in the kitchen, and never asked her to sit down! After some time, she said, 'Sister, pray tell me, where has your husband found work, that my husband may try and find some too, for we have fallen into great distress.' And the poor woman answered her, 'My husband has not got any employment, but the day you made me wash my hands he went away -- ' and then she told her all that had happened. Then the rich woman asked her to take her husband and show him the dragons. 'Perhaps,' said she, 'we, too, may thus find succour.' And the poor one said to her, 'When my husband comes this evening I will tell him, and your husband can go tomorrow, with a bag, along with him.' When the poor man came home at nightfall, his wife told him what had passed, and he said to her, 'I will go and show him the place, but I will not go to gather more treasures for myself, for this which I have God blesses, and it grows from day to day.' Next morning the rich man came with his bag on his back, and said to him, 'Good morrow, brother, how do you do? Are you well?' Whereas at other times, if he saw his brother in the way he would turn his back upon him, or take another road, so as not to hear him say that he wanted any help. But when the poor man saw him he got up and kissed him, and said, 'Welcome, brother; I daresay it's ten years since I had the happiness of seeing you enter my house.' 'Yes,' said the rich one, 'but now I have fallen into distress, and know not what to do.' Says the poor man, 'Let us go; perhaps you will have good luck yet, and get as rich as ever.' So they set off for the hill. And when they got there he showed him the tree, and said to him, 'Go aloft and sit in the tree, and soon the dragons will come out. Count them. If there are forty-nine you can come down and enter the castle free from fear; but if, peradventure, they are but forty-eight, do not go in.' With these words he went away. In a little while the dragons came out, and he began to count them. But it seems he counted them wrong, and instead of saying forty-eight he said forty-nine. So he came down as fast as he could and went into the castle, and eagerly looked about to see where the treasure was, that he might fill his bag and be gone with all speed, and as he stood there he heard a voice saying, 'So you are the thief, and have come back to steal more!' And lo! out comes the dragon which had been watching in a room close by, and seizes him by the head and makes four quarters of him, and hangs them up at the four corners of the dwelling. When the dragons came home, he said to them, 'There's no need to keep watch any longer, for I have hung up the four quarters of the thief, and they will guard our castle for us!' And from that day forward they determined, none of them to stay at home, but all of them to go out, and so they began to do. When two days had passed away the wife of the rich man got restless, and went to the house of her brother-in-law to ask him what they had done with her husband. But the poor man told her what directions he had given him, and said, 'I don't know whether he has counted the dragons right, but I will go and see.' And off he went. When he came near to the castle, he got up into the tree, and when the dragons came out he counted them with great care, and they were forty-nine in all. Then he came down and went into the castle and looked right and left for his brother. And raising his eyes he looked aloft and beheld his brother hanging in four quarters, and he was sore amazed. Then he lost no time in taking him down, filling his bag with money and going away. When he got home he felt very weary and sad, and said to his wife, 'Send someone to my sister-in-law's to tell her to come and take charge of her husband.' And when she came she wept, and would not be comforted on beholding her husband cut into four quarters. Then she said to the poor man, 'You must find me a tailor to sew him together, for I cannot bury him like that in four pieces.' The poor man went out at once and got a tailor, who sewed him together. When they had buried and bewailed him, the poor man opened the bag and gave his sister-in-law half the money, and said to her, 'Go and get succour for yourself and your children, and if you are in want again, do not blush to come and ask me for what you need.' The widow went home with tears in her eyes. Let us leave them and return to the dragons. When they reached their castle and found the dead man was gone, they all cried aloud, 'So the thief has an accomplice!' The next day, therefore, they went into the town and sought for a tailor to make them forty-nine coats and forty-nine pairs of shoes. So they said to the tailor, 'Mind you sew them well so that the stitches don't come out and that they fit us nicely!' And they said it over and over again till the tailor got angry and said to them, 'Here's a fuss! Why yesterday I had to sew a dead man, who was in four bits, together, and they were quite satisfied with the job, though it was out of my line, and you with your coats are like to craze me!' Then they said to him, 'Pray do you know the man who brought you the dead man to sew?' Said he, 'Of course I do, he lives quite close, and if you like I will show you his house, so that you can go and ask him, whether the dead man was well sewed or not.' So he took a dragon with him, and after walking twenty good paces, he showed them the shop. Then they went away to a joiner's, and ordered forty-eight chests, just big enough for them to get into. When they were finished, the forty-eight dragons got inside, and the forty-ninth remained outside. And in the morning the dragon went to the poor man's place, and said to him, 'I have had forty-eight chests sent me and I want you to be so kind as to let me leave them here for the night.' 'Not for one night only,' he answered, 'but let them stay as long as you like, and until it suits you to take them away.' And he got porters to bring them in. Then the children of the poor man began to get upon the chests, and jump about, and play on them; and the dragons who were inside, from time to time, groaned and said, 'Ah, would it were dark that we might eat them all.' One of the children was playing hide-and-seek with the rest, and he heard these words and these groanings. So he ran to his father and said: 'Those chests are bewitched; they are talking.' Then the father thought a moment, and said, 'Forty-eight! and the one that brought them makes forty-nine.' And he went close up to the chests, and put his ear at the key-hole, and he, too, heard the groaning. So he said to himself, 'Now, monsters, I'll make sure of you, now that I have got you in my power.' So off he set at once, and went and bought forty-eight spits, and lighted his kitchen fire, and put them in, and made them red hot, and took them one by one, and thrust them into all the chests. Then he said to his servant, 'Look here, my man, they have played us a trick, and put a dragon in a chest, and if we had not killed it, it would have eaten us all up.' The servant was angry, and said to his master, 'Give it me, and let me go sink it by the sea shore?' And he took it on his back, and threw it on to the beach. While he was on his way back, his master made ready another one, and said, 'You did not throw it far enough out to sea, and it has come back.' And as often as he returned he did the same with all, and threw them into the sea. But when he got to the last one he grew tired of always coming back and finding one there again, so he walked right into the sea, and plunged it in deep, and when he got back to the shop he called out: 'Master, is it back again?' And his master answered, 'No, no, it has not come back. You must have thrown it in very deep.' 'Aye, master,' said he, 'I went right into the sea, and plunged it in, and left it.' In the morning the dragon came to see what had become of the chests, and the merchant cunningly told him that one chest was found open, 'and I don't know,' says he, 'what you had inside.' He was seized with fear, and went to look at the chests, which were in the back part of the shop. And he found the chest was indeed open, and he trembled. The merchant lost no time, but seized him and flung him into the chest, and made it fast forthwith, and straightway spitted him, and so they were all done for. And the man himself inherited the dragon's castle, and lived there as happy as a prince, and may we live happier still.", "title": "The Two Brothers and the Forty-Nine Dragons", "id": 461}

She arose, she saw a cranny, and she jumped out at the cranny; but they kept hold of one of the shoes. The king's son said, 'Whomsoever that shoe would fit, she it was that he would marry.' Many were trying the shoe on, and taking off their toes and heels to try if it would fit them; but there were none whom the shoe would fit. There was a little bird in the top of a tree, always saying as everyone was trying on the shoe, 'Beeg beeg ha nan doot a heeg ach don tjay veeg a ha fo laiv a hawchkare.' -- Wee wee, it comes not on thee; but on the wee one under the hand of the cook. When he could get none whom the shoe would fit, the king's son lay down, and his mother went to the kitchen to talk over the matter. 'Won't you let me see the shoe?' said she. 'I will not do it any harm at all events.' 'Thou! thou ugly dirty thing, that it should fit thee.' She went down, and she told this to her son. 'Is it not known,' said he, 'that it won't fit her at all events? And can't you give it her to please her?' As soon as the shoe went on the floor, the shoe jumped on her foot. 'What will you give me,' said she, ' to let you see the other one?' She reached the herd's house, and she put on the shoes, and the dress that would stand on the floor with gold and silver.

{"label": "706", "text": "[This tale, one of the few already mentioned by other authors on Greenland, has been translated from one of the oldest manuscripts.] An old married couple remained at home while their children travelled about all the summer. One day the wife was left alone as usual while the husband was out kayaking. On hearing something moving about close by, she hastened to hide beneath her coverlet, and after a little while, when she ventured to peep above it, she saw a little snow-bunting (Plectrophanes nivalis) hopping about on the floor and chirping, 'Another one will soon enter, who is going to tell thee something.' In a little while she was alarmed by a still greater noise ; and looking up again, she beheld a kusagtak (another little bird -- the wheat-ear -- Saxicola \u00c3\u00a6nanthe), likewise hopping on the floor and singing, 'Somebody shall soon enter and tell thee something.' It left the room, and was soon followed by a raven; but soon after it had gone she heard a sound like the steps of people, and this time she saw a very beautiful woman, who entered. On asking whence she came, the stranger told: In bygone days we often used to assemble in my home to divert ourselves at different plays and games, and in the evening, when it was all ended, the young girls generally remained out, and the young men used to pursue and court us; but we could never manage to recognise them in the dark. One night I was curious to know the one who had chosen me, and so I went and daubed my hands with soot before I joined the others. When our play had come to an end, I drew my hands along his back, and left him, and was the first who entered the house. The young people came in, one after another undressed, but for some time I observed no marks. Last of all my brother entered, and I saw at once that the back of his white jacket was all besmeared with soot. I took a knife, and sharpened it, and proceeded to cut off my two breasts, and gave him them, saying, 'Since my body seems to please thee, pray take these and eat them.' He now began to speak indecently to me, and courted me more than ever, and while we raced about the room he caught hold of some bad moss and lit it, but I took some that was good, and also lit mine. He ran out, and I ran after him; but suddenly I felt that we were lifted up, and soared high up in the air. When we got more aloft my brother's light was extinguished, but mine remained burning, and I had become a sun. Now I am on my way higher up the skies, that I may give warmth to the orphans (viz., going to make summer). Finally she said, 'Now close thy eyes.' The woman turned her eyes downwards; but perceiving that she was about to leave the house, she gave her one look, and observed that at her back she was a mere skeleton. Soon after she had left the house the old husband returned.

{"label": "402", "text": "'Ah me! Ah me! What availeth my marriage with all these women? Never a son has the Deity vouchsafed me. Must I die, and my name be altogether forgotten in the land?' Thus soliloquized one of the greatest monarchs that ever reigned in Kashmir, and then went to his zan\u00c3\u00a1na [the apartment where his wives lived], and threatened his numerous wives with banishment if they did not bear him a son within the next year. The women prayed most earnestly to the god Shiva to help them to fulfil the king's desire, and waited most anxiously for several months, hoping against hope, till at last they knew that it was all in vain, and that they must dissemble matters if they wished to remain in the royal household. Accordingly, on an appointed time, word was sent to the king that one of his wives was enciente, and a little while afterwards the news was spread abroad that a little princess was born. But this, as we have said, was not so. Nothing of the kind had happened. The truth was, that a cat had given birth to a lot of kittens, one of which had been appropriated by the king's wives. When his majesty heard the news he was exceedingly glad, and ordered the child to be brought to him -- a very natural request, which the king's wives had anticipated, and therefore were quite prepared with a reply. 'Go and tell the king,' said they to the messenger, 'that the Brahmans have declared that the child must not be seen by her father until she is married.' Thus the matter was hushed for a time. Constantly did the king inquire after his daughter, and received wonderful accounts of her beauty and cleverness; so that his joy was great. Of course he would like to have had a son, but since the Deity had not condescended to fulfil his desire, he comforted himself with the thought of marrying his daughter to some person worthy of her, and capable of ruling the country after him. Accordingly, at the proper time he commissioned his counselors to find a suitable match for his daughter. A clever, good, and handsome prince was soon found, and arrangements for the marriage were quickly concluded. What were the king's wives to do now? It was of no use for them to attempt to carry on their deceit any longer. The bridegroom would come and would wish to see his wife, and the king, too, would expect to see her. 'Better,' said they, 'that we send for this prince and reveal everything to him, and take our chance of the rest. Never mind the king. Some answer can be made to satisfy him for a while.' So they sent for the prince and told him everything, having previously made him swear that he would keep the secret, and not reveal it even to his father or mother. The marriage was celebrated in grand style, as became such great and wealthy kings, and the king was easily prevailed on to allow the palanquin containing the bride to leave the palace without looking at her. The cat only was in the palanquin, which reached the prince's country in safety. The prince took great care of the animal, which he kept locked up in his own private room, and would not allow anyone, not even his mother, to enter it. One day, however, while the prince was away, his mother thought that she would go and speak to her daughter-in-law from outside the door. 'O daughter-in-law,' she cried, 'I am very sorry that you are shut up in this room and not permitted to see anybody. It must be very dull for you. However, I am going out today; so you can leave the room without fear of seeing anyone. Will you come out?' The cat understood everything, and wept much, just like a human being. Oh those bitter tears! They pierced the mother's heart, so that she determined to speak very strictly to her son on the matter as soon as he should return. They also reached the ears of P\u00c3\u00a1rvat\u00c3\u00ad [the wife of Shiva], who at once went to her lord and entreated him to have mercy on the poor helpless cat. 'Tell her,' said Shiva, 'to rub some oil over her fur, and she will became a beautiful woman. She will find the oil in the room where she now is.' P\u00c3\u00a1rvat\u00c3\u00ad lost no time in disclosing this glad news to the cat, who quickly rubbed the oil over its body, and was changed into the most lovely woman that ever lived. But she left a little spot on one of her shoulders which remained covered with cat's fur, lest her husband should suspect some trickery and deny her. In the evening the prince returned and saw his beautiful wife, and was delighted. Then all anxiety as to what he should reply to his mother's earnest solicitations fled. She had only to see the happy, smiling, beautiful bride to know that her fears were altogether needless. In a few weeks the prince, accompanied by his wife, visited his father-in-law, who, of course, believed the princess to be his own daughter, and was glad beyond measure. His wives too rejoiced, because their prayer had been heard and their lives saved. In due time the king settled his country on the prince, who eventually ruled over both countries, his father's and his father-in-law's, and thus became the most illustrious and wealthy monarch in the world.", "title": "The Cat Who Became a Queen (Knowles)", "id": 473}

When the Turtle rose to the surface again, the boat was right abreast of him, and when the Turtle rose a second time, the boat people noticed that the Turtle was gaining on them. When finally, the last Turtle rose, the boat was only half way round. The Turtle won the race and got the reward.", "title": "Turtle's Race, Second Version", "id": 475}
{"label": "700", "text": "Once on a time there was a woman who had an only son, and he was no taller than your thumb; and so they called him Thumbikin. Now, when he had come to be old enough to know right and wrong, his mother told him to go out and woo him a bride, for now she said it was high time he thought about getting a wife. When Thumbikin heard that, he was very glad; so they got their driving gear in order and set off, and his mother put him into her bosom. Now they were going to a palace where there was such an awfully big princess, but when they had gone a bit of the way, Thumbikin was lost and gone. His mother hunted for him everywhere, and bawled to him, and wept because he was lost, and she couldn't find him again. 'Pip, Pip,' said Thumbikin, 'here I am;' and he had hidden himself in the horse's mane. So he came out, and had to give his word to his mother that he wouldn't do so any more. But when they had driven a bit farther on, Thumbikin was lost again. His mother hunted for him, and called him and wept; but gone he was, and gone he stayed. 'Pip, Pip,' said Thumbikin at last; and then she heard how he laughed and tittered, but she couldn't find him at all for the life of her. 'Pip, Pip, why, here I am now!' said Thumbikin, and came out of the horse's ear. So he had to give his word that he wouldn't hide himself again; but they had scarce driven a bit farther before he was gone again. He couldn't help it. As for his mother, she hunted, and wept, and called him by name; but gone he was, and gone he stayed; and the more she hunted, the less she could find him in any way. 'Pip, Pip, here I am then,' said Thumbikin. But she couldn't make out at all where he was, his voice sounded so dull and muffled. So she hunted, and he kept on saying, ' Pip, here I am,' and laughed and chuckled, that she couldn't find him; but all at once the horse snorted, and it snorted Thumbikin out, for he had crept up one of his nostrils. Then his mother took him and put him into a bag; she knew no other way, for she saw well enough he couldn't help hiding himself. So, when they came to the palace the match was soon made, for the princess thought him a pretty little chap, and it wasn't long before the wedding came on too. Now, when they were going to sit down to the wedding-feast, Thumbikin sat at the table by the princess's side; but he had worse than no seat, for when he was to eat he couldn't reacli up, to the table; and so, if the princess hadn't helped him up on to it, he wouldn't have got a bit to eat. Now it went good and well so long as he had to eat off a plate, but then there came a great bowl of porridge -- that he couldn't reach up to; but Thumbikn soon found out a way to help himself; he climbed up and sat on the lip of the bowl. But then there was a pat of melting butter right in the middle of the bowl, and that he couldn't reach to dip his porridge into it, and so he went on and took his seat at the edge of the melting butter; but just then who should come but the princess, with a great spoonful of porridge to dip it into the butter; and, alas! she went too near to Thumbikin, and tipped him over; and so he fell over head and ears, and was drowned in the melted butter.", "title": "Thumbikin", "id": 476}

The father took the child in his arms and went into the street to look for this just man. After he had walked along a while, he met a man, who was our Lord, and said to him, 'I have this child to baptize, but I do not want to give him to anyone who is not just. Are you just?' The Lord answered, 'But -- I don't know whether I am just.' Then the peasant passed on and met a woman, who was the Madonna, and said to her, 'I have this child to baptize and do not wish to give him to anyone who is not just. Are you just?' 'I don't know,' said the Madonna. 'But go on, for you will find someone who is just.' He went his way and met another woman, who was Death, and said to her, 'I have been sent to you, for I have been told that you are just, and I have this child to baptize, and do not wish to give it to one who is not just. Are you just?' Death said, 'Yes, I believe I am just! Let us baptize the child, and then I will show you whether I am just.' Then they baptized the child, and afterwards Death led the peasant into a very long room, where there were many lights burning. 'Godmother,' said the man, astonished at seeing all the light, 'what are all these lights?' Death said, 'These are the lights of all the souls in the world. Would you like to see, friend? This is yours and this is your son's' When the peasant saw that his light was about to expire, he said, 'And when the oil is all consumed, godmother?' 'Then,' answered Death, 'you must come with me, for I am Death.' 'Oh! for mercy's sake,' cried the peasant, 'let me at least take a little oil from my son's lamp and put it in mine!' 'No, no, godfather,' said Death. 'I don't do anything of that sort. You wished to see a just person, and a just person you have found.

{"label": "777", "text": "One of these who looked on was a shoemaker, Ahasuerus by name. He did not believe in Christ. He had been present when Pilate pronounced the sentence of death, and, knowing that Christ would be dragged past his house, he ran home and called his household to see this person, who, he said, had been deceiving the Jews. Ahasuerus stood in the doorway, holding his little child on his arm. Presently the crowd came by and Jesus in the midst, bearing his cross. The load was heavy, and Jesus stood a moment, as if he would rest in the doorway. But the Jew, willing to gain favor with the crowd, roughly bade him go forward. Jesus obeyed, but, as he moved away, he turned and looked on the shoemaker and said: 'I shall at last rest, but thou shalt go on till the last day.' Ahasuerus heard him. Stirred by some im pulse, he knew not what, he set his child down, and followed the crowd to the place of crucifixion. There he stayed till the end. And when the people turned back, he turned back with them, and went to his house, but not to stay. He bade his wife and children farewell. 'Go on!' a voice said to him, and on that day he began his wanderings. Years afterward he came back, but Jerusalem was a heap of ruins. The city had been destroyed, and he knew that his wife and children had long since been dead. 'Go on!' he heard, and he wandered forth, begging his way from house to house, from town to town, from one country to another. He wandered from Judaea to Greece, from Greece to Rome. He grew old, and his face was like leather, but his eyes were bright, and he never lost his vigor. He went through storms and the cold of winter, he endured the dry heat of summer, but no sickness overtook him. He joined armies that were going forth to battle, but death never came his way, though men fell by his side. He was never seen to laugh. Now and then, some learned man would draw him into talk, not knowing who he was, and would find him familiar with great events in history. It was not as if he had learned these in books. He talked as if he himself had been present. Then the learned man would shake his head, and say to himself, 'Poor man, he is mad,' and only after the old wanderer had left would the thought suddenly come, 'Why, that must have been the Wandering Jew.' Where is he now? No one knows. Wandering, weary, he moves from place to place. Sometimes he is driven off by the people, he looks so uncanny. When war breaks out, he says to himself, 'Perhaps now at last the end of the world is coming.' But though wars have lasted a hundred years, they cease at last, and still the Wandering Jew goes on, on.", "title": "The Wandering Jew (Scudder)", "id": 478}

His wife went to town and bought a nice large liver. After it was fried, and the husband still hadn't come home, it smelled so good that wanted some ever so much. Finally she sat down and tasted it herself. First she ate just a very little piece, thinking, 'He will never notice it.' But then she cut off another little piece, and soon the entire liver was gone. Then she became terribly frightened that her husband would scold her, so she ran to the gallows where someone was hanging whom they had hanged a short time ago. She cut out his liver and fried it. When Ahlemann came home he sat down, and it tasted marvelous. Afterward he went for beer with his children. Evening came, and it was already dark. The woman was lying in her bed when she heard something approaching her room. A voice called out, 'Where is Ah-lemann? Where is Ah-lemann?' She said, 'Ahlemann has gone for beer with all four!'

{"label": "2250", "text": "Messer Azzolino had a storyteller whom he made tell him tales during the long nights of winter. It happened that one night the storyteller had a great desire to sleep, while Azzolino urged him to tell tales. The storyteller began a tale of a countryman who had a hundred byzantines [ancient coins] of his own which he took with him to the market to buy sheep at the price of two per byzantine. Returning with his sheep he came to a river he had passed before much swollen with the rains which had recently fallen. Standing on the bank, he saw a poor fisherman with a boat, but of so small a size that there was only room for the countryman and one sheep at a time. Then the countryman began to cross over with one sheep, and he began to row. The river was wide. He rowed and passed over. And here the storyteller ceased his tale. Azzolino said, 'Go on!' And the storyteller replied, 'Let the sheep cross over, and then I will tell you the tale.' Since the sheep would not have crossed in a year, he could meanwhile sleep at his ease.

{"label": "130", "text": "Once upon a time, a long while ago, when beasts and fowls could talk, it happened that a dog lived in a farmer's barnyard. By and by he grew tired of watching the house all night and working hard all day, so he thought he'd go out into the world to seek his fortune. One fine day, when the farmer had gone away, he started off down the road. He hadn't gone far when he spied a cat curled up asleep on a door-stone in a farmer's yard, so he looked over the fence and called to the cat, 'I'm going out into the world to seek my fortune. Don't you want to come along too?' But the cat said she was very comfortable where she was, and didn't think she cared to go traveling. But the dog told her that by and by when she got old the farmer wouldn't let her lie on his sunny door-stone, but would make her lie in the cold, no matter whether it snowed or not. So the cat concluded she'd go along too, and they walked down the road arm in arm. They hadn't gone far when they spied a jackass eating grass in a farmer's yard. So the dog looked over the fence and called to the jackass, 'We're going out into the world to seek our fortune. Don't you want to come along too?' But the jackass said he was very comfortable where he was, and didn't think he cared to go traveling. But the dog told him that by and by, when he got old and stiff, he'd have to work early and late, year after year, for only just what he would eat, and short allowance at that. So the jackass concluded to go along too, and they all walked down the road arm in arm. They hadn't gone far when they spied a cock crowing in a farmer's yard, so the dog looked over the fence and called, 'We're going out into the world to seek our fortune. Don't you want to come along too?' But the rooster said he was very comfortable where he was, and didn't think he cared to go traveling. But the dog told him that by and by, when it came Thanksgiving, pop would go his head, and he'd make a fine dinner for the farmer. So the rooster concluded he'd go along too, and they all walked down the road arm in arm. Now they had neglected to take anything to eat along with them, and when night overtook them, weary, footsore, and hungry, they were in a dense forest, and they all began to blame the dog for getting them into such a scrape. The ass proposed that the cock should fly to the top of a high tree to see if he could discover a place for them to lodge. He had scarcely perched on a limb before he called to his friends that a house was a little way off, for he could see a light in the window. The dog called to him to come down and lead the was to the house, and they all walked off arm in arm to the house. When they got there it was perfectly still about the house. They could hear no one inside. The ass kicked at the door, but no one answered. They looked about and found the house had only one window, and that was so high up they couldn't look in. He proposed that the jackass should stand on his hind legs, with his forelegs resting against the house, while the dog should clamber up his back and stand on his head, the cat run up the backs of both, and the rooster fly to the cat's head, and then he could just look in at the window. 'Hurry and tell what you see,' said the jackass, 'for my neck is breaking off.' 'I see a fire on a hearth and a table loaded with all sorts of fine things to eat: turkey and plum pudding, and pan-dowdy, and a band of men sitting round the table.' 'Zounds!' said the dog, 'we must get in.' So the rooster flew against the window with such a crash that it scared the robbers -- for this was a band of robbers -- nearly to death. They jumped up from the table so quickly that they overturned their chairs and whisked out the candles, while in flew the rooster, the cat, and the dog at the window, while the jackass went round and waited at the door till the robbers came out and ran away. Then the beasts lighted the candles again, and picked up the chairs, and sat down and had a good supper. Then they began to look about to see how they should dispose of themselves for the night. The jackass went out in the barn to sleep in the hay, the dog lay on the rug by the hearth, the cat took up her bed among the warm ashes, and the rooster flew to the ridgepole of the house, and soon all were fast asleep, being very tired by their long day's journey. By and by the robbers plucked up courage, and about midnight came back to the house to see if perchance they had not been scared at their shadows. Two of them got in at the window to take a survey, and seeing the cat's glowing eyes in the ashes mistook them for coals, and scratching a match in them the cat sunk her claws in his hand, which terrified him so much that in attempting to escape he ran against the dog, and he in turn caught the robber by the leg and bit him. By this time the tumult had awakened the ass, and just as the robber rushed out at the door the jackass met him and kicked him ten feet in the air, while the rooster set up a hideous crowing. It took but a few minutes for the robbers to escape to the woods and find their companions, to whom they told a doleful tale, how in trying to light a match at the fireplace the devil with red-hot eyes stuck his claws into his hands, a second devil attacked him in the rear, while another devil kicked him into the air, and as he came down on the greensward, more dead than alive, another horrid demon form the housetop cried out, 'Throw the rascal up her, through the rascal up here.' The thieves could never be induced to go back to the house. They thought it haunted by devils. So our friends, the jackass, the dog, the cat, and the rooster, lived there happy forever after, preferring it to traveling about to see the world.", "title": "The Dog, the Cat, the Ass, and the Cock", "id": 481}
{"label": "502", "text": "Once upon a time there was a king who had a great forest near his castle, full of all kinds of wild animals. One day he sent out a huntsman to shoot a deer, but the huntsman did not come back again. 'Perhaps he has had an accident,' said the king, and the following day he sent out two other huntsmen who were to search for him, but they did not return either. Then on the third day, he summoned all his huntsmen, and said, 'Search through the whole forest, and do not give up until you have found all three.' But none of these came home again either, nor were any of the hounds from the pack that they had taken with them ever seen again. From that time on, no one dared to go into these woods, and they lay there in deep quiet and solitude, and all that one saw from there was an occasional eagle or hawk flying overhead. This lasted for many years, when an unknown huntsman presented himself to the king seeking a position, and he volunteered to go into the dangerous woods. The king, however, did not want to give his permission, and said, 'It is haunted in there. I am afraid that you will do no better than did the others, and that you will never come out again.' The huntsman answered, 'Sir, I will proceed at my own risk. I know nothing of fear.' The huntsman therefore set forth with his dog into the woods. It was not long before the dog picked up a scent and wanted to follow it, but the dog had run only a few steps when it came to a deep pool, and could go no further. Then a naked arm reached out of the water, seized the dog, and pulled it under. When the huntsman saw that, he went back and got three men. They returned with buckets and baled out the water. When they could see to the bottom, there was a wild man lying there. His body was brown like rusty iron, and his hair hung over his face down to his knees. They bound him with cords and led him away to the castle. Everyone was greatly astonished at the wild man. The king had him put into an iron cage in his courtyard, forbidding, on pain of death, that the cage door be opened. The queen herself was to safeguard the key. From this time forth everyone could once again go safely into the woods. The king had a son of eight years. One day he was playing in the courtyard, and during his game his golden ball fell into the cage. The boy ran to the cage and said, 'Give me my ball.' 'Not until you have opened the door for me,' answered the man. 'No,' said the boy, 'I will not do that. The king has forbidden it,' and he ran away. The next day he came again and demanded his ball. The wild man said, 'Open my door,' but the boy would not do so. On the third day the king had ridden out hunting, and the boy went once more and said, 'Even if I wanted to, I could not open the door. I do not have the key.' Then the wild man said, 'It is under your mother's pillow. You can get it there.' The boy, who wanted to have his ball back, threw all caution to the wind, and got the key. The door opened with difficulty, and the boy pinched his finger. When it was open, the wild man stepped out, gave him the golden ball, and hurried away. The boy became afraid. He cried out and called after him, 'Oh, wild man, do not go away, or I shall get a beating.' The wild man turned around, picked him up, set him on his shoulders, and ran into the woods. When the king came home he noticed the empty cage and asked the queen how it had happened. She knew nothing about it, and looked for the key, but it was gone. She called the boy, but no one answered. The king sent out people to look for him in the field, but they did not find him. Then he could easily guess what had happened, and great sorrow ruled at the royal court. After the wild man had once more reached the dark woods, he set the boy down from his shoulders, and said to him, 'You will never again see your father and mother, but I will keep you with me, for you have set me free, and I have compassion for you. If you do what I tell you, it will go well with you. I have enough treasures and gold, more than anyone in the world.' He made a bed of moss for the boy, upon which he fell asleep. The next morning the man took him to a spring and said, 'Look, this golden spring is as bright and clear as crystal. You shall sit beside it, and take care that nothing falls into it, otherwise it will be polluted. I shall come every evening to see if you have obeyed my order.' The boy sat down at the edge of the spring, and saw how sometimes a golden fish and sometimes a golden snake appeared from within, and took care that nothing fell into it. As he was thus sitting there, his finger hurt him so fiercely that he involuntarily put it into the water. He quickly pulled it out again, but saw that it was completely covered with gold. However hard he tried to wipe the gold off again, it was to no avail. That evening Iron Hans came back, looked at the boy, and said, 'What has happened to the spring?' 'Nothing, nothing,' he answered, holding his finger behind his back, so the man would not be able to see it. But the man said, 'You have dipped your finger into the water. This time I will let it go, but be careful that you do not again let anything else fall in.' Very early the next morning the boy was already sitting by the spring and keeping watch. His finger hurt him again, and he rubbed it across his head. Then unfortunately a hair fell down into the spring. He quickly pulled it out, but it was already completely covered with gold. Iron Hans came, and already knew what had happened. 'You have let a hair fall into the spring,' he said. 'I will overlook this once more, but if it happens a third time then the spring will be polluted, and you will no longer be able to stay with me.' On the third day the boy sat by the spring and did not move his finger, however much it hurt him. But time passed slowly for him, and he looked at the reflection of his face in the water. While doing this he bent down lower and lower, wanting to look straight into his eyes, when his long hair fell from his shoulders down into the water. He quickly straightened himself up, but all the hair on his head was already covered with gold, and glistened like the sun. You can imagine how frightened the poor boy was. He took his handkerchief and tied it around his head, so that the man would not be able to see his hair. When the man came, he already knew everything, and said, 'Untie the handkerchief.' The golden hair streamed forth, and no excuse that the boy could offer was of any use. 'You have failed the test, and you can stay here no longer. Go out into the world. There you will learn what poverty is. But because you are not bad at heart, and because I mean well by you, I will grant you one thing: If you are ever in need, go into the woods and cry out, 'Iron Hans,' and then I will come and help you. My power is great, greater than you think, and I have more than enough gold and silver.' Then the prince left the woods, and walked by beaten and unbeaten paths on and on until at last he reached a great city. There he looked for work, but he was not able to find any, because he had not learned a trade by which he could make a living. Finally he went to the castle and asked if they would take him in. The people at court did not at all know how they would be able to use him, but they took a liking to him, and told him to stay. Finally the cook took him into service, saying that he could carry wood and water, and rake up the ashes. Once when no one else was at hand, the cook ordered him to carry the food to the royal table. Because he did not want them to see his golden hair, he kept his cap on. Nothing like this had ever before happened to the king, and he said, 'When you approach the royal table you must take your hat off.' 'Oh, sir,' he answered, 'I cannot. I have an ugly scab on my head.' Then the king summoned the cook and scolded him, asking him how he could take such a boy into his service. The cook was to send him away at once. However, the cook had pity on him, and let him trade places with gardener's boy. Now the boy had to plant and water the garden, hoe and dig, and put up with the wind and bad weather. Once in summer when he was working alone in the garden, the day was so hot that he took his hat off so that the air would cool him. As the sun shone on his hair it glistened and sparkled. The rays fell into the princess's bedroom, and she jumped up to see what it was. She saw the boy and called out to him, 'Boy, bring me a bouquet of flowers.' He quickly put on his cap, picked some wildflowers, and tied them together. As he was climbing the steps with them, the gardener met him and said, 'How can you take the princess a bouquet of such common flowers? Quick! Go and get some other ones, and choose only the most beautiful and the rarest ones.' 'Oh, no,' replied the boy, the wild ones have a stronger scent, and she will like them better.' When he got into the room, the princess said, 'Take your cap off. It is not polite to keep it on in my presence.' He again responded, 'I cannot do that. I have a scabby head.' She, however, took hold of his cap and pulled it off. His golden hair rolled down onto his shoulders, and it was a magnificent sight. He wanted to run away, but she held him by his arm, and gave him a handful of ducats. He went away with them, but he did not care about the gold. He took the gold pieces to the gardener, saying, 'I am giving these things to your children for them to play with.' The next day the princess called to him again, asking him to bring her a bouquet of wildflowers. When he went in with it, she immediately grabbed at his cap, and wanted to take it away from him, but he held it firmly with both hands. She again gave him a handful of ducats. He did not want to keep them, giving them instead to the gardener for his children to play with. On the third day it was no different. She was not able to take his cap away from him, and he did not want her gold. Not long afterwards, the country was overrun by war. The king gathered together his people, not knowing whether or not fight back against the enemy, who was more powerful and had a large army. Then the gardener's boy said, 'I am grown up, and I want to go to war as well. Just give me a horse.' The others laughed and said, 'After we have left, then look for one by yourself. We will leave one behind for you in the stable.' After they had left, he went into the stable, and led the horse out. It had a lame foot, and it limped higgledy-hop, higgledy-hop. Nevertheless he mounted it, and rode away into the dark woods. When he came to the edge of the woods, he called 'Iron Hans' three times so loudly that it sounded through the trees. The wild man appeared immediately, and said, 'What do you need?' 'I need a strong steed, for I am going to war.' 'That you shall have, and even more than you are asking for.' Then the wild man went back into the woods, and before long a stable-boy came out of the woods leading a horse. It was snorting with its nostrils, and could hardly be restrained. Behind them followed a large army of warriors, outfitted with iron armor, and with their swords flashing in the sun. The youth left his three-legged horse with the stable-boy, mounted the other horse, and rode at the head of the army. When he approached the battlefield, a large number of the king's men had already fallen, and before long the others would have to retreat. Then the youth galloped up with his iron army and attacked the enemies like a storm, beating down all who opposed him. They tried to flee, but the youth was right behind them, and did not stop, until not a single man was left. However, instead of returning to the king, he led his army on a roundabout way back into the woods, and then called for Iron Hans. 'What do you need?' asked the wild man. 'Take back your steed and your army, and give me my three-legged horse again.' It all happened just as he had requested, and he rode home on his three-legged horse. When the king returned to his castle, his daughter went to meet him, and congratulated him for his victory. 'I am not the one who earned the victory,' he said, 'but a strange knight who came to my aid with his army.' The daughter wanted to hear who the strange knight was, but the king did not know, and said, 'He pursued the enemy, and I did not see him again.' She asked the gardener where his boy was, but he laughed and said, 'He has just come home on his three-legged horse. The others have been making fun of him and shouting, 'Here comes our higgledy-hop back again.' They also asked him, 'Under what hedge have you been lying asleep all this time?' But he said, 'I did better than anyone else. Without me it would have gone badly.' And then they laughed at him all the more.' The king said to his daughter, 'I will proclaim a great festival. It shall last for three days, and you shall throw a golden apple. Perhaps the unknown knight will come.' When the festival was announced, the youth went out into the woods and called Iron Hans. 'What do you need?' he asked. 'To catch the princess's golden apple.' 'It is as good as done,' said Iron Hans. 'And further, you shall have a suit of red armor and ride on a spirited chestnut horse.' When the day came, the youth galloped up, took his place among the knights, and was recognized by no one. The princess came forward and threw a golden apple to the knights. He was the only one who caught it, and as soon as he had it, he galloped away. On the second day Iron Hans had outfitted him as a white knight, and had given him a white horse. Again he was the only one who caught the apple. Without lingering an instant, he galloped away with it. The king grew angry and said, 'That is not allowed. He must appear before me and tell me his name.' He gave the order that if the knight who caught the apple, were to go away again, they should pursue him, and if he would not come back willingly, they were to strike and stab at him. On the third day, he received from Iron Hans a suit of black armor and a black horse, and he caught the apple again. But when he was galloping away with it, the king's men pursued him, and one of them got so close to him that he wounded the youth's leg with the point of his sword. In spite of this he escaped from them, but his horse jumped so violently that his helmet fell from his head, and they could see that he had golden hair. They rode back and reported everything to the king. The next day the princess asked the gardener about his boy. 'He is at work in the garden. The strange fellow has been at the festival too. He came home only yesterday evening. And furthermore, he showed my children three golden apples that he had won.' The king had him summoned, and he appeared, again with his cap on his head. But the princess went up to him and took it off. His golden hair fell down over his shoulders, and he was so handsome that everyone was amazed. 'Are you the knight who came to the festival every day, each time in a different color, and who caught the three golden apples?' asked the king. 'Yes,' he answered, 'and here are the apples,' taking them out of his pocket, and returning them to the king. 'If you need more proof, you can see the wound that your men gave me when they were chasing me. But I am also the knight who helped you to your victory over your enemies.' 'If you can perform deeds like these then you are not a gardener's boy. Tell me, who is your father?' 'My father is a powerful king, and I have as much gold as I might need.' 'I can see,' said the king, 'that I owe you thanks. Can I do anything for you?' 'Yes,' he answered. 'You can indeed. Give me your daughter for my wife.' The maiden laughed and said, 'He does not care much for ceremony, but I already had seen from his golden hair that he was not a gardener's boy,' and then she went and kissed him. His father and mother came to the wedding, and were filled with joy, for they had given up all hope of ever seeing their dear son again. While they sitting at the wedding feast, the music suddenly stopped, the doors opened, and a proud king came in with a great retinue. He walked up to the youth, embraced him, and said, 'I am Iron Hans. I had been transformed into a wild man by a magic spell, but you have broken the spell. All the treasures that I possess shall belong to you.'", "title": "Iron Hans", "id": 482}

When her husband learned the truth, he shot the stallion. The woman cried and would not go to bed. At daybreak she was gone, no one knew where. About a year after this it was discovered that she had gone off with some wild horses. One day when the people were traveling over a large open place they saw a band of horses, and the woman among them. She had partly changed into a horse. Her pubic hair had grown so long that it resembled a tail. She also had much hair on her body, and the hair of her head had grown to resemble a horse's mane. Her arms and legs had also changed considerably; but her face was still human, and bore some resemblance to her original self. The chief sent some young men to chase her. All the wild horses ran away, but she could not run so fast as they, and was run down and lassoed. She was brought into her husband's lodge; and the people watched her for some time, trying to tame her, but she continued to act and whinny like a horse. At last they let her free. The following year they saw her again. She had become almost entirely horse, and had a colt by her side.

One day, however, he fell very ill; and the king of the country bethought him that he would test the value of his remedy.

{"label": "425C", "text": "Once upon a time there was a king who had three daughters. The youngest was his pride and joy. One day he wanted to go to the fair to buy something, and he asked his three daughters what he should bring home for them. The first one asked for a golden spinning wheel. The second one a golden yarn reel, and the third one a clinking clanking lowesleaf. The king promised to bring these things and rode away. At the fair he bought the golden spinning wheel and the golden yarn reel, but no one had a clinking clanking lowesleaf for sale. He looked everywhere, but could not find one. This saddened him, because the youngest daughter was the joy of his life, and he wanted to please her ever so much. As he sorrowfully made his way homeward, he came to a great, great forest and to a large birch tree. Under the birch tree there lay a large black poodle dog. Because the king looked so sad, the dog asked him what was the matter. 'Oh,' answered the king, 'I was supposed to bring a clinking clanking lowesleaf to my youngest daughter, whom I love above anything else, but I cannot find one anywhere, and that is why I am so sad.' 'I can help you,' said the poodle. 'The clinking clanking lowesleaf grows in this tree. If a year and a day from now you will give me that which first greets you upon your arrival home today, then you can have it.' At first the king did not want to agree, but he thought about it long and hard, then said to himself, 'What could it be but our dog? Go ahead and make the promise.' And he made the promise. The poodle wagged his tail, climbed up into the birch, broke off the leaf with his frizzy-haired paw, and gave it to the king, saying, 'You had better keep your word, or you will wish that you had!' The king repeated his promise, took the leaf, and rode on joyfully. As he approached home, his youngest daughter jumped out with joy to greet him. The king was horrified. His heart was so filled with grief that he pushed her aside. She started to cry, thinking, 'What does this mean, that father is pushing me away?' and she went inside and complained to her mother. Soon the king came in. He gave the oldest girl the golden spinning wheel, the middle one the golden yarn reel, and the youngest one the clinking clanking lowesleaf, and he was quiet and sad. Then the queen asked him was wrong with him, and why he had pushed the youngest daughter away; but he said nothing. He grieved the entire year. He lamented and mourned and became thin and pale, so concerned was he. Whenever the queen asked him what was wrong, he only shook his head or walked away. Finally, when the year was nearly at its end, he could not longer keep still, and he told her about his misfortune, and thought that his wife would die of shock. She too was horrified, but she soon took hold of herself and said, 'You men don't think of anything! After all, don't we have the goose herder's daughter? Let's dress her up and give her to the poodle. A stupid poodle will never know the difference.' The day arrived, and they dressed up the goose girl in their youngest daughter's clothes until she looked just perfect. They had scarcely finished when they heard a bark outside, and a scratching sound at the gate. They looked out, and sure enough, it was the large black poodle dog. They wondered who had taught him to count. After all, a year has more than three hundred days, and even a human can lose count, to say nothing of a dog! But he had not lost count. He had come to take away the princess. The king and queen greeted him in a friendly manner, then led him outside to the goose girl. He wagged his tail and pawed at her, then he lay down on his belly and said, Sit upon my tail, And I'll take you away! She sat down on him, and he took off across the heath. Soon they came to a great, great forest. When they came to the large birch tree, the poodle stopped to rest a while, for it was a hot day, and it was cool and shady here. Around and about there were many daisies [called G\u00c3\u00a4nsebl\u00c3\u00bcmchen -- goose flowers -- in German] poking up their white heads from the beautiful grass, and the girl thought about her parents, and sighed, 'Oh, if only my father were here. He could graze the geese so nicely here in this beautiful, lush meadow.' The poodle stood up, shook himself, and said, 'Just what kind of a girl are you?' 'I am a goose girl, and my father tends geese,' she answered. She would have liked to say what the queen had told her to say, but it was impossible for anyone to tell a lie under this tree. She could not, and she could not. He jumped up abruptly, looked at her threateningly, and said, 'You are not the right one. I have no use for you:' They were not far from the king's house, when the queen saw them and realized which way the wind was blowing. Therefore she took the broom binder's daughter, dressed her up in even more beautiful clothes. When the poodle arrived and made nasty threats, she brought the broom girl out to him, saying, 'This is the right girl!' 'We shall see,' responded the poodle dog. The queen became very uneasy, and the king's throat tightened, but the poodle wagged his tail and scratched, then lay down on his belly, saying, The broom girl sat down on him, and he took off across the heath. Soon they too came to the great forest and to the large birch tree. As they sat there resting, the girl thought about her parents, and sighed, 'Oh, if only my father were here. He could make brooms so easily, for here there are masses of thin twigs!' She wanted to lie, for the queen had ordered her to, and she was a very strict mistress, but she could not, because she was under this tree, and she answered, 'I am a broom girl, and my father makes brooms.' He jumped up as though he were mad, looked at her threateningly, and said, 'You are not the right one. I have no use for you:' They approached the king's house, and the king and queen, who had been steadily looking out the window, began to moan and cry, especially the king, for the youngest daughter was the apple of his eye. The court officials cried and sobbed as well, and there was nothing but mourning everywhere. But it was to no avail. The poodle arrived and said, 'This time give me the right girl, or you will wish that you had!' He spoke with such a frightful voice and made such angry gestures, that everyone's heart stood still, and their skin shuddered. Then they led out the youngest daughter, dressed in white, and as pale as snow. It was as though the moon had just come out from behind dark clouds. The poodle knew that she was the right one, and said with a caressing voice, He ran much more gently this time, and did not stop in the great forest under the birch tree, but hurried deeper and deeper into the woods until they finally reached a small house, where he quietly lay the princess, who had fallen asleep, onto a soft bed. She slumbered on and dreamed about her parents, and about the strange ride, and she laughed and cried in her sleep. The poodle lay down in his hut and kept watch over the little house and the princess. When she awoke the next morning and found herself soul alone, she cried and grieved and wanted to run away, but she could not, because the house was enchanted. It let people enter, but no one could leave. There was plenty there to eat and drink, everything that even a princess could desire, but she did not want anything and did not take a single bite. She could neither see nor hear the poodle, but the birds sang wonderfully. There were deer grazing around and about, and they looked at the princess with their large eyes. The morning wind curled her golden locks and poured fresh color over her face. The princess sighed and said, 'Oh, if only someone were here, even if it were the most miserable, dirty beggar woman. I would kiss her and hug her and love her and honor her!' 'Is that true?' screeched a harsh voice close behind her, startling the princess. She looked around, and there stood a bleary-eyed woman as old as the hills. She glared at the princess and said, 'You called for a beggar woman, and a beggar woman is here! In the future do not despise beggar women. Now listen well! The poodle dog is an enchanted prince, this hut an enchanted castle, the forest an enchanted city, and all the animals enchanted people. If you are a genuine princess and are also kind to poor people, then you can redeem them all and become rich and happy. The poodle goes away every morning, because he has to, and every evening he returns home, because he wants to. At midnight he pulls off his rough hide and becomes an ordinary man. If he knocks on your bedroom door, do not let him in, however much he asks and begs, not the first night, not the second night, and especially not the third night. During the third night, after he has tired himself out talking and has fallen asleep, take the hide, make a large fire, and burn it. But first lock your bedroom door securely, so that he cannot get in, and do not open it when he scratches on the door, if you cherish your life. And on your wedding day say three times, don't forget it now, say three times: Old tongues, Old lungs! and I will see you again.' The princess took very careful notice of everything, and the old woman disappeared. The first night the prince asked and begged her to open her door, but she answered, 'No, I'll not do it,' and she did not do it. The second night he asked her even more sweetly, but she did not answer at all. She buried her head in her pillow, and she did not open the door. The third night he asked her so touchingly and sang such beautiful melodies to her, that she wanted to jump up and open the door for him, but fortunately she remembered the old woman and her mother and father. She pulled the bedcovers over her head, and did not open the door. Complaining, the prince walked away, but she did not hear him leave. While he slept she built up the fire, crept out on tiptoe, picked up the rough hide from the corner where the poodle always put it, barred the bedroom door, and threw it into the flames. The poodle jumped up howling, gnawed and clawed at the door, threatened, begged, growled, and howled again. But she did not open the door, and he could not open the door, however fiercely he threw himself against it. The fire flamed up brightly one last time, and there was an enormous bang, as if heaven and hell had exploded. Standing before her was the most handsome prince in the world. The hut was now a magnificent castle, the forest a great city full of palaces, and the animals were all kinds of people. At their wedding ceremony, the prince and the princess were seated at the table with the old king and the old queen and the two sisters and many rich and important people, when the bride called out three times, and the tattered old woman came in. The old queen scolded, and the two princesses scolded, and they wanted to chase her away, but the young queen stood up and let the old woman sit down at her place, eat from her plate, and drink from her goblet. When the old woman had eaten and drunk her fill, she looked at the old queen and the evil daughters, and they became crooked and lame. But she blessed the young queen, and she became seven times more beautiful, and no one ever saw or heard from the old woman again. klinkesklanken Lowesblatt,' M\u00c3\u00a4rchen und Sagen aus Hannover (Hannover: Verlag von Carl Ruempler, 1854), no. 20, pp. 64-69.", "title": "The Clinking Clanking Lowesleaf", "id": 485}
{"label": "502", "text": "On the outer wall of the Saint George Church at M\u00c3\u00bchlhausen one can still see numerous stone monuments that attest to the foundation of the city. Among these is one depicting an amazing legend. Ages ago there was a king in Th\u00c3\u00bcringen. One day while hunting, his hounds jumped around a tree in a thicket and could not be held back. He had one of his servants climb up the tree trunk, which was hollow, to see what was inside causing his pack to bark. A small wild man was inside, and the king's men fetched him out. The king was delighted with this wild man and had him sit next to himself in the coach. He forthwith called an end to the hunt. He named the captured wild man Noah and confined him in a crypt. The king himself waited on him and cared for him. One time when the king had to be away, his son George was playing ball in the castle, and the ball fell down through a hole in the crypt. The little prince called down: 'Wild man Noah, give me back my ball!' The wild man answered: 'I cannot give you your ball. If I were to throw it out, it would fly so far that you would never find it. Instead, go into your father's chamber, fetch the key, and open the door for me. Then I will give you your ball.' The prince fetched the key from his father's chamber, for without the key no one could open the crypt. He opened the crypt, and the wild man came out, gave him his ball, and said: 'In my need you have helped me, and if you are ever in need just go into the woods and call for me, and I will help you as well.' Soon afterward the king returned home, and his first step was to look after his wild man. How alarmed he was to discover that the crypt was empty, and he immediately suspected that it was his son who had freed the wild man. He summoned him and asked: 'George, did you take the key, open the crypt, and let the wild man Noah out?' The little prince honestly confessed to what he had done. The king at once disowned his prince, for his wild man was dearer to him than anything else. The prince sadly left his father's house and wandered aimlessly about in poverty until finally he came upon a shepherd. The shepherd suspected at once that the lad was not from a lower class and took him in. He taught him what he needed to know to help with the herd. George the sheepherder came to know a beautiful girl, and as he was now coming of age, he asked her to marry him. At that time a terrible beast called a lindorm had taken over the region. It demanded a human sacrifice every year. According to ancient belief, this beast was a magical curse. If it did not receive its sacrifice immediately it roared like a thunderstorm, threatening to destroy everything in the land. The time came when the people were called together to draw lots determining who would be the lindorm's next sacrifice. Sheepherder George's bride-to-be drew the losing lot. He remembered what the wild man had promised him. He stepped forward and asked that the sacrifice be delayed, for he intended to kill the lindorm. He quickly ran into the woods and called on the wild man Noah for help and support. The wild man appeared before him and gave him a white horse and a sword, then told him to put on a white robe, mount the white horse, point his sword foreward, and charge against the monster. The monster would hungrily open wide its jaws, and George could penetrate its throat with his sword. And so it happened. Thus George's bride, as well as the entire land, were freed from the monster. The people cheered with joy, happiness ruled throughout the land, and George was dubbed a knight. Everyone now wanted to know more about George's origins. He confessed that he was the king's son and related how he had become a sheepherder. He was told that his father had died, so he could return home safely and assume rule over the kingdom. Thus a king's son became a sheepherder, the sheepherder became a knight, and the knight became a king. Now that George had taken over the kingdom, he traveled throughout the land familiarizing himself with his realm and seeking adventure. He came to a small settlement surrounding a mill. The community had no church. The young king, wanting to give thanks to God, had a church built in this settlement. The church still carries his name, George, as its founder. The builder of the church carved the entire history into a stone monument. And that is how the city of M\u00c3\u00bchlhausen had its beginning.", "title": "The King's Wild Man", "id": 486}

{"label": "1645", "text": "There was once a man the name of Michael Hugh, and he was tormented with dreams of a kist was buried in under a bridge in England. For awhile he took no heed to the visions were with him in the stillness of the night, but at long last the notion grew in his mind that he be to visit that place and find out was there anything in it. 'I could make right use of a treasure,' thinks he to himself. 'For 'tis heart scalded I am with dwelling in poverty, and a great weariness is on me from toiling for a miserable wage.' Then he bethought of the foolishness of making the journey if all turned out a deceit. 'Sure I'll be rid of belief in the dreams are driving me daft with their grandeur and perseverance,' says he. 'Evenly failure will bring a sort of satisfaction for I'll get fooling whatever spirit does be bringing the vision upon me.' So my brave Michael Hugh took an ash plant in his hand, and away with him oversea to England to discover the bridge of the kist. He was a twelvemonth travelling and rambling with no success to rise his heart, and he began for to consider he had better return to his own place. But just as he was making ready to turn didn't he chance on a strong flowing river, and the sight near left his eyes when he found it was spanned by the bridge he was after dreaming of. Well Michael Hugh went over and he looked down on the black depth of water was flowing in under the arch. 'It'll be a hard thing surely to be digging for a kist in that place,' says he. 'I'm thinking a man would find a sore death and no treasure at all if he lepped into the flood. But maybe it's laid out for me to gather my fortune here, and some person may come for to give me instruction.' With that he walked up and down over the bridge, hoping for further advice since he could not contrive a wisdom for his use. There was a house convenient to the river, and after awhile a man came from it. 'Are you waiting on any person in this place?' says he to Michael Hugh. 'It's bitter weather to be abroad and you be to be as hardy as a wild duck to endure the cold blast on the bridge.' 'I'm hardy surely,' Michael Hugh makes his answer. 'But 'tis no easy matter to tell if I'm waiting on any person.' 'You're funning me,' says the Englishman. 'How would you be abroad without reason, and you having a beautiful wise countenance on you?' With that Michael Hugh told him the story of the dreams that brought him from Ireland, and how he was expectant of a sign to instruct him to come at the kist. The Englishman let a great laugh. 'You're a simple fellow,' says he. 'Let you give up heeding the like of visions and ghosts, for there is madness in the same and no pure reason at all. There's few has more nor better knowledge than myself of how they be striving to entice us from our work, but I'm a reasonable man and I never gave in to them yet.' 'Might I make so free as to ask,' says Michael Hugh, 'what sort of a vision are you after resisting?' 'I'll tell you and welcome,' says the Englishman. 'There isn't a night of my life but I hear a voice calling: 'Away with you to Ireland, and seek out a man the name of Michael Hugh. There is treasure buried in under a lone bush in his garden, and that is in Breffny of Connacht.'' The poor Irishman was near demented with joy at the words, for he understood he was brought all that journey to learn of gold was a stone's throw from his own little cabin door. But he was a conny sort of a person, and he never let on to the other that Michael Hugh was the name of him, nor that he came from Breffny of Connacht. The Englishman invited him into his house for to rest there that night, and he didn't spare his advice that dreams were a folly and sin. 'You have me convinced of the meaning of my visions,' says Michael Hugh. 'And what's more I'll go home as you bid me.' Next morning he started out, and he made great haste with the desire was on him to get digging the gold. When he came to his own place in Connacht he made straight for a loy and then for the lone bush. Not a long was he digging before he hoked out a precious crock full of treasure, and he carried it into the house. There was a piece of a flag stone lying on top of the gold, and there was a writing cut into it. What might be the meaning of that Michael Hugh had no notion, for the words were not Gaelic nor English at all. It happened one evening that a poor scholar came in for to make his cailee. 'Can you read me that inscription, mister?' asks Michael Hugh, bringing out the flag. 'Aye surely,' says the poor scholar. 'That is a Latin writing, and I am well learned in the same.' 'What meaning is in it?' asks the other. ''The same at the far side,'' says the scholar. 'And that is a droll saying surely when it gives no information beyond.' 'Maybe it will serve my turn, mister!' says Michael Hugh, in the best of humour. After the scholar was gone on his way, didn't himself take the loy and out to the garden. He began for to dig at the far side of the lone bush, and sure enough he found a second beautiful kist the dead spit of the first. It was great prosperity he enjoyed from that out. And he bought the grandest of raiment, the way the neighbours began for to call him Michael Hughie the Cock. Limerick I heard of a man from Mayo went to Limerick, and walked two or three times across the bridge there. And a cobbler that was sitting on the bridge took notice of him, and knew by the look of him and by the clothes he wore that he was from Mayo, and asked him what was he looking for. And he said he had a dream that under the bridge of Limerick he'd find treasure. 'Well,' says the cobbler, 'I had a dream myself about finding treasure, but in another sort of a place than this.' And he described the place where he dreamed it was, and where was that, but in the Mayo man's own garden. So he went home again, and sure enough, there he found a pot of gold with no end of riches in it. But I never heard that the cobbler found anything under the bridge at Limerick. 36-37.", "title": "The Bridge of the Kist", "id": 488}

On a certain day they started all together, taking with them four thousand rupees, wherewith to trade. Each of the little company had an equal share in this sum of money, and they set forth with light hearts, full of hope that they would prosper and become exceeding rich. On the way it came to pass that the great deity, according to his mighty power and wisdom, caused a full-grown golden tree to spring up suddenly, and to bring forth before their very eyes rich clusters of gold. Seeing this magnificent and valuable tree the four travelers became as men in a trance. They did not believe their own eyes. At length, however, seeing that it was so, and that there was no doubt about it, they changed their minds about traveling into a foreign country, and resolved to return back to their homes as soon as possible, taking with them the tree of gold. They reminded one another of their own Kashmiri proverb: If God intends to give, he will give at the door; but if he will not give, then what is the good of going a thousand kos (in search of money)? 'We cannot contest the will of God,' they said. 'Therefore, since we have happed upon this golden tree, let us appropriate it and be glad forever.' This was all very easy to decide, but how were they to arrange it? The tree was high and large and heavy. It must first be felled and cut up into bundles which they could carry. But how were they to perform all these without implements? Accordingly it was determined that two of the party should go to the nearest village and procure axes and saws and ropes, etc., while the other two remained behind to guard the treasure. Presently the two men appointed to go left for the tools. The remaining two meanwhile took counsel together as to how they could kill their partners. 'We will mix poison with their food,' said one, 'and then when they are disposed of we shall each have a double share of the gold.' And they did so. Now it happened that the other two who were walking to the village for the tools and other neccessaries had also covenanted together by the way to slay the two partners who were left behind. 'We will slay them with one stroke of the axe,' said one, 'and then we shall obtain twice the quantity of treasure.' In the course of a few hours they returned from the village with saws and axes, and at once, on arrival at the tree slew both of their partners. Each slew one with one stroke of his axe. They then commenced hewing down the tree; and this done, they soon cut up the branches; and then, thoroughly wearied with their great exertions, they sat down to rest and eat. Alas! They ate of the poisoned bread. In a little while a most overpowering sleep came upon both of them, a sleep from which they never awoke. A short time afterwards some other travelers passing by that way found the four corpses lying stretched out cold and stinking beneath the golden tree.", "title": "The Reward of Covetousness", "id": 490}

The boy tried to pull up the tree, but, after long trying, had to give it up, and go home again to the cave. Again some time passed, and he then begged again to be allowed to go into the world, and his father told him, as before, if he could pull up the beech tree he might go out into the world. This time the boy pulled up the tree, so the bear consented to let him go, first, however, making him cut away the branches from the beech, so that he might use the trunk for a club. The boy now started on his journey, carrying the trunk of the beech over his shoulder. One day as the bear's son was journeying, he came to a field where he found hundreds of plowmen working for their master. He asked them to give him something to eat, and they told him to wait a bit till their dinner was brought them, when he should have some -- for, they said, 'Where so many are dining one mouth more or less matters but little.' Whilst they were speaking there came carts, horses, mules, and asses, all carrying the dinner. But when the meats were spread out the bear's son declared he could eat all that up himself. The workmen wondered greatly at his words, not believing it possible that one man could consume as great a quantity of victuals as would satisfy several hundred men. This, however, the bear's son persisted in affirming he could do, and offered to bet with them that he would do this. He proposed that the stakes should be all the iron of their plowshares and other agricultural implements. To this they assented. No sooner had they made the wager than he fell upon the provisions, and in a short time consumed the whole. Not a fragment was left. Hereupon the laborers, in accordance with their wager, gave him all the iron which they possessed. When the bear's son had collected all the iron, he tore up a young birch tree, twisted it into a band and tied up the iron into a bundle, which he hung at the end of his staff, and throwing it across his shoulder, trudged off from the astonished and affrighted laborers. Going on a short distance, he arrived at a forge in which a smith was employed making a plowshare. This man he requested to make him a mace with the iron which he was carrying. This, the smith undertook to do; but putting aside half the iron, he made of the rest a small, coarsely finished mace. Bear's son saw at a glance that he had been cheated by the smith. Moreover, he was disgusted at the roughness of the workmanship. He however took it, and declared his intention of testing it. Then fastening it to the end of his club and throwing it into the air high above the clouds he stood still and allowed it to fall on his shoulder. It had no sooner struck him than the mace shivered into fragments, some of which fell on and destroyed the forge. Taking up his staff, bear's son reproached the smith for his dishonesty, and killed him on the spot. Having collected the whole of the iron, the bear's son went to another smithy, and desired the smith whom he found there to make him a mace, saying to him, 'Please play no tricks on me. I bring you these fragments of iron for you to use in making a mace. Beware that you do not attempt to cheat me as I was cheated before!' As the smith had heard what had happened to the other one, he collected his work-people, threw all the iron on his fire, and welded the whole together and made a large mace of perfect workmanship. When it was fastened on the head of his club the bear's son, to prove it, threw it up high, and caught it on his back. This time the mace did not break, but rebounded. Then the bear's son got up and said, 'This work is well done!' and, putting it on his shoulder, walked away. A little farther on he came to a field wherein a man was plowing with two oxen, and he went up to him and asked for something to eat. The man said, 'I expect every moment my daughter to come with my dinner, then we shall see what God has given us!' The bear's son told him how he had eaten up all the dinner prepared for many hundreds of plowmen, and asked, 'From a dinner prepared for one person how much can come to me or to you?' Meanwhile the girl brought the dinner. The moment she put it down, bear's son stretched out his hand to begin to eat, but the man stopped him. 'No!' said he, 'you must first say grace, as I do!' The bear's son, hungry as he was, obeyed, and, having said grace, they both began to eat. The bear's son, looking at the girl who brought the dinner (she was a tall, strong, beautiful girl), became very fond of her, and said to the father, 'Will you give me your daughter for a wife?' The man answered, 'I would give her to you very gladly but I have promised her already to the Moustached.' The bear's son exclaimed, 'What do I care for Moustachio? I have my mace for him!' But the man answered, 'Hush! hush! Moustachio is also somebody! You will see him here soon.' Shortly after a noise was heard afar off, and lo! behind a hill a moustache showed itself, and in it were three hundred and sixty-five bird's nests. Shortly after appeared the other moustache, and then came Moustachio himself. Having reached them, he lay down on the ground immediately, to rest. He put his head on the girl's knee and told her to scratch his head a little. The girl obeyed him, and the bear's son, getting up, struck him with his club over the head. Whereupon Moustachio, pointing to the place with his finger, said,' Something bit me here!' The bear's son struck with his mace on another spot, and Moustachio again pointed to the place, saying to the girl, 'Something has bitten me here!' When he was struck a third time, he said to the girl angrily, 'Look you! Something bites me here!' Then the girl said, 'Nothing has bitten you; a man struck you!' When Moustachio heard that he jumped up, but bear's son had thrown away his mace and ran away. Moustachio pursued him, and though the bear's son was lighter than he, and had gotten the start of him a considerable distance, he would not give up pursuing him. At length the bear's son, in the course of his flight, came to a wide river, and found, near it, some men threshing corn. 'Help me, my brothers, help -- for God's sake!' he cried; 'Help! Moustachio is pursuing me! What shall I do? How can I get across the river?' One of the men stretched out his shovel, saying, 'Here! Sit down on it, and I will throw you over the river!' The bear's son sat on the shovel, and the man threw him over the water to the other shore. Soon after Moustachio came up, and asked, 'Has any one passed here?' The threshers replied that a man had passed. Moustachio demanded, 'How did he cross the river?' They answered, 'He sprang over.' Then Moustachio went back a little to take a start, and with a hop he sprang to the other side, and continued to pursue the bear's son. Meanwhile this last, running hastily up a hill, got very tired. At the top of the hill he found a man sowing, and the sack with seeds was hanging on his neck. After every handful of seed sown in the ground, the man put a handful in his mouth and eat them. The bear's son shouted to him, 'Help, brother, help! -- for God's sake! Moustachio is following me, and will soon catch me! Hide me somewhere!' Then the man said, 'Indeed, it is no joke to have Moustachio pursuing you. But I have nowhere to hide you, unless in this sack among the seeds.' So he put him in the sack. When Moustachio came up to the sower he asked him it he had seen the bear's son anywhere? The man replied, 'Yes, he passed by long ago, and God knows where he has got before this!' Then Moustachio went back again. By-and-by the sower forgot that bear's son was in his sack, and he took him out with a handful of seeds, and put him in his mouth. Then bear's son was afraid of being swallowed, so he looked round the mouth quickly, and, seeing a hollow tooth, hid himself in it. When the sower returned home in the evening, he called to his sisters-in-law, 'Children, give me my toothpick! There is something in my broken tooth.' The sisters-in-law brought him two iron picks, and, standing one on each side, they poked about with the two picks in his tooth till the bear's son jumped out. Then the man remembered him, and said, 'What bad luck you have! I had very nearly swallowed you.' After they had taken supper they talked about many different things, till at last the bear's son asked what had happened to break that one tooth, whilst the others were all strong and healthy. Then the man told me in these words: Once on a time ten of us started with thirty horses to the sea-shore to buy some salt. We found a girl in a field watching sheep, and she asked us where we were going. We said we were going to the sea-shore to buy salt. She said, 'Why go so far? I have in the bag in my hand here some salt which remained over after feeding the sheep. I think it will be enough for you.' So we settled about the price, and then she took the salt from her bag, whilst we took the sacks from the thirty horses, and we weighed the salt and filled the sacks with it till all the thirty sacks were full. We then paid the girl, and returned home. It was a very fine autumn day; but as we were crossing a high mountain, the sky became very cloudy and it began to snow, and there was a cold north wind, so we could not see our path and wandered about here and there. At last, by good luck, one of us shouted, 'Here, brothers! Here is a dry place!' So we went in one after the other till we were all, with the thirty horses, under shelter. Then we took the sacks from the horses, made a good fire, and passed the night there as if it were a house. Next morning, just think what we saw! We were all in one man's head, which lay in the midst of some vineyards; and whilst we were yet wondering and loading our horses, the keeper of the vineyards came and picked the head up. He put it in a sling and slinging it about several times, threw it over his head, and cast it far away over the vines to frighten the starlings away from his grapes. So we rolled down a hill, and it was then that I broke my tooth.", "title": "The Bear's Son", "id": 491}
{"label": "592", "text": "Once on a time there was a cottager who had an only son, and this lad was weakly, and hadn't much health to speak of; so he couldn't go out to work in the field. His name was Freddy, and undersized he was, too; and so they called him Little Freddy. At home there was little either to bite or sup, and so his father went about the country trying to bind him over as a cowherd or an errand-boy; but there was no one who would take his son till he came to the sheriff, and he was ready to take him, for he had just packed off his errand-boy, and there was no one who would fill his place, for the story went that he was a skinflint. But the cottager thought it was better there than nowhere: he would get his food, for all the pay he was to get was his board -- there was nothing said about wages or clothes. So when the lad had served three years he wanted to leave, and then the sheriff gave him all his wages at one time. He was to have a penny a year. 'It couldn't well be less,' said the sheriff. And so he got threepence in all. As for Little Freddy, he thought it was a great sum, for he had never owned so much; but for all that he asked if he wasn't to have something more. 'You have already had more than you ought to have,' said the sheriff. 'Sha'n't I have anything, then, for clothes?' asked Little Freddy; 'for those I had on when I came here are worn to rags, and I have had no new ones.' And, to tell the truth, he was so ragged that the tatters hung and flapped about him. 'When you have got what we agreed on,' said the sheriff, 'and three whole pennies beside, I have nothing more to do with you. Be off!' But for all that be got leave just to go into the kitchen and get a little food to put in his scrip; and after that he set off on the road to buy himself more clothes. He was both merry and glad, for he had never seen a penny before; and every now and then he felt in his pockets as he went along to see if he had them all three. So when he had gone far, and farther than far, he got into a narrow dale, with high fells on all sides, so that he couldn't tell if there were any way to pass out; and he began to wonder what there could be on the other side of those fells, and how he ever should get over them. But up and up he had to go, and on he strode; he was not strong on his legs, and had to rest every now and then -- and then he counted and counted how many pennies he had got. So when he had got quite up to the very top, there was nothing but a great plain overgrown with moss. There he sat him down, and began to see if his money were all right; and before he was aware of him a beggar-man came up to him -- and he was so tall and big that the lad began to scream and screech when he got a good look of him, and saw his height and length. 'Don't you be afraid,' said the beggar-man, ''I'll do you no harm; I only beg for a penny, in God's name.' 'Heaven help me!' said the lad. 'I have only three pennies, and with them I was going to the town to buy clothes.' 'It is worse for me than for you,' said the beggar-man. 'I have got no penny, and I am still more ragged than you.' 'Well! then you shall have it,' said the lad. So when he had walked on awhile he got weary, and sat down to rest again. But when he looked up there he saw another beggar-man, and he was still taller and uglier than the first; and so when the lad saw how very tall and ugly and long he was he fell a-screeching. 'Now, don't you be afraid of me,' said the beggar; 'I'll not do you any harm. I only beg for a penny, in God's name.' 'Now, may heaven help me!' said the lad. 'I've only got two pence, and with them I was going to the town to buy clothes. If I had only met you sooner, then --' 'It's worse for mo than for you,' said the beggar-man. I have no penny, and a bigger body and less clothing.' 'Well, you may have it,' said the lad. So he went awhile farther, till he got weary, and then he sat down to rest; but he had scarce sat down than a third beggar-man came to him. He was so tall and ugly and long, that the lad had to look up and up, right up to the sky. And when he took him all in with his eyes, and saw how very, very tall and ugly and ragged he was he fell a-screeching and screaming again. 'Now, don't you be afraid of me, my lad,' said the beggar-man. 'I'll do you no harm; for I am only a beggar-man, who begs for a penny in God's name.' 'May heaven help me!' said the lad. 'I have only one penny left, and with it I was going to the town to buy clothes. If I had only met you sooner, then --' 'As for that,' said the beggar-man, 'I have no penny at all -- that I haven't, and a bigger body and less clothes, so it is worse for me than for you.' 'Yes!' said Little Freddy, he must have the penny then -- there was no help for it; for so each would have what belonged to him, and he would have nothing. 'Well!' said the beggarman, 'since you have such a good heart that you gave away all that you had in the world, I will give you a wish for each penny.' For you must know it was the same beggar-man who had got them all three; he had only changed his shape each time, that the lad might not know him again. 'I have always had such a longing to hear a fiddle go, and see folk so glad and merry that they couldn't help dancing,' said the lad; 'and so, if I may wish what I choose, I will wish myself such a fiddle, that everything that has life must dance to its tune.' 'That he might have,' said the beggarman; but it was a sorry wish. 'You must wish something better for the other two pennies.' 'I have always had such a love for hunting and shooting,' said Little Freddy; 'so if I may wish what I choose, I will wish myself such a gun that I shall hit everything I aim at, were it ever so far off.' 'That he might have,' said the beggarman; 'but it was a sorry wish. You must wish better for the last penny.' 'I have always had a longing to be in company with folk who were kind and good,' said Little Freddy; and so, if I could get what I wish, I would wish it to be so that no one can say 'Nay' to the first thing I ask.' 'That wish was not so sorry,' said the beggarman; and off he strode between the hills, and he saw him no more. And so the lad laid down to sleep, and the next day he came down from the fell with his fiddle and his gun. First he went to the storekeeper and asked for clothes, and at one farm he asked for a horse, and at another for a sledge; and at this place he asked for a fur coat, and no one said him 'Nay,' -- even the stingiest folk, they were all forced to give him what he asked for. At last he went through the country as a fine gentleman, and had his horse and his sledge; and so when he had gone a bit he met the sheriff with whom he had served. 'Good-day, master,' said Little Freddy, as he pulled up and took off his hat. 'Good-day,' said the sheriff. And then he went on, 'When was I ever your master?' 'Oh, yes!' said Little Freddy. 'Don't you remember how I served you three years for three pence?' 'Heaven help us!' said the sheriff. 'How you have got on all of a hurry! And pray how was it that you got to be such a fine gentleman?' 'Oh, that's tellings!' said Little Freddy. 'And are you full of fun, that you carry a fiddle about with you?' asked the sheriff.' 'Yes! Yes!' said Freddy. 'I have always had such a longing to get folk to dance; but the funniest thing of all is this gun, for it brings down almost anything that I aim at, however far it may be off. Do you see that magpie yonder, sitting in the spruce fir? What'll you bet I don't bag it, as we stand here?' On that the sheriff was ready to stake horse and groom, and a hundred dollars beside, that he couldn't do it; but, as it was, he would bet all the money he had about him; and he would go to fetch it when it fell -- for he never thought it possible for any gun to carry so far. But as the gun went off down fell the magpie, and into a great bramble thicket; and away went the sheriff up into the brambles after it, and he picked it up and showed it to the lad. But in a trice Little Freddy began to scrape his fiddle, and the sheriff began to dance, and the thorns to tear him; but still the lad played on, and the sheriff danced, and cried, and begged till his clothes flew to tatters, and he scarce had a thread to his back. 'Yes!' said Little Freddy; 'now I think you're about as ragged as I was when I left your service. So now you may get off with what you have got.' But, first of all, the sheriff had to pay him what he had wagered that he could not hit the magpie. So when the lad came to the town he turned aside into an inn, and he began to play, and all who came danced, and he lived merrily and well. He had no care, for no one could say him 'Nay' to anything he asked. But just as they were all in the midst of their fun up came the watchmen to drag the lad off to the town-hall: for the sheriff had laid a charge against him, and said he had waylaid him and robbed him, and nearly taken his life. And now he was to be hanged -- they would not hear of anything else. But Little Freddy had a cure for all trouble, and that was his fiddle. He began to play on it, and the watchmen fell a-dancing, till they lay down and gasped for breath. So they sent soldiers and the guard on their way; but it was no better with them than with the watchmen. As soon as ever Little Freddy scraped his fiddle, they were all bound to dance, so long as he could lift a finger to play a tune; but they were half dead long before he was tired. At last they stole a march on him, and took him while he lay asleep by night; and when they had caught him he was doomed to be hanged on the spot, and away they hurried him to the gallows-tree. There a great crowd of people flocked together to see this wonder, and the sheriff, he, too, was there; and he was so glad at last at getting amends for the money and the skin he had lost, and that he might see him hanged with his own eyes. But they did not get him to the gallows very fast, for Little Freddy was always weak on his legs, and now he made himself weaker still. His fiddle and his gun he had with him also -- it was hard to part him from them; and so, when he came to the gallows, and had to mount the steps, he halted on each step; and when he got to the top he sat down, and asked if they could deny him a wish, and if he might have leave to do one thing? He had such a longing, he said to scrape a tune and play a bar on his fiddle before they hanged him. 'No! No!' they said. 'It were sin and shame to deny him that.' For, you know, no one could gainsay what he asked. But the sheriff he begged them, for God's sake, not to let him have leave to touch a string, else it was all over with them altogether; and if the lad got leave, he begged them to bind him to the birch that stood there. So Little Freddy was not slow in getting his fiddle to speak, and all that were there fell a-dancing at once -- those who went on two legs, and those who went on four; both the dean and the parson, and the lawyer, and the bailiff, and the sheriff; masters and men, dogs and swine, they all danced and laughed and screeched at one another. Some danced till they lay for dead; some danced till they fell into a swoon. It went badly with all of them, but worst of all with the sheriff, for there he stood bound to the birch, and he danced and scraped great bits off his back against the trunk. There was not one of them who thought of doing anything to Little Freddy, and away he went with his fiddle and his gun, just as he chose; and he lived merrily and happily all his days, for there was no one who could say him 'Nay' to the first thing he asked for.'", "title": "Little Freddy and His Fiddle", "id": 492}
{"label": "113A", "text": "One winter's evening the sexton's wife was sitting by the fireside with her big black cat, Old Tom, on the other side, both half asleep and waiting for the master to come home. They waited and they waited, but still he didn't come, till at last he came rushing in, calling out, 'Who's Tommy Tildrum?' in such a wild way that both his wife and his cat stared at him to know what was the matter. 'Why, what's the matter?' said his wife. 'And why do you want to know who Tommy Tildrum is?' 'Oh, I've had such an adventure. I was digging away at old Mr. Fordyce's grave when I suppose I must have dropped asleep, and only woke up by hearing a cat's meow.' 'Meow!' said Old Tom in answer. 'Yes, just like that! So I looked over the edge of the grave, and what do you think I saw?' 'Now, how can I tell?' said the sexton's wife. 'Why, nine black cats all like our friend Tom here, all with a white spot on their chestesses. And what do you think they were carrying? Why, a small coffin covered with a black velvet pall, and on the pall was a small coronet all of gold, and at every third step they took they cried all together, 'Meow --'' 'Meow!' said Old Tom again. 'Yes, just like that!' said the sexton. 'And as they came nearer and nearer to me I could see them more distinctly, because their eyes shone out with a sort of green light. Well, they all came towards me, eight of them carrying the coffin and the biggest cat of all walking in front for all the world like -- but look at our Tom, how he's looking at me. You'd think he knew all I was saying.' 'Go on, go on,' said his wife. 'Never mind Old Tom.' 'Well, as I was a-saying, they came towards me slowly and solemnly, and at every third step crying all together, 'Meow --'' 'Meow!' said Old Tom again. 'Yes, just like that, till they came and stood right opposite Mr. Fordyce's grave, where I was, when they all stood still and looked straight at me. I did feel queer, that I did! But look at Old Tom. He's looking at me just like they did.' 'Go on, go on,' said his wife. 'Never mind Old Tom.' 'Where was I? Oh, they all stood still looking at me, when the one that wasn't carrying the coffin came forward and, staring straight at me, said to me -- yes, I tell 'ee, said to me -- with a squeaky voice, 'Tell Tom Tildrum that Tim Toldrum's dead,' and that's why I asked you if you knew who Tom Tildrum was, for how can I tell Tom Tildrum Tim Toldrum's dead if I don't know who Tom Tildrum is?' 'Look at Old Tom! Look at Old Tom!' screamed his wife. And well he might look, for Tom was swelling, and Tom was staring, and at last Tom shrieked out, 'What -- old Tim dead! Then I'm the King o' the Cats!' and rushed up the chimney and was never more seen.", "title": "The King o' the Cats", "id": 493}
{"label": "1641", "text": "Once upon a time three jars full of money were stolen from a raja's palace. As all search was fruitless the raja at last gave notice that whoever could find them should receive one half of the money. The offer brought all the jans [witch-finders] and ojhas in the country to try their hand, but not one of them could find the treasure. The fact was that the money had been stolen by two of the raja's own servants, and it fell to the duty of these same two men to entertain the ojhas who came to try and find the money. Thus they were able to keep watch and see whether any of them got on the right track. Not far from the raja's city lived a certain tricky fellow. From his boyhood he had always been up to strange pranks, and he had married the daughter of a rich village headman. At the time that the raja's money was stolen his wife was on a visit to her father, and after she had been some time away, he went to fetch her home. However, on his way, he stopped to have a flirtation with a girl he knew in the village, and the result was that he did not get to his father-in-law's house till long after dark. As he stood outside he heard his wife's relations talking inside, and from their conversation he learned that they had killed a capon for supper, and that there was enough for each of them to have three slices of capon and five pieces of the vegetable which was cooked with it. Having learned this he opened the door and went in. The household was amazed at his arriving so late at night, but he explained that he had dreamed that they had killed a capon and were having a feast, and that there was enough for them each to have three slices of capon and five pieces of vegetable, so he had come to have a share. At this his father-in-law could do nothing but have another fowl killed and give him supper. He was naturally astonished at the trickster's powers of dreaming and insisted that he must certainly go and try his luck at finding the raja's stolen money. The trickster was taken aback at this, but there was no getting out of it. So the next morning he set out with his father-in-law to the raja's palace. When they arrived they were placed in charge of the two guilty servants, who offered them refreshments of curds and parched rice. As he was washing his hands after eating, the trickster ejaculated, 'Find or fail, I have at any rate had a square meal.' Now the two servants were named Find and Fail, and when they heard what the trickster said, they thought he was speaking of them, and had by some magic already found out that they were the thieves. This threw them into consternation, and they took the trickster aside and begged him not to tell the raja that they were the thieves. He asked where they had put the money, and they told him that they had hidden it in the sand by the river. Then he promised not to reveal their guilt, if they would show him where to find the money when the time came. They gladly promised and took him the raja. The trickster pretended to read an incantation over some mustard see, and then taking a bamboo went along tapping the ground with it. He refused to have a crowd with him ,because they would spoil the spell, but Find and Fail followed behind him and showed him where to go. So he soon found the jars of money and took them to the raja, who according to his promise gave him half their contents.", "title": "The Stolen Treasure", "id": 494}
{"label": "124", "text": "'There's a Mr. Fox,' said she, 'that I know, Who lives in a covert hard by, To our race he has proved a deadly foe, So beware of his treachery.' Build houses, ere long, of stone or of bricks, And get tiles for your roofs, I pray; For I know, of old, Mr. Reynard's tricks, And I fear he may come any day.' Thus saying, she died, and her daughters fair, -- Gobble, Goosey, and Ganderee, -- Agreed together, that they would beware Of Mr. Fox, their enemy. But Gobble, the youngest, I grieve to say, Soon came to a very bad end, Because she preferred her own silly way, And would not to her mother attend. For she made, with some boards, an open nest, For a roof took the lid of a box; Then quietly laid herself down to rest, And thought she was safe from the Fox. But Reynard, in taking an evening run, Soon scented the goose near the pond; Thought he, ' Now I'll have some supper and fun, For of both I am really fond.' Then on to the box he sprang in a trice, And roused Mrs. Gobble from bed; She only had time to hiss once or twice Ere he snapped off her lily-white head. Her sisters at home felt anxious and low When poor Gobble did not appear, And Goosey, determined her fate to know, Went and sought all the field far and near. At last she descried poor Gobble's head, And some feathers not far apart, So she told Ganderee she had found her dead, And they both felt quite sad at heart. Now Goosey was pretty, but liked her own way, Like Gobble, and some other birds.' 'Tis no matter,' said she, 'if I only obey A part of my mother's last words.' So her house she soon built of nice red brick, But she only thatched it with straw; And she thought that, however the fox might kick, He could not get e'en a paw. So she went to sleep, and at dead of night She heard at the door a low scratch; And presently Reynard, with all his might, Attempted to jump on the thatch. But he tumbled back, and against the wall Grazed his nose in a fearful way, Then, almost mad with the pain of his fall, He barked, and ran slowly away. So Goosey laughed, and felt quite o'erjoyed To have thus escaped from all harm; But had she known how the Fox was employed, She would have felt dreadful alarm; For Gobble had been his last dainty meat, So hungry he really did feel, -- And resolved in his mind to accomplish this feat, And have the young goose for a meal. So he slyly lighted a bundle of straws, And made no more noise than a mouse, Then lifted himself up on his hind paws, And quickly set fire to the house. 'Twas soon in a blaze, and Goosey awoke, With fright almost ready to die, And, nearly smothered with heat and with smoke, Up the chimney was forced to fly. The Fox was rejoiced to witness her flight, And, heedless of all her sad groans, He chased her until he saw her alight, Then eat her up all but her bones. Poor Ganderee's heart was ready to break When the sad news reached her ear. ''Twas that villain the Fox,' said good Mr. Drake, Who lived in a pond very near. 'Now listen to me, I pray you,' he said, 'And roof your new house with some tiles, Or you, like your sisters, will soon be dead, -- A prey to your enemy's wiles.' So she took the advice of her mother and friend, And made her house very secure, Then she said, -- 'Now, whatever may be my end, The Fox cannot catch me, I'm sure.' He called at her door the very next day, And loudly and long did he knock, But she said to him, -- 'Leave my house, I pray, For the door I will not unlock; 'For you've killed my sisters I know full well, And you wish that I too were dead.' 'Oh dear,' said the Fox, ' I can't really tell Who put such a thought in your head: 'For I've always liked geese more than other birds, And you of your race I've loved best.' But the Goose ne'er heeded his flattering words, So hungry he went to his rest. Next week she beheld him again appear, 'Let me in very quick,' he cried, 'For the news I've to tell you'll be charmed to hear, And 'tis rude to keep me outside.' But the Goose only opened one window-pane, And popped out her pretty red bill, Said she, 'Your fair words are all in vain, But talk to me here if you will.' 'Tomorrow,' he cried, ' there will be a fair, All the birds and the beasts will go; So allow me, I pray, to escort you there, For you will be quite charmed I know.' 'Many thanks for your news,' said Ganderee, 'But I had rather not go with you; I care not for any gay sight to see,' -- So the window she closed, and withdrew. In the morning, howe'er, her mind she changed, And she thought she would go to the fair; So her numerous feathers she nicely arranged, And cleaned her red bill with much care. She went, I believe, before it was light, For of Reynard she felt much fear; So quickly she thought she would see each sight, And return ere he should appear. When the Goose arrived she began to laugh At the wondrous creatures she saw; There were dancing bears, and a tall giraffe, And a beautiful red macaw. A monkey was weighing out apples and roots; An ostrich, too, sold by retail; There were bees and butterflies tasting the fruits, And a pig drinking out of a pail. Ganderee went into an elephant's shop, And quickly she bought a new churn; For, as it grew late, she feared to stop, As in safety she wished to return. Ere, however, she got about half the way, She saw approaching her foe; And now she hissed with fear and dismay, For she knew not which way to go. But at last of a capital plan she bethought, Of a place where she safely might hide; She got into the churn that she had just bought, And then fastened the lid inside. The churn was placed on the brow of a hill, And with Ganderee's weight down it rolled, Passing the Fox, who stood perfectly still, Quite alarmed, though he was very bold. For the Goose's wings flapped strangely about, And the noise was fearful to hear; And so bruised she felt she was glad to get out, When she thought that the coast was clear. So safely she reached her own home at noon, And the Fox ne'er saw her that day; But after the fair he came very soon, And cried out in a terrible way, -- 'Quick, quick, let me in! oh, for once be kind, For the huntsman's horn I hear; Oh, hide me in any snug place you can find, For the hunters and hounds draw near.' So the Goose looked out in order to see Whether Reynard was only in jest; Then, knowing that he in her power would be, She opened the door to her guest. 'I'll hide you,' she said, ' in my nice new churn.' 'That will do very well,' said he; 'And thank you for doing me this good turn, Most friendly and kind Ganderee.' Then into the churn the Fox quickly got; But, ere the Goose put on the top, A kettle she brought of water quite hot, And poured in every drop. Then the Fox cried out, 'O! I burn, I burn, And I feel in a pitiful plight;' But the Goose held fast the lid of the churn, So Reynard he died that night.", "title": "The Fox and the Geese", "id": 495}
{"label": "670", "text": "When the serpent saw him, it screamed, 'Dear shepherd, do a good action; take me out of this fire.' The shepherd took pity on its words, and reached it his crook, and it crawled out upon it. When it had crawled out, it coiled itself round his neck. When the shepherd saw this, he was frightened, and said, 'Indeed you are a wretch! Is that the way you are going to thank me for rescuing you? So runs the proverb: 'Do good, and find evil.'' The serpent answered him, 'Don't fear. I shall do you no harm. Only carry me to my father; my father is the emperor of the serpents.' The shepherd begged pardon, and excused himself, 'I can't carry you to your father, because I have no one to leave in charge of my sheep.' The serpent said to him, 'Don't fear for your sheep; nothing will happen to them. Only carry me to my father, and go quickly.' Then there was no help for it, so he started with it over the hill. When he came to a door, which was formed of nothing but serpents intertwined, and went up to it, the serpent which was coiled round his neck gave a whistle, and the serpents, which had twined themselves into the form of a door, immediately untwined, and made way for them to enter. As the shepherd and the serpent entered the palace, the serpent called to the shepherd, 'Stop! Let me tell you something: when you come into my father's palace, he will promise you what you desire, silver and gold; but don't you accept anything, only ask him to give you such a tongue that you will be able to understand all animals. He will not give you this readily, but at last grant it you he will.' The shepherd went with it into its father's palace, and its father, on seeing it, shed tears, and asked it, 'Hey, my son, where have you been till now?' It replied, and told him everything in order: what had taken place, and how it had taken place, and how the shepherd had rescued it. Then the emperor of the serpents turned to the shepherd, and said to him, 'Come, my son, what do you wish me to give you in recompense for rescuing my child?' The shepherd replied to him, 'Nothing else, only give me such a tongue that I can understand all animals.' The emperor of the serpents said to him, 'That is not a proper gift for you, my son, because, if I give you anything of the kind, you will betray yourself in somebody's presence by boasting of it, and then you will die immediately. Ask something else.' The shepherd replied to him, 'I wish for nothing else. If you will give it me, give it; if not, farewell!' He turned to go; but the emperor of the serpents cried out, 'Stay! Return! If you ask this, come, that I may give it you. Open your mouth.' The shepherd opened his mouth, and the emperor of the serpents spat into it, and told him to spit also into his mouth. And thus they spat thrice into each other's mouths. When this was done, the emperor of the serpents said to the shepherd, 'Now you have the tongue which you desired. Go, and farewell! But it is not permitted you to tell anybody, because, if you do, you will die. I am telling you the truth.' The shepherd then departed. As he went over the hill, he understood the conversation of the birds, and, so to speak, of everything in the world. When he came to his sheep, he found them correct in number, and sat down to rest. But scarcely had he lain down, when two crows flew up, perched on a tree hard by him, and began to converse in their language, 'If that shepherd knew that just where that black lamb lies a vault full of silver and gold is buried in the ground, he would take its contents.' When he heard this, he went and told his master, and he brought a cart, and they broke open the door of the vault, and took out its valuable contents. His master was a righteous man, and said to him, 'Well, my son, this is all yours; the Lord has given it you. Go, provide a house, get married, and live comfortably.' The shepherd took the property, went away, provided a house, got married, and lived very comfortably. This shepherd, after a little time, became so rich and prosperous that there was nobody richer than he in his own or the neighboring villages. He had shepherds, cowherds, swineherds, grooms, and everything on a handsome scale. Once upon a time this shepherd ordered his wife on New Year's Eve to provide wine, brandy, and everything requisite, and to go the next morning to his cattle, to take the provisions to the herdsmen, that they, too, might enjoy themselves. His wife obeyed him, and did as her husband ordered her. The next day they got up, got ready, and went. When they arrived where the cattle were, the master said to his shepherds, 'Lads, assemble together, and sit down to eat and drink your fill, and I will watch the cattle tonight.' This was done; they assembled together, and he went out to sleep by the cattle. In the course of the night, after some time, the wolves began to howl and speak in their language, and the dogs to bark and speak in theirs. The wolves said, 'Can we capture any young cattle?' The dogs answered in their language, 'Come in, that we, too, may eat our fill of flesh.' But among the dogs there was one old dog, who had only two teeth left. This dog spoke and answered the wolves, 'In faith, as long as these two teeth of mine last, you shan't come near to do harm to my master.' In the morning, when it dawned, the master called the herdsmen, and told them to kill all the dogs except that old one. His servants began to implore him, 'Don't, master! Why? It's a sin.' But he said to them, 'Do just as I ordered you, and not otherwise.' Then he and his wife mounted their horses and went off. His wife rode a mare, and he a horse. As they went, the master's horse outstripped the wife's mare, and began to say to her in their language, 'Go quicker. Why do you hang back?' The mare's reply in defense of her lagging pace was so amusing that the man laughed out loud, turned his head, and looked behind him with a smile. His wife observed him smiling, whipped her mare to catch him up, and then asked him to tell her why he smiled. He said to her, 'Well, suppose I did? Something came into my head.' This answer did not satisfy her, but she began to worry him to tell her why he smiled. He said this and that to her to get out of it, but the more he said to get out of it, the more did she worry him. At length he said to her that, if he told her, he would die immediately. But she had no dread of her husband's dying, and went on worrying him: 'There is no alternative, but tell me you must.' When they got home, they dismounted from their horses, and as soon as they had done so, her husband ordered a grave to be dug for him. It was dug, and he lay down in it, and said to his wife, 'Did you not press me to tell you why I smiled? Come now, that I may tell you; but I shall die immediately.' On saying this, he gave one more look round him, and observed that the old dog had come from the cattle. Seeing this, he told his wife to give him a piece of bread. She gave it him, but the dog would not even look at it, but shed tears and wept. But the cock, seeing it, ran up and began to peck it. The dog was angry, and said, 'As if you'd die hungry! Don't you see that our master is going to die?' 'What a fool he is! Let him die! Whose fault is it? I have a hundred wives. When I find a grain of millet, I call them all to me, and finally eat it myself. If one of them gets cross at this, I give her one or two pecks, and she lowers her tail. But this man isn't equal to keeping one in order.' When the man heard the cock say this, he jumped up at once out of the grave, seized a stick, chased his wife over hill and dale, and at last settled her completely, so that it never entered her head any more to ask him why he smiled.", "title": "The Language of Animals (Bulgaria)", "id": 496}

Here the old man paused and glanced at the little boy, but it was evident that the youngster had become so accustomed to the marvelous developments of Uncle Remus's stories, that the extraordinary statement made no unusual impression upon him.  Therefore the old man began again, and this time in a louder arid more insinuating tone: 'One time ole man Rabbit, he wuz gwine 'long down de road shakin' his long, bushy tail, en feelin' mighty biggity.'  This was effective.  'Great goodness, Uncle Remus!' exclaimed the little boy in open-eyed wonder, 'everybody knows that rabbits haven't got long, bushy tails.'  The old man shifted his position in his chair and allowed his venerable head to drop forward until his whole appearance was suggestive of the deepest dejection; and this was intensified by a groan that seemed to be the result of great mental agony. Finally he spoke, but not as addressing himself to the little boy.

One day, when her mother had gone into the country and she was left alone in the house, she went into a church where the funeral service was being read over the body of a rich lady. The girl hid herself in the confessional. No one knew she was there. So, when the other people had gone, she was left alone with the corpse.

{"label": "2025", "text": "Now you shall hear a story that somebody's great-great-grandmother told a little girl ever so many years ago: There was once a little old man and a little old woman, who lived in a little old house in the edge of a wood. They would have been a very happy old couple but for one thing -- they had no little child, and they wished for one very much. One day, when the little old woman was baking gingerbread, she cut a cake in the shape of a little boy, and put it into the oven. Presently she went to the oven to see if it was baked. As soon as the oven door was opened, the little gingerbread boy jumped out, and began to run away as fast as he could go. The little old woman called her husband, and they both ran after him. But they could not catch him. And soon the gingerbread boy came to a barn full of threshers. He called out to them as he went by, saying: I've run away from a little old woman, A little old man, And I can run away from you, I can! Then the barn full of threshers set out to run after him. But, though they ran fast, they could not catch him. And he ran on till he came to a field full of mowers. He called out to them: A barn full of threshers, Then the mowers began to run after him, but they couldn't catch him. And he ran on till he came to a cow. He called out to her: A field full of mowers, But, though the cow started at once, she couldn't catch him. And soon he came to a pig. He called out to the pig: A cow, But the pig ran, and couldn't catch him. And he ran till he came across a fox, and to him he called out: A cow and a pig, Then the fox set out to run. Now foxes can run very fast, and so the fox soon caught the gingerbread boy and began to eat him up. Presently the gingerbread boy said, 'Oh dear! I'm quarter gone!' And then, 'Oh, I'm half gone!' And soon, 'I'm three-quarters gone!' And at last, 'I'm all gone!' and never spoke again. Editor's note:", "title": "The Gingerbread Boy (Gingerbread)", "id": 500}
{"label": "327", "text": "Once upon a time there was a peasant whose wife died, leaving him with two children -- twins -- a boy and a girl. For some years the poor man lived on alone with the children, caring for them as best he could; but everything in the house seemed to go wrong without a woman to look after it, and at last he made up his mind to marry again, feeling that a wife would bring peace and order to his household and take care of his motherless children. So he married, and in the following years several children were born to him; but peace and order did not come to the household. For the stepmother was very cruel to the twins, and beat them, and half starved them, and constantly drove them out of the house; for her one idea was to get them out of the way. All day she thought of nothing but how she should get rid of them; and at last an evil idea came into her head, and she determined to send them out into the great gloomy wood where a wicked witch lived. And so one morning she spoke to them, saying: 'You have been such good children that I am going to send you to visit my granny, who lives in a dear little hut in the wood. You will have to wait upon her and serve her, but you will be well rewarded, for she will give you the best of everything.' So the children left the house together; and the little sister, who was very wise for her years, said to the brother: 'We will first go and see our own dear grandmother, and tell her where our stepmother is sending us.' And when the grandmother heard where they were going, she cried and said: 'You poor motherless children! How I pity you; and yet I can do nothing to help you! Your stepmother is not sending you to her granny, but to a wicked witch who lives in that great gloomy wood. Now listen to me, children. You must be civil and kind to everyone, and never say a cross word to anyone, and never touch a crumb belonging to anyone else. Who knows if, after all, help may not be sent to you?' And she gave her grandchildren a bottle of milk and a piece of ham and a loaf of bread, and they set out for the great gloomy wood. When they reached it they saw in front of them, in the thickest of the trees, a queer little hut, and when they looked into it, there lay the witch, with her head on the threshold of the door, with one foot in one corner and the other in the other corner, and her knees cocked up, almost touching the ceiling. 'Who's there?' she snarled, in an awful voice, when she saw the children. And they answered civilly, though they were so terrified that they hid behind one another, and said: 'Good morning, granny; our stepmother has sent us to wait upon you, and serve you.' 'See that you do it well, then,' growled the witch. 'If I am pleased with you, I'll reward you; but if I am not, I'll put you in a pan and fry you in the oven -- that's what I'll do with you, my pretty dears! You have been gently reared, but you'll find my work hard enough. See if you don't.' And, so saying, she set the girl down to spin yarn, and she gave the boy a sieve in which to carry water from the well, and she herself went out into the wood. Now, as the girl was sitting at her distaff, weeping bitterly because she could not spin, she heard the sound of hundreds of little feet, and from every hole and corner in the hut mice came pattering along the floor, squeaking and saying: Little girl, why are your eyes so red? If you want help, then give us some bread. And the girl gave them the bread that her grandmother had given her. Then the mice told her that the witch had a cat, and the cat was very fond of ham; if she would give the cat her ham, it would show her the way out of the wood, and in the meantime they would spin the yarn for her. So the girl set out to look for the cat, and, as she was hunting about, she met her brother, in great trouble because he could not carry water from the well in a sieve, as it came pouring out as fast as he put it in. And as she was trying to comfort him they heard a rustling of wings, and a flight of wrens alighted on the ground beside them. And the wrens said: Give us some crumbs, then you need not grieve. For you'll find that water will stay in the sieve. Then the twins crumbled their bread on the ground, and the wrens pecked it, and chirruped and chirped. And when they had eaten the last crumb they told the boy to fill up the holes of the sieve with clay, and then to draw water from the well. So he did what they said, and carried the sieve full of water into the hut with out spilling a drop. When they entered the hut the cat was curled up on the floor. So they stroked her, and fed her with ham, and said to her: 'Pussy, grey pussy, tell us how we are to get away from the witch?' Then the cat thanked them for the ham, and gave them a pocket handkerchief and a comb, and told them that when the witch pursued them, as she certainly would, all they had to do was to throw the handkerchief on the ground and run as fast as they could. As soon as the handkerchief touched the ground a deep, broad river would spring up, which would hinder the witch's progress. If she managed to get across it, they must throw the comb behind them and run for their lives, for where the comb fell a dense forest would start up, which would delay the witch so long that they would be able to get safely away. The cat had scarcely finished speaking when the witch returned to see if the children had fulfilled their tasks. 'Well, you have done well enough for today,' she grumbled; 'but tomorrow you'll have something more difficult to do, and if you don't do it well, you pampered brats, straight into the oven you go.' Half dead with fright, and trembling in every limb, the poor children lay down to sleep on a heap of straw in the corner of the hut; but they dared not close their eyes, and scarcely ventured to breathe. In the morning the witch gave the girl two pieces of linen to weave before night, and the boy a pile of wood to cut into chips. Then the witch left them to their tasks, and went out into the wood. As soon as she had gone out of sight the children took the comb and the handkerchief, and, taking one another by the hand, they started and ran, and ran, and ran. And first they met the watchdog, who was going to leap on them and tear them to pieces; but they threw the remains of their bread to him, and he ate them and wagged his tail. Then they were hindered by the birch trees, whose branches almost put their eyes out. But the little sister tied the twigs together with a piece of ribbon, and they got past safely, and, after running through the wood, came out on to the open fields. In the meantime in the hut the cat was busy weaving the linen and tangling the threads as it wove. And the witch returned to see how the children were getting on; and she crept up to the window, and whispered: 'Are you weaving, my little dear?' 'Yes, granny, I am weaving,' answered the cat. When the witch saw that the children had escaped her, she was furious, and, hitting the cat with a porringer, she said: 'Why did you let the children leave the hut? Why did you not scratch their eyes out?' But the cat curled up its tail and put its back up, and answered: 'I have served you all these years and you never even threw me a bone, but the dear children gave me their own piece of ham.' Then the witch was furious with the watchdog and with the birch trees, because they had let the children pass. But the dog answered: 'I have served you all these years and you never gave me so much as a hard crust, but the dear children gave me their own loaf of bread.' And the birch rustled its leaves, and said: 'I have served you longer than I can say, and you never tied a bit of twine even round my branches; and the dear children bound them up with their brightest ribbons.' So the witch saw there was no help to be got from her old servants, and that the best thing she could do was to mount on her broom and set off in pursuit of the children. And as the children ran they heard the sound of the broom sweeping the ground close behind them, so instantly they threw the handkerchief down over their shoulder, and in a moment a deep, broad river flowed behind them. When the witch came up to it, it took her a long time before she found a place which she could ford over on her broomstick; but at last she got across, and continued the chase faster than before. And as the children ran they heard a sound, and the little sister put her ear to the ground, and heard the broom sweeping the earth close behind them; so, quick as thought, she threw the comb down on the ground, and in an instant, as the cat had said, a dense forest sprung up, in which the roots and branches were so closely intertwined, that it was impossible to force a way through it. So when the witch came up to it on her broom she found that there was nothing for it but to turn round and go back to her hut. But the twins ran straight on till they reached their own home.

But it happened within a little while that they were all weary of him, after that they had got what they had, and regarded him no more than a dog. The old man perceiving how he was slighted, went to an attorney to see if his skill could not afford him any help in his troubles. The attorney told him that no law in the land could help him nor yield him any comfort, but there was one thing only which would certainly do, which, if he would perform, he would reveal to him. At this the poor old man was exceeding glad, and desired him for God's sake to reveal the same, for he was almost pined and starved to death, and he would willingly do it rather than live as he did. 'Well,' says the lawyer, 'you have been a great friend of mine in my need, and I will now be one to you in your need. I will lend you a strongbox with a strong lock on it, in which shall be contained 1000 pounds. You shall on such a day pretend to have fetched it out of a closet, where it shall be supposed that you had hidden it, and carry it into one of your son's houses, and make it your business every week, while you are sojourning with such or such a son, to be always counting of the money, and rattling it about, and you shall see that, for love of it, they'll soon love you again, and make very much of you, and maintain you joyfully, willingly, and plentifully, unto your dying day.' The old man, having thanked the lawyer for this good advice and kind proffer, received within a few days the aforesaid box full of money, and having so managed it as above, his graceless sons soon fell in love with him again, and made mighty much of him, and perceiving that their love to him continued steadfast and firm, he one day took it out of the house and carried it to the lawyer, thanking him exceedingly for the loan thereof. But when he got to his sons he made them believe that he had hidden it again, and that he would give it to him of them whom he loved best when he died. This made them all so observant of him that he lived the rest of his days in great peace, plenty, and happiness amongst them, and died full of years. But a while before he died, he upbraided them for their former ingratitude, told them the whole history of the box, and forgave them.", "title": "Old Mr. Lacy and His Three Sons", "id": 503}

'That makes no difference now,' shouted the lion. 'But if you want to, we can go before a judge.' 'Good,' replied the horse. 'But whom shall we choose?' 'The fox,' said the lion.

'Yes,' answered the fox, 'it seems to me that you must be right, Mr. Lion, but I cannot finalize my judgment until I have seen how the two of you were standing.' So all three of them went to the rocky cleft, and the horse positioned himself in the same place he had stood. Then the fox told the lion to force himself back into the cleft.

{"label": "92", "text": "It chanced one day that while the lion was hunting for something to eat, he came across a hare sleeping behind a boulder; and seizing the hare in his great paws he was just about to devour him, when the hare spoke as follows: 'Oh! Uncle Lion,' said he, 'before eating me I just want to tell you about another animal who lives in that pond down there in the valley. He is very big and fierce, and I think he must be even stronger than you are. But if you will allow me to do so I will show you where he lives, and if you can succeed in killing him, he will make a very much better meal for you than a poor little beast like me.' On hearing this the lion was very indignant. 'What!' said he, 'do you mean to tell me that there is any animal in this country stronger and more powerful than I am? Don't you know that I am the lord of this district, and that I should never allow anyone else to dispute the mastery with me. Show me at once where this creature lives, and I will show you how I shall deal with him.' 'Oh! Uncle Lion,' said the hare, 'let me beg you to be careful. You have no idea what a big, strong creature this is; you must on no account allow yourself to be injured by fighting with him. Think what a grief it would be to us all if you were to come to any harm.' This remark of the hare's made the lion more angry than before, and he insisted that the hare should at once lead him down and show him where the other animal lived. So the hare, after again begging him to be careful of himself, preceded him down the hill until they arrived at the edge of a square-built stone tank, which was nearly full of water. 'Now, Uncle Lion,' said the hare, 'if you will go to the edge of that tank and look down into the water you will see the animal I speak of.' So saying he moved on one side, and the lion, stalking to the edge, peered down into the tank. The water was very smooth, and on the clear surface he saw his own head reflected. 'There he is,' called out the hare from the background; 'there he is, Uncle Lion, I can see him quite plainly in the water. You see how fierce he is looking; please be careful not to start fighting with him.' These remarks made the lion more angry than ever, and he moved up and down on the brink of the tank, glaring fiercely at his own reflection in the water, and growling and showing his teeth at it. 'That's right, Uncle Lion,' called out the hare; 'I am so glad you are taking good care of yourself. Don't on any account come to grips with that beast in the water, or he might do you an injury. You are certainly much safer on the bank, and no doubt you will frighten him if you continue to growl and show your teeth.' These last observations of the hare goaded the lion to desperation, and with a fierce roar he sprang straight at the image in the water. Once in the tank he was unable to get out, for its sides were built of masonry, and it was impossible for him to climb them. So he swam about for some time in the tank, whilst the hare, sitting on the bank, threw stones at him and made nasty remarks; and finally, when quite wearied out, he sank to the bottom and was drowned. The hare was very pleased at having accomplished the destruction of the lion, and he now turned his attention to the lioness. It happened that nearby there was a thick wall standing, which was part of the remains of a ruined castle; and in one portion of the wall there was a hole, very large at one end and tapering down to quite a small opening at the other. The hare, having studied his ground, went off next morning to find the lioness. He soon came across her stalking up and down near her den, very much perturbed at the disappearance of her lord and master. 'Good-morning, Aunt Lioness,' said the hare, going up cautiously towards her; 'what is the matter with you this morning? How is it I find you pacing here in front of your den instead of hunting your prey as usual on the hillside?' The lioness took no notice of the hare, except to growl at him in an angry manner, and to lash her sides with her tail. 'I suppose,' went on the hare, 'you are anxious about Mr. Lion, but I am sorry to tell you that you are not likely to see him again for some time. The fact is, he and I had a little argument yesterday, in which we both lost our tempers. It ended in our having a free fight, and I regret to say that I was obliged to injure Mr. Lion rather severely before I could make him see reason, and he is now lying in a dying state in the valley below.' This impudence so enraged the lioness that she sprang towards the hare and endeavoured to seize him; but he eluded her and galloped off down the hill hotly pursued by the angry beast. The hare made straight for the ruined wall, and entering the breach in the wall at the large end he emerged safely at the other side by the smaller recess, which was just large enough for him to pass through. The lioness, following closely at his heels, was so blind with rage that she did not see that she was being led into a trap; so she rushed head-foremost into the opening in the wall, and before she had time to stop herself was wedged tightly in the tapering hole. She struggled violently, trying to extricate herself, but all in vain. Meanwhile the hare, having cantered round to the other side, took up its position in rear of the lioness, and began pelting her with stones and calling her all the bad names he could think of. When he was tired of this he went off home very pleased with himself, and the lioness, being unable to free herself from the trap she was in, shortly afterwards starved to death.", "title": "The Hare and the Lions", "id": 507}

{"label": "1676", "text": "According to tradition, Meg of Meldon was stigmatized as a witch during her lifetime in seventeenth-century Northumberland. After her death she reappeared as a ghost at regular intervals, apparently with the only goal to frighten people. An individual, well known for his skepticism in regard to ghosts, had frequently heard of Meg's achievements in frightening people, but would not credit them. He, however, had no scruple in perpetuating the belief among the credulous, so one mirk night, dressed in white, he placed himself on the parapet wall of Meldon Bridge, and there sat awaiting passers-by. He had not stayed long till he found Meg herself seated alongside of him. 'You've come to fley [frighten],' said she, 'and I've come to fley, let's baith fley thegither.' At the same time she drew herself a little nearer him, while he, jealous of a too familiar intimacy, moved still further along. Meg repeated her movement, and he still shrunk from her approach. She at length came so close as to give him a push, which he hastily attempted to shun, but lost balance, and fell headlong into the water. Let us hope that Meg was rewarded with a respite for ducking the rival ghost. Another adventure in which Meg was concerned was sent me in 1877 by a clergyman in that neighborhood, in the hand writing of the narrator, a tradesman, I believe, in Whalton. I shall reproduce it pretty nearly in the language in which it was told. Two dwellers in the hamlet of Thornton who believed in Meg's appearance as a ghost, and a friend of theirs, a Scotchman, who could not be brought to credit it, sat one night after having been at the smithy, in a public house at Meldon, disputing as to her existence or non existence as a spiritual visitant. They then left in company for Thornton. At a certain part of the road one of the two believers, named Todd, gave some chains he was carrying from the smith's shop to his mate and fell behind. As soon as the other two were out of sight and hearing, he took a shortcut across a corner of a field and placed himself behind a hedge at the foot of a bank, a favorite haunt of Meg, and getting himself into the most ghostly style he could assume, he awaited their arrival. The Scotchman came up first, shouting, 'Where are ye, Meg? Let's see you, Meg!' when Todd stepped out into view, saying, 'Here's Meg, what want ye wi' Meg?' The other lad dropped the chains and made off, and the Scotchman after him. Todd, thinking he had overdone the thing, picked up the chains and ran after them to stop them, but the faster he ran the faster ran they, the tinkling of the chains behind keeping up their terror. The two lads had got upon Meldon Bridge over the Wansbeck, which was then a very narrow and steep structure. At the one end of it they disturbed a kyloe [a breed of Scottish highland cattle] that had got out of a field. This started out as Todd was passing, and 'gave a rout,' and ran headlong across the bridge behind him. Todd, taking the beast for Meg, increased his speed, the most frightened of the three. Thus there were three men and a kyloe all terrified and running at their utmost pith. The three men arrived home in a serious state of fear, from which they were long recovering. The narrator adds a remark of identification. 'Todd was said to be the father or grandfather to Jack Todd, the wood wagoner. Both the public houses in Meldon were closed before my day.'", "title": "Meg of Meldon", "id": 509}

{"label": "850", "text": "There was once a poor prince; he had only a tiny kingdom, but it was big enough to allow him to marry, and he was bent upon marrying. Now, it certainly was rather bold of him to say to the emperor's daughter, 'Will you have me?' He did, however, venture to say so, for his name was known far and wide; and there were hundreds of princesses who would have said 'Yes,' and 'Thank you, kindly,' but see if she would! Just let us hear about it. A rose tree grew on the grave of the prince's father, it was such a beautiful rose tree. It only bloomed every fifth year, and then only bore one blossom; but what a rose that was! By merely smelling it one forgot all one's cares and sorrows. He also had a nightingale which sang as if every lovely melody in the world dwelt in its little throat. This rose and this nightingale were to be given to the princess, so they were put into great silver caskets and sent to her. The emperor had them carried before him into the great hall where the princess was playing house with her ladies-in-waiting. They had nothing else to do. When she saw the caskets with the gifts she clapped her hands with delight! 'If only it were a little kitten!' said she, -- but there was the lovely rose. 'Oh, how exquisitely it is made!' said all the ladies-in-waiting. 'It is more than beautiful,' said the emperor. 'It is nice.' But the princess touched it, and then she was ready to cry. 'Fie, papa!' she said. 'It is not artificial. It is a real one!' 'Fie!' said all the ladies-in-waiting. 'It is a real one!' 'Well, let us see what there is in the other casket, before we get angry,' said the emperor, and out came the nightingale. It sang so beautifully that at first no one could find anything to say against it. 'Superbe! Charmant!' said the ladies-in-waiting, for they all spoke French, each one worse than the others. 'How that bird reminds me of our late empress's musical box,' said an old courtier. ' Ah, yes, they are the same tunes, and the same beautiful performance.' 'So they are,' said the emperor, and he cried like a little child. 'I should hardly think it could be a real one,' said the princess. 'Yes, it is a real one,' said those who had brought it. 'Oh, let that bird fly away then,' said the princess, and she would not hear of allowing the prince to come. But the prince was not to be crushed. He stained his face brown and black, and, pressing his cap over his eyes, he knocked at the door. 'Good morning, emperor,' said he; 'can I be taken into service in the palace?' 'Well, there are so many wishing to do that,' said the emperor; 'but let me see! -- Yes, I need somebody to look after the pigs, for we have so many of them.' So the prince was made imperial swineherd. A horrid little room was given him near the pig-sties, and here he had to live. He sat busily at work all day, and by the evening he had made a beautiful little cooking pot. It had bells all round it and when the pot boiled they tinkled delightfully and played the old tune: Ach du lieber Augustin, Alles ist weg, weg, weg! But the greatest charm of all about it was, that by holding one's finger in the steam one could immediately smell all the dinners that were being cooked at every stove in the town. Now this was a very different matter from a rose. The princess came walking along with all her ladies-in-waiting, and when she heard the tune she stopped and looked pleased, for she herself could play its melody on the piano, but only with one finger. 'Why, that is my song,' she said. 'This must be a cultivated swineherd. Go and ask him what the instrument costs.' So one of the ladies-in-waiting had to go into his room, but she put clogs on first. 'How much do you want for the pot,' she asked. 'I must have ten kisses from the princess,' said the swineherd. 'Heaven preserve us!' said the lady. 'I won't take less,' said the swineherd. 'Well, what does he say?' asked the princess. 'I really cannot tell you,' said the lady-in-waiting. 'It is so shocking.' 'Then you must whisper it.' And she whispered it. 'He is a wretch!' said the princess, and went away at once. But she had only gone a little way when she heard the bells tinkling beautifully: Ach du lieber Augustin. 'Go and ask him if he will take ten kisses from the ladies-in-waiting.' 'No, thank you,' said the swineherd. 'Ten kisses from the princess, or I keep my pot.' 'How tiresome it is,' said the princess. 'Then you will have to stand round me, so that no one may see.' So the ladies-in-waiting stood round her and spread out their skirts while the swineherd took his ten kisses, and then the pot was hers. What a delight it was to them. The pot was kept on the boil day and night. They knew what was cooking on every stove in the town, from the chamberlain's to the shoemaker's. The ladies-in-waiting danced about and clapped their hands. 'We know who has sweet soup and pancakes for dinner, and who has cutlets. How amusing it is.' 'Highly interesting,' said the mistress of the robes. 'Yes, but hold your tongues, for I am the emperor's daughter.' 'Heaven preserve us!' they all said. The swineherd -- that is to say, the prince, only nobody knew that he was not a real swineherd -- did not let the day pass in idleness, and he now constructed a rattle. When it was swung round it played all the waltzes, gallops and jig tunes which have ever been heard since the creation of the world. 'But this is superbe!' said the princess, as she walked by. 'I have never heard finer compositions. Go and ask him what the instrument costs, but let us have no more kissing.' 'He wants a hundred kisses from the princess!' said the lady-in-waiting. 'I think he is mad!' said the princess, and she went away, but she had not gone far when she stopped. 'One must encourage art,' she said; 'I am the emperor's daughter. Tell him he can have ten kisses, the same as yesterday, and he can take the others from the ladies-in-waiting.' 'But we don't like that at all,' said the ladies. 'Oh, nonsense! If I can kiss him you can do the same. Remember that I pay your wages as well as give you board and lodging.' So the lady-in-waiting had to go again. 'A hundred kisses from the princess, or let each keep his own.' 'Stand in front of me,' said she, and all the ladies stood round, while he kissed her. 'Whatever is the meaning of that crowd round the pig-sties?' said the emperor as he stepped out onto the balcony; he rubbed his eyes and put on his spectacles. 'Why it is the ladies-in-waiting, what game are they up to? I must go and see!' So he pulled up the heels of his slippers for they were shoes which he had trodden down. Bless us, what a hurry he was in! When he got into the yard, he walked very softly and the ladies were so busy counting the kisses, so that there should be fair play, and neither too few nor too many kisses, that they never heard the emperor. He stood on tiptoe. 'What is all this?' he said when he saw what was going on, and he hit them on the head with his slipper just as the swineherd was taking the eighty-sixth kiss. 'Out you go!' said the emperor, for he was furious, and both the princess and the prince were put out of his realm. There she stood crying, and the swineherd scolded, and the rain poured down in torrents. 'Oh, miserable creature that I am! If only I had accepted the handsome prince. Oh, how unhappy I am!' The swineherd went behind a tree, wiped the black and brown stain from his face, and threw away his ugly clothes. Then he stepped out dressed as a prince. He was so handsome that the princess could not help curtseying to him. 'I am come to despise you,' he said. 'You would not have an honorable prince, you could not prize the rose or the nightingale, but you would kiss the swineherd for a trumpery musical box! As you have made your bed, so must you lie upon it!' Then he went back into his own little kingdom and shut and locked, the door. So she had to stand outside and sing in earnest: Ach du lieber Augustin Alles ist weg, weg, weg! 'The Swineherd' has a few traits in common with an old Danish folktale that I heard as a child. It was, however, too indecent to be repeated. (H. C. Andersens Samlede Skrifter, vol. 15 [Copenhagen: C. A. Reitzels Forlag, 1880], p. 299).", "title": "The Swineherd", "id": 511}
{"label": "850", "text": "A long time ago there lived a poor woman, who possessed nothing in the world except one son and four lambs. The boy took the lambs out to graze every morning, and brought them home every night. One day it happened that the lambs were grazing in a field not far from the summer palace of the king, and the king's daughter came out to the young shepherd and asked him to give her one of them. The boy refused, saying, 'I cannot give you one, for my mother will scold me if I do, as we have nothing in the world except these four lambs.' The princess, however, had taken so great a fancy for a lamb that she would not be refused, and at last said, 'Only let me have this one and I will give you any price you like to ask.' The boy, seeing that the princess would not go away without a lamb, considered a little how he could get rid of her, and then he told her that he would give her one if she would show him one of her shoulders. To his great surprise the princess, without any hesitation, pushed her mantle aside and showed him her bare white arm, and he noticed that on the shoulder there was a mark like a star. He was obliged now to give her one of his lambs, and when he went home in the evening he told his mother that he had fallen asleep at noon, and that when he awoke, one of the lambs had vanished, and he could not find it anywhere. Then his mother scolded him very much, saying, 'I see you will bring me to the beggar's staff with your carelessness! Tomorrow you must take these three lambs out to graze very early, and look well about for the lost one. And if you don't find it you had better never let me set eyes on you again.' At dawn the next day the boy took the three lambs to graze in the same field, and sat down to consider how he could get back the lamb he had lost. At noon, when no one was about, the king's daughter came out of the palace and said to him, 'Young shepherd, give me another lamb, and ask what you please in return.' But the boy answered, 'No! I dare not give you another; I have suffered enough for the one I gave you yesterday! So please go and bring me my lamb back.' This the princess refused to do, and said, 'It is quite useless to speak of such a thing. But tell me, did you notice anything particular on my shoulder?' The youth answered, 'Yes, I saw a star!' 'Ah!' exclaimed the princess; 'for that you can never pay me enough, and yet you want your lamb back!' So they almost quarreled, for the king's daughter persisted in begging him to give her another lamb, and the young shepherd insisted that she should bring him the first one back again. At last, seeing there was no end to her begging, the boy said, 'Well! I will give you one if you uncover before me your other shoulder.' This the princess did instantly, and he noticed that she had the mark of a star on that arm also. In this way he lost a second lamb; and when the evening came he went home very sadly, feeling sure his mother would scold him. And so she did, far more than at the first time, calling him ill names and threatening to beat him. The boy was really sorry that he had given way to the princess's pleas, but he could not help it now. Next day, again, the princess came to him and begged so hard and so long for a third lamb that he became impatient, and, thinking to shame her, said he would give her one if she showed him her neck. To his great surprise, however, the king's daughter at once let her mantle fall, and he saw that she had the mark of a crescent on her throat. So the poor boy lost a third lamb, and hardly dared go home to his mother at night with the one lamb left them. Indeed the poor old woman was so angry at her son's carelessness in losing one lamb after another whilst he slept -- for he did not dare to tell her the truth about the princess -- that she cursed him as 'a good-for-nothing who would bring her to beggary.' Notwithstanding all his mother's reproaches and threats the boy could not refuse the princess the next day when she came out to ask for the fourth lamb. However, he tried to get her to go away a long time, and not until quite tired out with her begging, did he exclaim, 'Well, I will give you the lamb if you will show me your breast!' Then the princess pushed her robe aside, and the boy noticed that she had the mark of a sun on her bosom. In this way the young shepherd lost all the four lambs, and he lived a long time with his mother in great poverty. A long, long time afterwards the king sent out a proclamation that he intended to let his daughter marry, and would give her to that man who could tell him what particular birthmarks she had about her. The young shepherd heard this proclamation, and when he went home in the evening he said to his mother, 'Mother, I intend to go to the king's palace tomorrow, so get me my best linen ready.' 'And what do you want in the king's palace?' asked the poor old woman wondering. 'I intend, God helping me, to marry the king's daughter,' replied the young man boldly. 'Oh! you had better give up that fancy,' cried the mother. 'It will be better for you to go and work and gain a piaster than to go, like a fly without a head, dreaming about things that are as high as the sky above you.' But the young man would not be persuaded, and went the next day to the king's palace. Before going out of the hut, however, he said to his anxious old mother, 'Good-bye, mother.' He had not walked very far before a gipsy met him, and asked, 'Where are you going, my young man?' 'I am going to the king's palace,' answered the youth, 'and I mean, God helping me, to marry the king's daughter.' 'But, my dear comrade,' said the gipsy, keeping near him, 'how can you really expect that she will marry you, when you are so poor? Only a shepherd!' 'Eh!' returned the young man; 'but I know what birthmarks she has, and the king has sent out a proclamation that whoever guesses these shall have her for his wife.' 'If it is so,' rejoined the cunning gipsy, 'I myself will also go to the palace with you.' The young man was glad to have company on the road, and so he and the gipsy travelled on together until they came to the residence of the king. When they came to the palace they found a large number of people who had come to 'try their luck,' and guess what birthmarks the princess had. But it was lost time, for every one of them, after going past the king and guessing 'by good luck' at the marks of the princess, was obliged to go away, having lost his time and gained nothing. At length the turn came for the young shepherd to pass before the king, and the gipsy kept close to him to hear what he would say. So the youth stepped before the king and said, 'The princess has a star on each shoulder, and a crescent on the throat.' At this moment the gipsy shouted loudly, 'Look there! That is just what I was going to say!' 'Be quiet!' said the young shepherd; 'or, if you really know what other marks she has, speak out.' 'No, no!' cried the gipsy, 'Go on, go on! When you have done, I will speak what I know!' Then the youth turned again to the king and continued, 'The princess has the mark of a sun on her bosom.' 'That is exactly what I was going to say!' cried the gipsy, coming up quickly; 'She has the mark of a sun on her breast.' Now the king was exceeding surprised, and confessed to his counsellors that the young shepherd had really guessed the truth. But as neither the king nor the counsellors at all liked the idea of the princess marrying a poor shepherd, they consulted how they could get rid of him without giving the lie to the king's proclamation. At length it was decided that his majesty should say, 'As both the shepherd and the gipsy have guessed the princess's birthmarks, I cannot justly decide which of them should marry her. But I will give to each of them seventy piasters, and they must both go and trade with this money for a year. At the end of the year, that one which brings back the most money shall have the princess for his wife.' The young shepherd and the gipsy, having received the money, went off in opposite directions to seek their fortunes. After having travelled about some time the shepherd stopped one night to rest in the hut of an old woman, who was even poorer than his own mother. As he sat with the old woman in the hut that evening, the lad thought he might just as well ask her advice as to the best way to invest his capital of seventy piasters, so he said, 'I have seventy piasters to trade with, can you tell me some good way in which I may employ them profitably?' The old woman considered the matter for some time before she answered, and then said, 'Tomorrow is market day in the next city; go there yourself, and when a man brings a very poor cow for sale, go up and try to buy it. The cow will be of many different colors, but very thin and ill fed; but you must buy her at whatever price the man asks for her. When you have bought her, bring her here at once.' The young man agreed to follow the old woman's counsel, and so next day he went to the city and really found there a man who had brought a poor, but variously colored, cow to sell. Many people wished to buy the cow, but the young man outbid them all, and at length offered all his seventy piasters for her. So he got the cow, and drove it to the hut where he had passed the night. When the old woman came out to see who was coming, he called out to her, 'Now, my old mother, I have bought the cow, and what shall we do with her? She has cost me all my capital!' The old woman answered at once, 'Kill the cow, my son, and cut it in pieces.' 'But how will that bring me back my money with profit?' asked the young shepherd, hesitating whether he should follow her advice or no. 'Don't be afraid, my son, but do as I say,' returned the old woman. Accordingly he did as she advised him, killed the cow and cut her into pieces. This done, he asked again, 'And now, what shall I do?' The old woman said quietly, 'Well, now we will eat the meat, and the suet we will melt down and put into a pot to keep for some other occasion.' The shepherd did not at all like this proposal, for he could not see what return he could hope to get for such an investment of his capital. However, he thought within himself, 'Well, since I have been foolish enough to follow her counsel on the two former occasions, I may as well follow it also this third time.' So he remained with the old woman many days, until the last piece of meat had been eaten up. When, however, he thought over all that had happened, he grew very sad, and, seeing no sign of anything better, said one morning to the old woman reproachfully, 'Now you see by following your counsel I have spent all the king's money, and am now a ruined man!' 'Don't be afraid, my son,' said the old woman. 'You can now take that pot of suet with you and go to a certain country where all the people are suffering from a strange disease, and there you can sell for a good deal of money your suet, for it has the power to cure them.' The poor shepherd was very glad at hearing this, and next morning took the pot of suet on his shoulder and started on his journey. After he had travelled many, many days, he came to a strange-looking country, and, going a little farther, he discovered that the old woman had told the truth. All the citizens, from the poorest beggar to the king himself were suffering from a disease that no doctor had been able to cure. However, the shepherd's suet performed miracles, and in short order the sufferers were again all healthy and vigorous. The grateful king responded to the shepherd's miracle with the promise, 'Only ask! I will give you whatever you wish, even if it be my throne!' 'I thank your Majesty very humbly for offering me your throne, but I don't want it,' replied the shepherd; 'but if you will give me three ships full of gold and silver, and some good sailors to manage the ships, and some good soldiers and cannons to defend them against the pirates, I shall think myself more than repaid, and I will send you back the ships and cannons when the gold and silver are landed safely in my country.' Then the king at once gave the necessary orders, and in a very few days his servants came to report to him that the ships were then filled with gold and silver, and that the cannons were ready loaded and posted for action, and all the sailors and soldiers prepared to fight if any sea-robber came in their way. Then the young shepherd took a courteous leave of the king, and of all those other people who were so thankful to him for having cured them of their illness. He now went on board one of the ships, very glad to go back to his own country, and the two other ships full of gold and silver followed the first one across the seas. After having sailed a long time the three ships reached at last the coast of the kingdom where the king was waiting, daily expecting the return of the gipsy and shepherd to claim his daughter. The shepherd let his ships lie quietly in the harbor one day, and then, noticing much tumult and disturbance in the city, went ashore to see what had happened. There he found a great crowd, and on asking some of the people what they were going to do, they told him that they were going to hang a gipsy who had come to the city with seventy piasters capital, and who had not only spent all his money in drinking and reveling, but had even got into debt for seventy other piasters which he was quite unable to pay, and that this was the reason they were about to hang him. In a few moments the hangman appeared, leading the gipsy, who was no other than the very man who had tried to cheat the shepherd out of the princess. The young shepherd recognized his rival at once, and, going near him, said, 'What is this, my old friend? Have you really come to this?' The instant the gipsy saw the shepherd he stopped and began to whine and wail, begging him to save him from the gibbet, and he would be his faithful servant all his life. 'As for the princess,' he added cunningly, 'I have given her up a long time ago, and don't care for anything if only my life is spared.' Then the young shepherd was sorry for the poor trembling, whining wretch, and offered to pay the debt for the gipsy if the people would let him off. So they agreed to this, and the young man not only paid the seventy piasters the gipsy owed, but bought him besides a suit of good clothes as well as a carriage and a pair of fine horses. Then he left him and went back to his ships, and they sailed on slowly along the coast towards the king's residence. Now when the gipsy had dressed himself out smartly in his fine new clothes, he got into his carriage and drove off quickly to the king's palace. Arrived there, he left his carriage and horses in the courtyard, and went at once to the presence of the king, whom he addressed thus: 'Your majesty knows it is not yet quite a year since you gave me seventy piasters to trade with, and see! I come back already handsomely dressed, and have a fine carriage with a pair of beautiful horses below in the yard. As for the young shepherd, I have heard that he has not only spent all your majesty's money in rioting, but that he had also got in debt, for which he has been hung. So it is no use waiting for him! Let us keep my wedding at once!' The king did not fancy the gipsy for his son-in-law, and was thinking what he could say to put him off a little time, when, looking by chance through his window, he saw three strange-looking ships sailing slowly towards the shore. At this he exclaimed, 'I see some foreign visitors are coming to visit me, and I shall have enough to do to receive them with due honors, so we must put off the marriage for some days, at least!' But the gipsy pressed the king more and more to let him marry the princess at once; he was even bold enough to tell his Majesty that he could not wait any longer, and that the wedding would be all over in an hour. The king, however, refused to hear anything of this; so the gipsy, seeing that his plan had failed, went out from the presence of the king in great anger. A few hours later the three strange-looking ships dropped their anchors just opposite the palace, and the young shepherd, landing, came into the presence of the king, who was greatly astonished to see him alive, and still more astonished to hear that in return for his seventy piasters he had brought three vessels full of gold and silver. The king was now very well content to accept him as his son-in-law, and told him, in the course of conversation, what the gipsy had said about his having gone in debt and been hung. Then the young shepherd told his Majesty how he had found the gipsy, and had saved his life by paying his debt for him. The king was exceedingly angry, and ordered his servants to go after the gipsy and bring him at once into his presence. The servants looked about and around the palace on all sides, but nowhere could they find any trace of the gipsy. Then the king commanded that some of them should go in search of him without delay, and armed men were speedily scattered over the whole country, so that at last he was caught, and brought before the king, who condemned him to be hung for having so shamefully tried to injure the man who had saved his life and treated him so generously, and for having, at the same time, attempted to cheat the king. The young shepherd spent a few days in the palace, telling the king all the things he had seen abroad, and then, all preparations having been made, he was married to the princess, with great pomp and rejoicings. Then the king with his daughter and son-in-law lived for a great many years very happily.", "title": "The Shepherd and the King's Daughter", "id": 512}
{"label": "955", "text": "In the Western Isles of Scotland there lived a very rich man, of the name of Gregory, who had two beautiful daughters, to whom he was inordinately attached, but being vastly rich, he would not suffer either of them to go for an hour out of his presence without a strong detachment of the inmates of his house accompanying them wherever they went; and for the purpose of defending them from violent attacks that might be made upon them, or being carried off by the lawless banditti who at that time infested that part of the country. It happened, however, one day when they were at their usual walk and recreation, a little distance from their house, there came up to them a gentleman with his servant on horseback, who accosted them in a rather familiar way, asking them if those men they saw at a little distance were attendants of theirs? They were answered in the affirmative. He also put some other questions to them which they did not choose to answer. One of the ladies then wished to know how he was so impertinent; when he replied that, being much attached to the elder of the two, her beauty being so enchanting, he broke through the rules of good breeding. As flattery has too often the desired effect of gaining its purpose over silly minds, it wrought upon this lady like a charm, and made her the more attentive to his bewitching strain, Having so far gained her heart and confidence, he next got all the information that he wanted regarding her place of residence, and other particulars, with liberty to visit her as a suitor. These preliminaries having been settled, the ladies returned home, attended by the stranger gentleman, who gave his name as Mr. Greenwood, proprietor of an extensive tract of land on one of the neighbouring islands. His visits becoming so frequent, and himself so familiar, that at length he entreated the lady, his sweetheart, to pay a visit in return to his castle, as it was but a short way off, to which she consented. The necessary instructions were given her for finding the castle secretly, as she could not go openly for fear of her father, he not permitting her to go anywhere without her usual guard of attendants. She behoved, therefore, to steal away in his absence. The time for this purpose being agreed upon, as it was expected her father would leave home in a few days; but as some secret forebodings of evil preyed much upon her mind, she thought it advisable to go to the place he had appointed some days previous to the time they were to meet. The impropriety of venturing alone, and to a place she knew not, and to meet with one with whom she was so little acquainted, seemed very improper. Having deliberately weighed the matter in her own mind, she thought it better to go in disguise and reconnoitre his dwelling and circumstances. Accordingly, she got herself dressed in all the tattered and torn habiliments of an old beggar woman, and went as proposed, asking alms on her way thither. On her arriving at Greenwood's castle, she knocked loudly, but as no one appeared, she ventured in, as the door was unlocked, and destitute of a bolt for its security. Her first movement was to examine the contents of a pot which boiled on the fire, but on looking in, she saw such a sight as quite horrified her -- it was part of a human body! She next observed a bundle of rusty keys to lie on a table in the kitchen. When taking them up, she applied one of them to the door of a room which was adjoining the kitchen. In this room hung men's clothes of every description; out of each dress she cut a swatch, which having pocketed, she went to another room, when having opened it also, there she found women's dresses of great variety; some new, and some old. Out of each of them she cut again. Her next adventure was down a small trap-door, where, when she arrived at the bottom, she was up to the knees in blood, at which she greatly wondered ; but in the midst of her astonishment, from one of the dark corners of this dreadful vault, a voice said: O, dear lady Maisry, be not so bold, Lest your warm heart blood soon turn as cold. On hearing these words, she immediately fled from this ocean of blood, and ascended with a quick though palsied step, till she arrived at its summit. On beholding the light, she was put to her wits' end how she should make her escape from this place of skulls, which she never thought of till now. On ruminating on these things, her eyes were shocked with the cannibal owner of the place and his servant dragging triumphantly by the hair of the head, the dead body of a murdered female. As they came hurriedly into the room upon her, she had little time to seek a hiding place, or meditate her escape; so fled behind a door which stood half open between them, but so placed as she could hear and see what passed without being observed by the other party. Near this place lay a large bloodhound, to which she threw a piece of bread and thereby gained his favour. Greenwood then cut off one of the female's hands and threw it to the dog; but as Maisry had so lately given him a piece of bread, she was suffered to take it up and carry it away. Having continued in this precarious situation for a wearyful length of time, Greenwood remarked to his man, that he smelled fresh blood. The servant, with some difficulty, got him persuaded that the smell arose from the hand which he had so recently cut off from the dead body and thrown to the dog. He was also with some reluctance appeased in his rage towards one of his domestics that had offended him. However, he determined that on going to bed, all the doors should be well secured inside, so that none could make their escape ere morning, if any were in the house that did not belong to it; and for their better security, should have their beds made at one of the back doors of the castle. On their going to bed, as fate would have it, sleep took such strong hold of their senses that they were soon in the arms of the drowsy god and snored aloud. It was now time for the lady to think of saving herself by flight, which she accomplished in the following surprising manner. She opened the door, and at once made such a spring over both of their bodies, as cleared them and the place of her confinement. She then fled with the rapidity of lightning. The jump which she took awoke Greenwood, who said, surely someone had escaped; but the servant insisted that it was only the flutter of a bird that had passed the door. Unconcernedly they then went to sleep again. The lady having reached her father's house, caused a great party of her friends and acquaintances to be invited to a feast which was to be prepared for their entertainment, about the time that Greenwood had promised to give her a call. All things being ready, and the guests at supper set, Greenwood among the rest, when all were merry, and all seemed to enjoy the entertainment. Supper at length being ended, it was proposed that a few songs for the amusement of the company, should be sung by those who could, and those who could not sing should tell some story or tale. This being agreed upon by all, songs were sung and tales were told by all till it came to Maisry's turn, who said, as she could do neither she would tell a dream she dreamed last night; and looking over to Greenwood, remarked that it was concerning him. All seemed anxious to hear it, but none more so than Greenwood, when she began thus: I thought that I disguised myself as a common pauper, and went to your castle to ask alms, but after loudly knocking, and finding no one to make answer, I ventured in, and seeing a pot boiling on the fire, a thought struck me to look into it, I saw what I could scarcely believe, a part of a human body. This having raised my curiosity, I went a step farther and on finding a bunch of keys lying on a table near where I stood; I opened an apartment near the kitchen, and found a variety of men's clothes; next I went into another, where I found women's and cut a piece out of each of them, which I brought along. I also ventured down a small trap stair, when I found myself up to the knees among blood, and a voice saying: Greenwood could contain himself no longer, but interrupting her said, 'Women's dreams are fabulous, and so are women's thoughts. Jack, saddle your horse, and we will go ride.' But she would not consent to this, but continued to tell the rest of her dream, much against his wish or inclination; but there was no avoiding hearing her out, so she went on, 'On arriving at the top of the trap stair which I went down to the vault of blood, I observed you and your man dragging by the hair of her head, the body of a dead lady. You cut off one of her hands and threw it to a greedy bloodhound which lay near where I stood. The hand I took up, and see here it is,' producing the bloody hand before them all; when, to his mortification and confusion, he and his servant were secured. He to be burned in the midst of his castle, which was in a remote and secret place of a large wood; the servant to be drowned; which were immediately put into execution, to the no small satisfaction and amazement of all who heard his murderous history.", "title": "The History of Mr. Greenwood", "id": 513}
{"label": "113A", "text": "A man once, in a fit of passion, cut off the head of the domestic pussy, and threw it on the fire. On which the head exclaimed, in a fierce voice, 'Go tell your wife that you have cut off the head of the King of the Cats; but wait! I shall come back and be avenged for this insult,' and the eyes of the cat glared at him horribly from the fire. And so it happened; for that day year, while the master of the house was playing with a pet kitten, it suddenly flew at his throat and bit him so severely that he died soon after. A story is current also, that one night an old woman was sitting up very late spinning, when a knocking came to the door. 'Who is there?' she asked. No answer; but still the knocking went on. 'Who is there?' she asked a second time. No answer; and the knocking continued. 'Who is there?' she asked the third time, in a very angry passion. Then there came a small voice, 'Ah, Judy, agrah, let me in, for I am cold and hungry; open the door, Judy, agrah, and let me sit by the fire, for the night is cold out here. Judy, agrah, let me in, let me in!' The heart of Judy was touched, for she thought it was some small child that had lost its way, and she rose up from her spinning, and went and opened the door -- when in walked a large black cat with a white breast, and two white kittens after her. They all made over to the fire and began to warm and dry themselves, purring all the time very loudly; but Judy said never a word, only went on spinning. Then the black cat spoke at last, 'Judy, agrah, don't stay up so late again, for the fairies wanted to hold a council here tonight, and to have some supper, but you have prevented them; so they were very angry and determined to kill you, and only for myself and my two daughters here you would be dead by this time. So take my advice, don't interfere with the fairy hours again, for the night is theirs, and they hate to look on the face of a mortal when they are out for pleasure or business. So I ran on to tell you, and now give me a drink of milk, for I must be off.' And after the milk was finished the cat stood up, and called her daughters to come away. 'Good-night, Judy, agrah,' she said. 'You have been very civil to me, and I'll not forget it to you. Good-night, goodnight.' With that the black cat and the two kittens whisked up the chimney; but Judy looking down saw something glittering on the hearth, and taking it up she found it was a piece of silver, more than she ever could make in a month by her spinning, and she was glad in her heart, and never again sat up so late to interfere with the fairy hours, but the black cat and her daughters came no more again to the house.", "title": "The King of the Cats (Wildecat)", "id": 514}

{"label": "175", "text": "Once upon a time, when Brahmadatta was King of Benares, the Bodhisatta was born as son of his chief queen. On his name-day they asked 800 Brahmans, having satisfied them with all their desires, about his lucky marks. The Brahmans who had skill in divining from such marks beheld the excellence of his, and made answer: 'Full of goodness, great King, is your son, and when you die he will become king; he shall be famous and renowned for his skill with the five weapons, and shall be the chief man in all India.' On hearing what the Brahmans had to say, they gave him the name of the Prince of the Five Weapons, sword, spear, bow, battle-axe, and shield. When he came to years of discretion, and had attained the measure of sixteen years, the King said to him: 'My son, go and complete your education.' 'Who shall be my teacher?' the lad asked. 'Go, my son; in the kingdom of Candahar, in the city of Takkasila, is a far-famed teacher from whom I wish you to learn. Take this, and give it him for a fee.' With that he gave him a thousand pieces of money, and dismissed him. The lad departed, and was educated by this teacher; he received the Five Weapons from him as a gift, bade him farewell, and leaving Takkasila, he began his journey to Benares, armed with the Five Weapons. On his way he came to a forest inhabited by the Demon with the Matted Hair. At the entering in of the forest some men saw him, and cried out: 'Hullo, young sir, keep clear of that wood! There's a Demon in it called he of the Matted Hair. He kills every man he sees!' And they tried to stop him. But the Bodhisatta, having confidence in himself, went straight on, fearless as a maned lion. When he reached mid-forest the Demon showed himself. He made himself as tall as a palm tree; his head was the size of a pagoda, his eyes as big as saucers, and he had two tusks all over knobs and bulbs; he had the face of a hawk, a variegated belly, and blue hands and feet. 'Where are you going?' he shouted. 'Stop! You'll make a meal for me!' Said the Bodhisatta: 'Demon, I came here trusting in myself. I advise you to be careful how you come near me. Here's a poisoned arrow, which I'll shoot at you and knock you down!' With this menace, he fitted to his bow an arrow dipped in deadly poison, and let fly. The arrow stuck fast in the Demon's hair. Then he shot and shot, till he had shot away fifty arrows; and they all stuck in the Demon's hair. The Demon snapped them all off short, and threw them down at his feet; then came up to the Bodhisatta, who drew his sword and struck the Demon, threatening him the while. His sword -- it was three-and-thirty inches long -- stuck in the Demon's hair! The Bodhisatta struck him with his spear that stuck too! He struck him with his club and that stuck too! When the Bodhisatta saw that this had stuck fast, he addressed the Demon. 'You, Demon!'' said he, 'did you never hear of me before the Prince of the Five Weapons? When I came into the forest which you live in I did not trust to my bow and other weapons. This day will I pound you and grind you to powder!' Thus did he declare his resolve, and with, a shout he hit at the Demon with his right hand. It stuck fast in his hair! He hit him with his left hand that stuck too! With his right foot he kicked him that stuck too; then with his left and that stuck too! Then he butted at him with his head, crying, 'I'll pound you to powder!' and his head stuck fast like the rest. Thus the Bodhisatta was five times snared, caught fast in five places, hanging suspended: yet he felt no fear was not even nervous. Thought the Demon to himself: 'Here's a lion of a man! A noble man! More than man is he! Here he is, caught by a Demon like me; yet he will not fear a bit. Since I have ravaged this road, I never saw such a man. Now, why is it that he does not fear?' He was powerless to eat the man, but asked him: 'Why is it, young sir, that you are not frightened to death?' 'Why should I fear, Demon?' replied he. 'In one life a man can die but once. Besides, in my belly is a thunderbolt; if you eat me, you will never be able to digest it; this will tear your inwards into little bits, and kill you: so we shall both perish. That is why I fear nothing.' (By this, the Bodhisatta meant the weapon of knowledge which he had within him.) When he heard this, the Demon thought: 'This young man speaks the truth. A piece of the flesh of such a lion-man as he would be too much for me to digest, if it were no bigger than a kidney-bean. I'll let him go!' So, being frightened to death, he let go the Bodhisatta, saying: 'Young sir, you are a lion of a man! I will not eat you up. I set you free from my hands, as the moon is disgorged from the jaws of Rahu after the eclipse. Go back to the company of your friends and relations!' And the Bodhisatta said: 'Demon, I will go, as you say. You were born a Demon, cruel, blood-bibbing, devourer of the flesh and gore of others, because you did wickedly in former lives. If you still go on doing wickedly, you will go from darkness to darkness. But now that you have seen me you will find it impossible to do wickedly. Taking the life of living creatures causes birth, as an animal, in the world of Petas, or in the body of an Asura, or, if one is reborn as a man, it makes his life short.' With this and the like monition he told him the disadvantage of the five kinds of wickedness, and the profit of the five kinds of virtue, and frightened the Demon in various ways, discoursing to him until he subdued him and made him self-denying, and established him in the five kinds of virtue; he made him worship the deity to whom offerings were made in that wood; and having carefully admonished him, departed out of it. At the entrance of the forest he told all to the people thereabout; and went on to Benares, armed with his five weapons. Afterwards he became king, and ruled righteously; and after giving alms and doing good he passed away according to his deeds. And the Teacher, when this tale was ended, became perfectly enlightened, and repeated this verse: Whose mind and heart from all desire is free, Who seeks for peace by living virtuously, He in due time will sever all the bonds That bind him fast to life, and cease to be. Thus the Teacher reached the summit, through sainthood and the teaching of the law, and thereupon he declared the Four Truths. At the end of the declaring of the Truths, this Brother also attained to sainthood. Then the Teacher made the connection, and gave the key to the birth-tale, saying: 'At that time Angulimala was the Demon, but the Prince of the Five Weapons was I myself.'", "title": "The Demon with the Matted Hair", "id": 516}

{"label": "311", "text": "There was formerly a poor widow, and she had three daughters, and all she had to feed them was a kailyard. There was a great gray horse who was coming every day to the yard to eat the kail. Said the eldest of the daughters to her mother, 'I will go to the yard today, and I will take the spinning-wheel with me, and I will keep the horse out of the kail.' 'Do,' said her mother. She went out. The horse came; she took the distaff from the wheel and she struck him. The distaff stuck to the horse, and her hand stuck to the distaff. Away went the horse till they reached a green hill, and he called out, 'Open, open, oh green hill, and let in the king's son; open, open, oh green hill, and let in the widow's daughter.' The hill opened, and they went in. He warmed water for her feet, and made a soft bed for her limbs, and she lay down that night. Early on the morrow, when he rose, he was going to hunt. He gave her the keys of the whole house, and he said to her that she might open every chamber inside but the one. 'By all she ever saw not to open that one.' That she should have his dinner ready when he should come back, and that if she would be a good woman that he would marry her. When he went away she began to open the chambers. Every one, as she opened it, was getting finer and finer, till she came to the one that was forbidden. It seemed to her, 'What might be in it that she might not open it too.' She opened it, and it was full of dead gentlewomen, and she went down to the knee in blood. Then she came out, and she was cleaning her foot; and though she were cleaning it, still she could not take a bit of the blood off it. A tiny cat came where she was, and she said to her, 'If she would give a little drop of milk that she would clean her foot as well as it was before. 'Thou! Ugly beast! Be off before thee. Dost thou suppose that I won't clean them better than thou?' 'Yes, yes, take thine own way. Thou wilt see what will happen to thee when himself comes home.' He came home, and she set the dinner on the board, and they sat down at it. Before they ate a bit he said to her, 'Wert thou a good woman today?' 'I was,' said she. 'Let me see thy foot, and I will tell thee whether thou wert or wert not.' She let him see the one that was clean. 'Let me see the other one,' said he. When he saw the blood, 'Oh! ho!' said he. He rose and took the axe and took her head off, and he threw her into the chamber with the other dead people. He laid down that night, and early on the morrow he went to the widow's yard again. Said the second one of the widow's daughters to her mother, 'I will go out today, and I will keep the gray horse out of the yard.' She went out sewing. She struck the thing she was sewing on the horse. The cloth stuck to the horse, and her hand stuck to the cloth. They reached the hill. He called as usual to the hill; the hill opened, and they went in. He warmed water for her feet, and made a soft bed for her limbs, and they lay down that night. Early in the morning he was going to hunt, and he said to her that she should open every chamber inside but one, and 'by all she ever saw' not to open that one. She opened every chamber till she came to the little one, and because she thought, 'What might be in that one more than the rest that she might not open it?' She opened it, and it was full of dead gentlewomen, and her own sister amongst them. She went down to the knee in blood. She came out, and she was cleaning herself, and the little cat came round about, and she said to her, 'If thou wilt give me a tiny drop of milk I will clean thy foot as well as it over was.' ' Thou! Ugly beast! Begone. Dost thou think that I will not clean it myself better than thou?' 'Thou wilt see,' said the cat, 'what will happen to thee when himself comes home.' When he came she set down the dinner, and they sat at it. Said he, 'Wert thou a good woman today?' She let him see the foot that was clean. ' Let me see the other one,' said he. She let him see it. 'Oh! ho!' said he, and he took the axe and took her head off. He lay down that night. Early on the morrow, said the youngest one to her mother, as she wove a stocking, 'I will go out with my stocking today, and I will watch the gray horse. I will see what happened to my two sisters, and I will return to tell you.' 'Do,' said her mother, 'and see thou dost not stay away.' She went out, and the horse came. She struck the stocking on the horse. The stocking stuck to the horse, and the band stuck to the stocking. They went away, and they reached the green hill. He called out as usual, and they got in. He warmed water for her feet, and made a soft bed for her limbs, and they lay down that night. On the morrow he was going to hunt, and he said to her, 'If she would behave herself as a good woman till he returned, that they would be married in a few days.' He gave her the keys, and he said to her that she might open every chamber that was within but that little one, 'but see that she should not open that one.' She opened every one, and when she came to this one, because she thought, 'what might be in it that she might not open it more than the rest?' She opened it, and she saw her two sisters there dead, and she went down to the two knees in blood. She came out, and she was cleaning her feet, and she could not take a bit of the blood off them. The tiny cat came where she was, and she said to her, 'Give me a tiny drop of milk, and I will clean thy feet as well as they were before.' 'I will give it, thou creature; I will give thee thy desire of milk if thou will clean my feet' The cat licked her feet as well as they were before. Then the king came home, and they set down his dinner, and they sat at it Before they ate a bit, he said, to her, 'Wert thou a good woman today?' 'I was middling,' said she; I have no boasting to make of myself.' 'Let me see thy feet,' said he. She let him see her feet. 'Thou wert a good woman,' said he; 'and if thou holdest on thus till the end of a few days, thyself and I will be married.' On the morrow he went away to hunt. When he went away the little cat came where she was. 'Now, I will tell thee in what way thou wilt be quickest married to him,' said the cat. 'There are,' said she, 'a lot of old chests within. Thou shall take out three of them; thou shalt clean them. Thou shalt say to him next night, that he must leave these three chests, one about of them, in thy mother's house, as they are of no use here; that there are plenty here without them; thou shalt say to him that he must not open any of them on the road, or else, if he opens, that thou wilt leave him; that thou wilt go up into a tree top, and that thou wilt be looking, and that if he opens any of them that thou wilt see. Then when he goes hunting, thou shalt open the chamber, thou shalt bring out thy two sisters; thou shalt draw on them the magic club, and they will be as lively and whole as they were before; thou shalt clean them then, and thou shall put one in each chest of them, and thou shalt go thyself into the third one. Thou shalt put of silver and of gold, as much in the chests as will keep thy mother and thy sisters right for their lives. When he leaves the chests in thy mother's house, and when he returns he will fly in a wild rage; he will then go to thy mother's house in this fury, and he will break in the door; be thou behind the door, and take off his head with the bar; and then he will be a king's son, as precious as he was before, and he will marry thee. Say to thy sisters, if he attempts the chests to open them by the way, to call out, 'I see thee, I see thee,' and that he will think that thou wilt be calling out in the tree.' When he came home he went away with the chests, one after one, till he left them in her mother's house. When he came to a glen, where he thought she in the tree could not see him, he began to let the chest down to see what was in it; she that was in the chest called out, 'I see thee, I see thee!' ' Good luck be on thy pretty little head,' said he, ' if thou canst not see a long way!' This was the way with him each journey, till he left the chests altogether in her mother's house. When he returned home on the last journey, and saw that she was not before him, he flew in a wild rage; he went back to the widow's house, and when he reached the door he drove it in before him. She was standing behind the door, and she took his head off with the bar. Then he grew a king's son, as precious as ever came; there he was within, and they were in great gladness. She and himself married, and they left with her mother and sisters, of gold and silver, as much as left them well for life.", "title": "The Widow and Her Daughters", "id": 519}

{"label": "670", "text": "In a certain country a king was rearing wild animals. The king had learnt in a thorough manner the speech of animals. One day at that time the fowls were saying, 'Our king assists us very much; he gives us food and drink.' They thanked the king very much. The king having heard their talk, the king laughed with pleasure. The royal queen having been near, asked, 'What did you laugh at?' 'I merely (nikan) laughed,' the king said. Should he explain and give the talk to any person the king will die. Because of it he did not explain and give it. That the king knows the speech of animals he does not inform anyone. The royal queen says, 'There is no one who laughs in that way without a reason. Should you not say the reason I am going away, or having jumped into a well I shall die.' Thereupon the king, because he was unable to be released from [the importunity of] the queen, thought, 'Even if I am to die I must explain and give this.' Thinking thus, he went to give food to the animals. Then it was evident to those animals that this king is going to die. Out of the party of animals first a cock says, 'His majesty our king is going to be lost. We don't want the food. We shall not receive assistance. Unless his majesty the king perish thus we shall not perish. In submission to me there are many hens. When I have called them the hens come. When I have told them to eat they eat. When I have told them to go they go. The king, having become submissive in that manner to the thing that his wife has said, is going to die.' The king having heard it, laughed at it also. Then, also, the royal queen asked, 'What did you laugh at?' Thereupon, not saying the [true] word, the king said, 'Thinking of constructing a tank, I laughed.' Then the queen said, 'Having caused the animals that are in this Lankawa (Ceylon) to be brought, let us build a tank.' Then the king having said, 'It is good,' caused the animals to be brought. The king having gone with the animals, showed them a place [in which] to build a tank; and telling them to build it came away. The animals, at the king's command being unable to do anything, all together began to struggle on the mound of earth. Those which can take earth in the mouth take it in the mouth. All work in this manner. The jackal, not doing work, having bounded away remained looking on. After three or four days, the king having gone [there] trickishly stayed looking on. The king saw that the other animals are all moving about as though working. The jackal, only, having bounded off is looking on. Having seen it he asked the jackal, 'The others are all working. Thou, only, art looking upward. Why?' Thereupon the jackal said, 'No, O lord, I looked into an account.' Then the king asked, 'What account art thou looking at?' The jackal says, 'I looked whether in this country the female3s are in excess or the males are in excess.' The king asked, 'By the account which thou knowest, are the females in excess or the males in excess?' The jackal said, 'So far as I can perceive, the females are in excess in this country.' Then the king said that men are in excess. Having said it the king said, 'I myself having gone home and looked at the books, if males are in excess I shall give thee a good punishment.' The king having come home and looked at the books, it appeared that the males were in excess. Thereupon the king called the jackal, and said, 'Bola, males are in excess.' Then the jackal says, 'No, O lord, your majesty, they are not as many as the females. Having also put down to the female account the males who hearken to the things that females say, after they counted them the females would be in excess.' Then the jackal said, 'Are the animals able to build tanks? How shall they carry the earth?' Thereupon the king having considered it, and having said, 'Wild animals, wild animals, you are to go to the midst of the forest,' came home. At that time, the queen asked, 'Is the tank built and finished?' Then the king, taking a cane, began to beat the queen. Thereupon the queen, having said, 'An\u00c3\u00a9! O lord, your majesty, I will never again say anything, or even ask anything,' began to cry aloud. The king got to know that the jackal was a wise animal.

{"label": "175", "text": "There was a frightful drought. The rivers after a while dried up and even the springs gave no water. The animals wandered around seeking drink, but to no avail. Nowhere was water to be found. A great gathering of animals was held: Lion, Tiger, Wolf, Jackal, Elephant, all of them came together. What was to be done? That was the question. One had this plan, and another had that; but no plan seemed of value. Finally one of them suggested: 'Come, let all of us go to the dry riverbed and dance; in that way we can tread out the water.' Good! Everyone was satisfied and ready to begin instantly, excepting Rabbit, who said, 'I will not go and dance. All of you are mad to attempt to get water from the ground by dancing.' The other animals danced and danced, and ultimately danced the water to the surface. How glad they were. Everyone drank as much as he could, but Rabbit did not dance with them. So it was decided that Rabbit should have no water. He laughed at them: 'I will nevertheless drink some of your water.' That evening he proceeded leisurely to the riverbed where the dance had been, and drank as much as he wanted. The following morning the animals saw the footprints of Rabbit in the ground, and Rabbit shouted to them: 'Aha! I did have some of the water, and it was most refreshing and tasted fine.' Quickly all the animals were called together. What were they to do? How were they to get Rabbit in their hands? All had some means to propose; the one suggested this, and the other that. Finally old Tortoise moved slowly forward, foot by foot: 'I will catch Rabbit.' 'You? How? What do you think of yourself?' shouted the others in unison. 'Rub my shell with pitch [black beeswax], and I will go to the edge of the water and lie down. I will then resemble a stone, so that when Rabbit steps on me his feet will stick fast.' 'Yes! Yes! That's good.' And in a one, two, three, Tortoise's shell was covered with pitch, and foot by foot he moved away to the river. At the edge, close to the water, he lay down and drew his head into his shell. Rabbit during the evening came to get a drink. 'Ha!' he chuckled sarcastically, 'they are, after all, quite decent. Here they have placed a stone, so now I need not unnecessarily wet my feet.' Rabbit trod with his left foot on the stone, and there it stuck. Tortoise then put his head out. 'Ha! old Tortoise! And it's you, is it, that's holding me. But here I still have another foot. I'll give you a good clout.' Rabbit gave Tortoise what he said he would with his right forefoot, hard and straight; and there his foot remained. 'I have yet a hind foot, and with it I'll kick you.' Rabbit drove his hind foot down. This also rested on Tortoise where it struck. 'But still another foot remains, and now I'll tread you.' He stamped his foot down, but it stuck like the others. He used his head to hammer Tortoise, and his tail as a whip, but both met the same fate as his feet, so there he was tight and fast down to the pitch. Tortoise now slowly turned himself round and foot by foot started for the other animals, with Rabbit on his back. 'Ha! ha! ha! Rabbit! How does it look now? Insolence does not pay after all,' shouted the animals. Now advice was sought. What should they do with Rabbit? He certainly must die. But how? One said, 'Behead him'; another, 'Some severe penalty.' 'Rabbit, how are we to kill you?' 'It does not affect me,' Rabbit said. 'Only a shameful death please do not pronounce.' 'And what is that?' they all shouted. 'To take me by my tail and dash my head against a stone; that I pray and beseech you don't do.' 'No, but just so you'll die. That is decided.' It was decided Rabbit should die by taking him by his tail and dashing his head to pieces against some stone. But who is to do it? Lion, because he is the most powerful one. Good! Lion should do it. He stood up, walked to the front, and poor Rabbit was brought to him. Rabbit pleaded and beseeched that he couldn't die such a miserable death. Lion took Rabbit firmly by the tail and swung him around. The white skin slipped off from Rabbit, and there Lion stood with the white bit of skin and hair in his paw. Rabbit was free.", "title": "The Dance for Water; or, Rabbit's Triumph", "id": 522}
{"label": "1696", "text": "A certain man died and left three sons. One was altogether a fool, another was fairly intelligent, and the third was rather clever. This being so, it was of course difficult for them to live together. In dividing the inheritance among them, the fool was cheated, and in regard to the cattle he was thus duped: There were three entrances to the pen, two open and one very narrow. The two clever brothers proposed to drive the beasts out of all three at once; those that issued from the small gap were to belong to the fool. In this way the latter's share was only one young bull out of the whole flock. But to his feeble mind the division seemed fair enough, so he contentedly drove his bull out into the forest, and tied it with a stout rope to a young tree, whilst he himself wandered aimlessly about.  Three days later, the fool went to see his beast. It had eaten and drunk nothing, but had pulled the tree up by the roots, and laid bare a jar full of old gold coins. The fool was delighted, and played with the money for a time. Then he resolved to take the jar and present it to the king. As he passed along the road, every wayfarer looked into the pot, took out the gold in handfuls, and so that he should not notice their thefts, filled it up with stones and blocks of wood. On reaching the palace, the fool asked for an audience of the king, and it was granted. He emptied out the contents of the jar at the feet of the king. When the courtiers saw the wrath of the king, they took the fool away and beat him. When he had recovered himself he asked why he had been thrashed. One of the bystanders, for fun, cried to him, 'You have been beaten because you labor in vain.'  The fool went his way, muttering the words, 'You labor in vain.' As he passed a peasant who was reaping, he repeated his phrase again and again, until the peasant grew angry, and thrashed him. The fool asked why he had been beaten, and what he ought to have said.  'You ought to have said, 'God give you a good harvest!''  The fool went on, saying 'God give you a good harvest!' and met a funeral. Again he was beaten, and again he asked what he should say.  They replied that he should have said, 'Heaven rest your soul!' He then came to a wedding, and saluted the newly married couple with this funereal phrase.  Again he was beaten, and then told that he should say, 'Be fruitful and multiply!'  His next visit was to a monastery, and he accosted every monk with his new salutation. They too gave him a thrashing, with such vigor that the fool determined to have his revenge by stealing of the bells from their belfry. So he hid himself until the monks had gone to rest, and then carried off a bell of moderate size.  He went into the forest, climbed a tree, and hung the bell on the branches, ringing it from time to time, partly to amuse himself and partly to frighten away wild beasts. In the forest there was a gang of robbers, who were assembled to share their booty, and had just ended a merry banquet. Suddenly they heard the sound of the bell, and were much afraid. They took counsel as to what was to be done, and most of them were for flight, but the oldest of the band advised them to send a scout to see what was wrong. The bravest among them was sent to get information, and the rest remained as quiet as possible.  The brigand went on tiptoe through the bushes to the tree where the fool was, and respectfully asked, 'Who are you? If you are an angel sent by God to punish our wickedness, pray spare us and we shall repent. If you are a devil from hell, come and share with us.'  The fool was not so stupid that he did not see he had to deal with robbers, so he took out a knife, tolled the bell, and then said with a grave air, 'If you wish to know who I am, climb the tree and show me your tongue, so that I may mark on it who I am and what I ask of you.'  The robber obediently climbed the tree, and put out his tongue as far as he could. The fool cut off his tongue, and kicked him to the ground. The robber, mad with pain, and frightened by his sudden fall, ran off howling. His comrades had come out to meet him, and when they saw the plight he was in, they ran off in terror, leaving their wealth. Next morning the fool found the booty, and without saying anything to anybody, took it home and became much richer than his brothers. The fool built three palaces: one for himself, one for me, and one for you. There is merrymaking in the fool's palace. Come and be one of the guests!", "title": "The Fool's Good Fortune", "id": 523}
{"label": "1586", "text": "Seven men of Buneyr once left their native wilds for the purpose of seeking their fortunes. When evening came they all sat down under a tree to rest, when one of them said, 'Let us count to see if we are all here.' So he counted, 'One, two, three, four, five, six,' but, quite omitting to reckon himself, he exclaimed, 'There's one of us missing, we are only six!' 'Nonsense!' cried the others, and the whole company of seven began counting with uplifted forefingers, but they all forgot to count themselves. Fearing some evil, they now rose up, and at once set out to search for their missing comrade. Presently they met a shepherd, who greeted them civilly and said, 'Friends, why are you in such low spirits?' 'We have lost one of our party,' answered they; 'we started this morning seven in number, and now we are only six. Have you seen any one of us hereabouts?' 'But,' said the shepherd, 'seven you are, for I have found your lost companion; behold: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven!' 'Ah,' answered the wise men of Buneyr, 'you have indeed found our missing brother. We owe you a debt of gratitude. Because you have done us this service, we insist on doing a month's free labor for you.' So the shepherd, overjoyed with his good fortune, took the men home with him. Now, the shepherd's mother was a very old woman, in her dotage, utterly feeble and unable to help herself. When the morning came he placed her under the care of one of the Buneyris, saying to him, 'You will stay here and take care of my old mother.' To another Buneyri he said, 'You take out my goats, graze them on the hills by day, and watch over them by night.' To the other five he said, 'As for you, I shall have work for you tomorrow.' The man who was left in charge of the old crippled mother found that his time was fully occupied in the constant endeavor to drive off the innumerable flies which in that hot season kept her in a state of continual excitement and irritation. When, however, he saw that all his efforts were fruitless, and that he flapped the wretches away in vain, he became desperate, and, lifting up a large stone, he aimed it deliberately at a certain fly which had settled on the woman's face. Hurling it with all his might, he of course missed the fly, but, alas! he knocked the woman prone on her back. When the shepherd saw this he wrung his hands in despair. 'Ah,' cried he, 'what has your stupidity done for me? The fly has escaped, but as for my poor old mother, you have killed her dead.' Meanwhile, the second Buneyri led his flock of goats up and down among the hills, and when midday came he rested to eat his bread, while many of the assembled goats lay down beside him. As he was eating he began to observe how the goats were chewing the cud and occasionally looking at him So he foolishly imagined that they were mocking him, and waxed wroth. 'So,' cried he, 'because I am taking my food, you must needs crowd round and make game of me, must you?' And, seizing his hatchet, he made a sudden rush at the poor animals, and he had already struck off the heads of several of them, when the shepherd came running to the spot, bemoaning his bad luck and crying to the fellow to desist from slaughter. That night was a sorrowful one for the trustful shepherd, and bitterly he repented his rashness. In the morning the remaining five wise men of Buneyr came to him, and said, 'It is now our turn. Give us some work to do, too!' 'No, no, my friends,' answered he; 'you have amply repaid me for the trifling favor I did for you in finding your missing companion; and now, for God's sake, go your way and let me see you no more.'

She watered them every day until she saw thousands of little children's heads appearing above the ground. The next day little boys, at most half an inch tall, were running around. The peasant woman was embarrassed. She decided to go see a fairy, her godmother, to ask for her advice. The fairy took all the children except one and turned them into elves who flew off in all directions. This is why there are so many goblins, gremlins, sprites, and imps. They are jealous of not being human and thus have no greater pleasure than to mislead travelers and play all kinds of tricks on them. The little child kept was called Jean des Pois Verts [Jean of the Green Peas]. He always remained very small. The fairy presented him with a carriage and magnificent clothes. The carriage was made of a ladybug wing; the horses were two dragonflies; the driver, a little wasp; and the footmen, two black ants. His dress coat was a spider's web, and his garters were two strands of gossamer. He was living happily with his mother when thieves attacked the house. They were about to kill him when their chief stopped them, telling them that he would be useful to them in a burglary that he was planning. They let Jean live, but he was taken prisoner. The brigands then went to plunder a church. The door was locked. Jean was forced to enter through the keyhole and pull back the bolts. The bandits grabbed the gold and precious items and fled into the countryside. Jean des Pois Verts was placed in the chief's pocket, who did not worry about him any longer. The child sneaked out, hid in the undergrowth, and kept his eye on the thieves. He watched them deposit their loot in a cave, and then set out again for a new expedition. Jean des Pois Verts entered the cave and carried away all the riches. Before long he arrived at his house. His mother opened the door and received her son with joy. They were now rich and and led happy lives. When Jean des Pois Verts died, the fairy carried him to heaven on a thistle blossom.", "title": "Jean des Pois Verts", "id": 526}
{"label": "1191", "text": "In Lake Galenbeck (in the vicinity of Friedland) there is a tongue of land, probably artificial, that stretches about to the middle of the lake. It is called the devil's bridge, and is said to be the remains of a bridge started, but never completed, by the devil. A shepherd had to drive his herd completely around the lake in order to reach his pasture. This annoyed him, and one day he wished with a curse that a bridge went across the lake. He had scarcely uttered this wish when a man appeared before him. The man promised to build a bridge in one night, before the rooster crowed three times, under the condition that the shepherd would then belong to him. The shepherd entered into this agreement. That evening when he arrived home, he told his wife what had happened. She said nothing, but at midnight she went to the chicken coop and awakened the rooster, who thought that it was already morning, and crowed three times. The devil heard this. He was not finished with his work, and angrily flew off through the air without completing the bridge.", "title": "The Devil's Bridge in Lake Galenbeck", "id": 527}
{"label": "155", "text": "A camel driver, crossing the plains, stopped to rest where a caravan had halted and built a fire the night before; in the morning they had moved on before it had died out. As the night wind arose, it fanned the sparks and soon set all the brushwood around on fire. In the midst of the brushwood lay coiled an adder, fast asleep. The flames, however, soon awoke him, but not until he was completely encircled by the fire. He was about to despair of his life, when he saw the camel driver and called upon him for aid. At first the camel driver hesitated, for he remembered the poisonous sting of the adder. Still, he could not bear to see any living creature suffer, so he promised to help the adder. He had a bag beneath his saddle. This he now drew forth and tied to the end of his spear. He then reached it over into the midst of the burning brush; the adder crawled inside, and the camel driver drew him safely out of the fire. 'Now go your way,' said the camel driver, loosening the neck of the bag so that the adder could glide out. 'Only remember the kindness which I have shown to you, and do you hereafter be kind to men in your turn.' 'I confess,' replied the adder, slipping out on the ground, 'that you have been kind to me, and yet I shall not go away until I have stung both you and your camel. I only leave it to you to decide whether I shall sting you first or the camel.' 'What a monster of ingratitude you are!' cried the camel driver. 'Is it right to return evil for good?' Such is the custom of men,' said the adder. 'You are not only ungrateful, but untruthful as well,' the camel driver made reply. 'It would be hard indeed for you to prove these words of yours. There is no other creature in the world, I venture to say, who will agree with you. If you can find out one other, I will allow you to sting me.' 'Very well,' responded the adder; 'let us put the question to yonder cow.' The cow stopped chewing her cud. 'If you mean what is man's custom,' she began, in answer to their question, 'I must answer to my sorrow that he is wont to repay evil for good. For many years I have been the faithful servant of a farmer. Every day I have supplied him with milk to drink and rich cream for his butter. Now I am old and no longer able to serve him. So he has put me out in this pasture that I may grow fat, and only yesterday he brought the butcher to see me. Tomorrow I am to be sold for beef. Surely this is repaying my kindness with evil.' 'You see,' said the adder to the camel driver, 'that what I said is true. Get ready for me to sting you. Shall it be you or the camel first?' 'Hold,' replied the camel driver. 'In court a decree is not passed without the testimony of two witnesses. Bring another witness, and if he agrees with the cow, you may do with me as you please.' The adder looked about him and saw that they were standing beneath a huge palm tree. 'Let us put the question to the tree,' he said. When the palm had heard their question, he shook his great branches sadly. 'Experience has taught me,' he moaned, 'that for every favor you do to men, you must expect some injury in return. I stand here in the desert, doing harm to none and good to many. Every traveler who comes by can rest beneath my shade. I bear dates for his refreshment, and gladly give my sap to quench his thirst. Yet when the traveler has eaten and slept beneath my shade, he looks up into my branches and says to himself, 'That branch would make me a good cane, or handle for my ax,' or 'What splendid wood there is in this tree! I must cut off a limb to make some new doors for my house.' And I must consent to this without a murmur. Thus is my kindness returned by men.' 'The two witnesses have now testified,' spoke the adder, 'and agree. Which shall I bite first, you or the camel?' But just at that moment a fox ran by, and the camel driver pleaded that they might hear one more testimony. The adder was so pleased with what the cow and the tree had said, that he readily agreed to listen to the fox. When the camel driver had finished telling the whole tale to the fox, the fox laughed out loud. 'You seem to be a clever fellow,' he replied to the camel driver. 'Why do you tell me such a falsehood?' 'Indeed, he is telling you nothing but the truth,' the adder hastened to assure the fox. Again the fox laughed outright. 'Do you mean to tell me,' he asked scornfully, 'that such a large adder as you could possibly get into such a small bag?' 'If you do not believe it, I will crawl in again and show you,' answered the adder. 'Well,' responded the fox, thoughtfully, 'if I see you in there with my own eyes, then I will consent to give my answer to your question.' The camel driver straightway held the bag open, and the adder crept in and coiled up in the bottom. 'Be quick now,' cried the fox, 'and draw the string.

{"label": "737", "text": "Editor's Note (DLA) In twenty-eight rhymed stanzas Rober Burns describes how 'some merry, friendly, countra folks' convened on Halloween to perform various traditional rituals, with the hope of thus conjuring up images of their future marriage partners. Each ritual, described in Scottish dialect, is elucidated with an explanatory footnote. Foreword The following POEM will, by many Readers, be well enough understood; but, for the sake of those who are unacquainted with the manners and traditions of the country where the scene is cast, Notes are added, to give some account of the principal Charms and Spells of that Night, so big with Prophecy to the Peasantry in the West of Scotland. The passion of prying into Futurity makes a striking part of the history of Human-nature, in it's rude ftate, in all ages and nations; and it may be some entertainment to a philosophic mind, if any such should honor the Author with a perusal, to see the remains of it, among the more unenlightened in our own. Preface Yes! Let the Rich deride, the Proud disdain, The simple pleasures of the lowly train; To me more dear, congenial to my heart, One native charm, than all the gloss of art. GOLDSMITH Note to the Title 'Halloween' Is thought to be a night when Witches, Devils, and other mischief making beings, are all abroad on their baneful, midnight errands: particularly, those aerial people, the Fairies, are said, on that night, to hold a grand Anniversary. Note to Stanza 4 The first ceremony of Halloween, is, pulling each a Stock or plant of kail. They must go out, hand in hand, with eyes shut, and pull the first they meet with: its being big or little, straight or crooked, is prophetic of the size and shape of the grand object of all their Spells -- the husband or wife. If any yird, or earth, stick to the root, that is tocher, or fortune; and the taste of the cufloc, that is, the heart of the stem, is indicative of the natural temper and disposition. Lastly, the stems, or to give them their ordinary appellation, the runts, are placed somewhere above the head of the door; and the christian names of the people whom chance brings into the house, are, according to the priority of placing the runts, the names in question. Note to Stanza 6 They go to the barn-yard, and pull each, at three several times, a stalk of Oats. If the third stalk wants the top-pickle, that is, the grain at the top of the stalk, the party in question will want the Maidenhead. Note to Stanza 7 Burning the nuts is a favourite charm. They name the lad and lass to each particular nut, as they lay them in the fire; and according as they burn quietly together, or start from beside one another, the course and issue of the Courtship will be. Note to Stanza 11 Whoever would, with success, try this spell, must strcitly observe these directions. Steal out, all alone, to the kiln, and, darkling, throw into the pot, a clew of blue yarn; wind it in a new clew off the old one; and towards the latter end, something will hold the thread: demand, wha hands? i. e. who holds? and answer will be returned from the kiln pot, by naming the christian and sirname of your future Spouse. Note to Stanza 13 Take a candle, and go, alone, to a looking glass: eat an apple before it, and some traditions say you should comb your hair all the time: the face of your conjugal companion, to be, will be seen in the glass, as if peeping over your shoulder. Note to Stanza 16 Steal out, unperceived, and sow a handful of hemp seed; harrowing it with any thing you can conveniently draw after you. Repeat, now and then, 'Hemp seed I saw thee, Hemp seed I saw thee; and him (or her) that is to be my true love, I come after me and pou thee.' Look over your left shoulder, and you will see the appearance of the person invoked, in the attitude of pulling hemp. Some traditions say, 'come after me and shaw thee,' that is, show thyself; in which case it simply appears. Others omit the harrowing, and say, 'come after me and harrow thee.' Note to Stanza 21 This charm must likewise be performed, unperceived and alone. You go to the barn, and open both doors; taking them off the hinges, if possible; for there is danger, that the Being, about to appear, may shut the doors, and do you some mischief. Then take that inftrument used in winnowing the corn, which, in our country dialect, we call a wecht; and go thro' all the attitudes of letting down corn against the wind. Repeat it three times; and the third time, an apparition will pass thro' the barn, in at the windy door, and out at the other, having both the figure in question and the appearance or retinue, marking the employment or station in life. Note to Stanza 23 Take an opportunity of going, unnoticed, to a Bear-stack, and fathom it three times round. The last fathom of the last time, you will catch in your arms, the appearance of your future conjugal yoke-fellow. Note to Stanza 24 You go out, one or more, for this is a social spell, to a south-running spring or rivulet, where 'three Lairds' lands meet,' and dip your left shirt-sleeve. Go to bed in sight of a fire, and hang your wet sleeve before it to dry. Ly awake; and sometime near midnight, an apparition, having the exact figure of the grand object in question, will come and turn the sleeve, as if to dry the other side of it. Note to Stanza 27 Take three dishes; put clean water in one, foul water in another, and leave the third empty: blindfold a person, and lead him to the hearth where the dishes are ranged; he (or she) dips the left hand: if by chance in the clean water, the future husband or wife will come to the bar of Matrimony, a Maid; if in the foul, a widow; if in the empty dish, it foretells, with equal certainty, no marriage at all. It is repeated three times; and every time the arrangement of the dishes is aliered.", "title": "Halloween", "id": 529}

When he was four years he could go into a thimble, and when he was six he was no bigger than a daisy. His poor parents did not know what to do with him. They used to say, 'Poor Tom Thumb.' At last a kind giant who lived a long way off got to hear of Tom Thumb. The giant was so tall that he hid the light of the sun, and whenever he passed by, the people thought the night had come. The big giant said 'Come along Tom, you will soon be as big as your father.' He caught poor Tom up, put him sitting on his ear and carried him off. Tom stayed with the giant for twelve years and lived on giant's food. By this time he was as big as his father but by far stronger. The giant's food had given him a giant's strength. 'You may go off now,' said the giant at the end of twelve years. 'You are as big as your father and as strong as myself. You may go off now and seek your fortune.' Tom's father or mother did not know him when he came back, and he did not tell them who he was. The two old people were living together in a tiny little house, and they were as poor as could be. Their farm had been taken from them by a cruel blacksmith. When Tom Thumb heard this he went to the blacksmith and asked for work. 'What wages do you want?' said the smith. 'I want no wages at all,' said Tom. 'All I want is that you let me give you a few taps on the shoulder every evening.' 'You can do that,' said the smith. So Tom started to work. The first blow he struck broke the anvil into many pieces, and the second knocked the roof off the forge. 'Stop,' said the smith, 'you'll work here no longer.' 'I'll have my day's wages then,' said Tom. He struck the blacksmith a blow on the shoulder and put him over a cock of hay. 'That's one half of my wages paid,' said Tom. 'Shall I take the other half?' 'Don't strike me again,' said the smith. I'll give you anything you ask if you leave me alone,' said the smith. 'All right,' said Tom Thumb. 'Give me my father's farm and a purse of gold.' Tom got the gold and build a big house for his father and mother. They lived comfortably again as long as they lived. Informant: M\u00c3\u00a1ire N\u00c3\u00ad Chuinneag\u00c3\u00a1in Age: 21.

{"label": "113A", "text": "And who was Johnny Reed? And what was there remarkable about his cat? Have you never heard tell of Johnny Reed's cat? It's an old tale they have in the north country, and it's true enough, though folk may not believe it in these days when the Bible's not gospel enough for some of them. I've heard my father often tell the story, and he came from Newcastle way, which is the very part where Johnny Reed used to live, being a parish sexton in a village not far away. Well, Johnny Reed was the sexton, as I've already said, and he and his wife kept a cat, a well enough behaved creature, sure enough, and a beast as he had no fault to set on, saving a few of the tricks which all cats play at times, and which seem born in the blood of the creatures. It was all black except one white paw, and seemed as honest and decent a beast as could be, and Tom would as soon have suspected it of being any more than it really seemed to be as he would one of his own children themselves, like many other folk, perhaps, who, may be, have cats of the same kind, little thinking it. Well, the cat had been with him some years when a strange thing occurred. One night Johnny was going home late from the churchyard, where he had been digging a grave for a person who had died on a sudden, throwing the grave on Johnny's hands unexpectedly, so that he had to stop working at it by the light of a lantern to have it ready for the next day's burying. Well, having finished his work, and having put his tools in the shed in a corner of the yard, and having locked them up safe, he began to walk home pretty brisk, thinking would his wife be up and have a bit of fire for him, for the night was cold, a keen wind blowing over the fields. He hadn't gone far before he comes to a gate at the roadside, and there seemed to be a strange shadow about it, in which Johnny saw, as it might be, a lot of little gleaming fires dancing about, while some stood steady, just like flashes of light from little windows in buildings all on fire inside. Says Johnny to himself, for he was not a man to be easily frightened, being accustomed by his calling to face things which might upset other folk, ''Hullo! What's here? Here's a thing I never saw before.' And with that he walks straight up to the gate, while the shadow got deeper and the fires brighter the nearer he came to it. Well, when he came right up to the gate he finds that the shadow was just none at all, but nine black cats, some sitting and some dancing about, and the lights were the flashes from their eyes. When he came nearer he thought to scare them off, and he calls out, 'Sh -- sh -- sh,' but never a cat stirs for all of it. 'I'll soon scatter you, you ugly varmin,' says Johnny, looking about him for a stone, which was not to be found, the night being dark and preventing him seeing one. Just then he hears a voice calling, ''Johnny Reed!' 'Hullo!' says he, 'Who's that wants me?' 'Johnny Reed,' says the voice again. 'Well,' says Johnny, 'I'm here,' and looking round and seeing no one, for no one was about 'tis true. 'Was it one of you,' says he, joking like, to the cats, 'as was calling me?' 'Yes, of course,' answers one of them, as plain as ever Christian spoke. 'It's me as has called you these three times.' Well, with that, you may be sure, Johnny begins to feel curious, for 'twas the first time he had ever been spoken to by a cat, and he didn't know what it might lead to exactly. So he takes off his hat to the cat, thinking that it was, perhaps, best to show it respect, and, seeing that he was unable to guess with whom he was dealing, hoping to come off all the better for a little civility. 'Well, sir,' says he, 'what can I do for you?' 'It's not much as I want with you,' says the cat, 'but it's better it'll be with you if you do what I tell you. Tell Dan Ratcliffe that Peggy Poyson's dead.' 'I will, sir,' says Johnny, wondering at the same time how he was to do it, for who Dan Ratcliffe was he knew no more than the dead. Well, with that all the cats vanished, and Johnny, running the rest of the way home, rushes into his house, smoking hot from the fright and the distance he had to go over. 'Nan,' says he to his wife, the first words he spoke, 'who's Dan Ratcliffe?' 'Dan Ratcliffe,' says she. 'I never heard of him, and don't know there's any one such living about here.' 'No more do I,' says he, ''but I must find him wherever he is.' Then he tells his wife all about how he had met the cats, and how they had stopped him and given him the message. Well, his cat sits there in front of the fire looking as snug and comfortable as a cat could be, and nearly half asleep, but when Johnny comes to telling his wife the message the cats had given him, then it jumped up on its feet, and looks at Johnny, and says, 'What! Is Peggy Poyson dead? Then it's no time for me to be here.' And with that it springs through the door and vanishes, nor was ever seen again from that day to this. 'And did the sexton ever find Dan Ratcliffe,' I asked. Never. He searched high and low for him about, but no one could tell him of such a person, though Johnny looked long enough, thinking it might be the worse for him if he didn't do his best to please the cats. At last, however, he gave the matter up. Then, what was the meaning of the cat's message? It's hard to tell; but many folk thought, and I'm inclined to agree with them, that Dan Ratcliffe was Johnny's own cat, and no one else, looking at the way he acted, and no other of the name being known. Who Peggy Poyson was no one could tell, but likely enough it was some relative of the cat, or may be someone it was interested in, for it's little we know concerning the creatures and their ways, and with whom and what they're mixed up.", "title": "Johnny Reed's Cat", "id": 531}
{"label": "502", "text": "Guerrino, only son of Filippomaria, King of Sicily, sets free from his father's prison a certain savage man. His mother, through fear of the king, drives her son into exile, and him the savage man, now humanized, delivers from many and measureless ills. I have heard by report, and likewise gathered from my own experience, most gracious and pleasure-loving ladies, that a kindly service done to another (although at the time the one served may seem in no sense grateful for the boon conferred) will more often than not come back to the doer thereof with abundant usury of benefit. Which thing happened to the son of a king who, having liberated from one of his father's prisons a wild man of the woods, was more than once rescued from a violent death by the captive he had freed. This you will easily understand from the fable which I intend to relate to you, and for the love I bear to all of you I will exhort you never to be backward in aiding others; because, even though you be not repaid by those in whose behalf you have wrought, God himself, the rewarder of all, will assuredly never leave your good deed unrecompensed; nay, on the contrary, he will make you partakers with him of his divine grace. Sicily, my dear ladies (as must be well known to all of you), is an island very fertile and complete in itself, and in antiquity surpassing all the others of which we have knowledge, abounding in towns and villages which render it still more beautiful. In past times the lord of this island was a certain king named Filippomaria, a man wise and amiable and of rare virtue, who had to wife a courteous, winsome, and lovely lady, the mother of his only son, who was called Guerrino. The king took greater delight in following the chase than any other man in the country, and, for the reason that he was of a strong and robust habit of body, this diversion was well suited to him. Now it happened one day that, as he was coming back from hunting in company with divers of his barons and huntsmen, he saw, coming out of a thick wood a wild man, tall and big and so deformed and ugly that they all looked upon him with amazement. In strength of body he seemed no whit inferior to any of them; wherefore the king, having put himself in fighting trim, together with two of the most valiant of his barons, attacked him boldly, and after a long and doughty struggle overcame him and took him a prisoner with his own hands. Then, having bound him, they conveyed him back to the palace, and selected for him a safe lodging, fitted for the purpose, into which they cast him, and there under strong locks he was kept by the king's command closely confined and guarded. And seeing that the king set high store upon his captive, he ordained that the keys of the prison should be held in charge by the queen, and never a day passed when he would not for pastime go to visit him. Before many days had gone by the king once more put himself in array for the chase, and, having furnished himself with all the various things which are necessary thereto, he set forth with a gallant company of courtiers, but before he left he gave into the queen's care the keys of the prison. And during the time that the king was absent on his hunting a great longing came over Guerrino, who was at that season a young lad, to see the wild man of the woods; so having betaken himself all alone, carrying his bow, in which he delighted greatly, to the prison grating, the creature saw him and straight way began to converse with him in decent orderly fashion. And while they talked the boy, dexterously snatched out of his hand the arrow, which was richly ornamented. Whereupon the boy began to weep, and could not keep back his tears, crying out that the savage ought to give him back his arrow. But the wild man said to him: 'If you will open the door and let me go free from this prison I will give you back your arrow, but if you refuse I will not let you have it.' The boy answered, 'How would you that I should open the door for you and set you free, seeing that I have not the means therefor.' Then said the wild man, 'If indeed you were in the mood to release me and to let me out of this narrow cell, I would soon teach you the way in which it might be done.' 'But how?' replied Guerrino; 'tell me the way.' To which the wild man made answer: 'Go to the chamber of the queen your mother, and when you see that she is taking her midday sleep, put your hand softly under the pillow upon which she is resting, and take therefrom the keys of the prison in such wise that she shall not notice the theft, and bring them here and open my prison door. When you shall have done this I will give you back your arrow forthwith, and peradventure at some future time I may be able to make you a return for your kindness.' Guerrino, wishing beyond everything to get back his gilded dart, did everything that the wild man had told him, and found the keys exactly as he had said, and with these in his hand he returned to the prison, and said to him: 'Behold! Here are the keys; but if I let you out of this place you must go so far from hence that not even the scent of you may be known, for if my father, who is a great huntsman, should find you and capture you again, he would of a surety kill you out of hand.' 'Let not that trouble you, my child,' said the captive, 'for as soon as ever you shall open the prison and see me a free man, I will give you back your arrow and will get me away into such distant parts that neither your father nor any other man shall ever find me.' Guerrino, who had all the strength of a man, worked away at the door, and finally threw open the prison, when the wild man, having given back to him his arrow and thanked him heartily, went his way. Now this wild man had been formerly a very handsome youth, who, through despair at his inability to win the favour of the lady he ardently loved, let go all dreams of love and urbane pursuits, and took up his dwelling amongst beasts of the forest, abiding always in the gloomy woods and bosky thickets, eating grass and drinking water after the fashion of a brute. On this account the wretched man had become covered with a great fell of hair; his skin was hard, his beard thick and tangled and very long, and, through eating herbs and grass, his beard, his hairy covering, and the hair of his head had become so green that they were quite monstrous to behold. As soon as ever the queen awoke from her slumbers she thrust her hand under her pillow to seek for the keys she had put there, and, when she found they were gone, she was terrified amain, and having turned the bed upside down without meeting with any trace of them, she ran straightway like one bereft of wit to the prison, which was standing open. When on searching further she found no sign of the wild man, she was so sore stricken with grief and fear that she was like to die, and, having returned to the palace, she made diligent search in every corner thereof, questioning the while now this courtier and now that as to who the presumptuous and insolent varlet was who had been brazen enough to lay hands upon the keys of the prison without her knowledge. To this questioning they one and all declared that they knew nought of the matter which thus disturbed her. And when Guerrino met his mother, and remarked that she was almost beside herself in a fit of passion, he said to her: 'Mother see that you cast no blame on any of these in respect to the opening of the prison door, because if punishment is due to any thereanent it is due to me, for I, and I alone, unlocked it.' The queen, when she heard these words, was plunged in deeper sorrow than ever, fearing lest the king, when he should come back from his hunting, might kill his son through sheer anger at the fault he had committed, seeing that he had given into her charge the keys, to guard them as preciously as her own person. Wherefore the queen in her desire to escape the consequences of a venial mistake fell into another error far more weighty, for without the shortest delay she summoned two of her most trusty servants, and her son as well, and, having given to them a great quantity of jewels and much money and divers fine horses, sent him forth to seek his fortune, at the same time begging the servants most earnestly to take the greatest care of Guerrino. A very short time after son had departed from the presence of his mother, the king came back to the palace from following the chase, and as soon as he had alighted from his horse he betook himself straightway to the prison to go and see the wild man, and when he found the door wide open and the captive gone, and no trace of him left behind, he was forthwith inflamed with such violent anger that he determined in his mind to cause to be slain without fail the person who had wrought such a flagrant misdeed. And, having sought out the queen, who was sitting overcome with grief in her chamber, he commanded her to tell him what might be the name of the impudent, rash, and presumptuous varlet who had been bold enough of heart to open the doors of the prison and thereby give opportunity to the wild man of the woods to make his escape. Whereupon the queen, in a meek and trembling voice, made answer to him: 'O sire! be not troubled on account of this thing, for Guerrino our son (as he himself has made confession to me) admits that he has done this.' And then she told to the king everything that Guerrino had said to her, and he, when he heard her story, was greatly incensed with rage. Next she told him that, on account of the fear she felt lest he should slay his son, she had sent the youth away into a far distant country, accompanied by two of their most faithful servants, and carrying with him rich store of jewels and of money sufficient to serve their needs. The king, when he listened to this speech of the queen, felt one sorrow heaping itself upon another, and he came within an ace of falling to the ground or of losing his wits, and, if it had not been for the courtiers who fell upon him and held him back, he would assuredly have slain his unhappy queen on the spot. Now when the poor king had in some measure recovered his composure and calmed the fit of unbridled rage which had possessed him, he said to the queen: 'Alas, my wife! What fancy was this of yours which induced you to send away into some unknown land our son, the fruit of our mutual love? Is it possible that you imagined I should hold this wild man of greater value than one who was my own flesh and blood?' And without awaiting any reply to these remarks of his, he bade a great troop of soldiers mount their horses forthwith, and, after having divided themselves into four companies, to make a close search and endeavour to find the prince. But all their inquest was in vain, seeing that Guerrino and his attendants had made their journey secretly, and had let no one know who they might be. Guerrino, after he had ridden far and traversed divers valleys and mountains and rivers, making a halt now in one spot and now in another, attained at last his sixteenth year, and so fair a youth was he by this time that he resembled nothing so much as a fresh morning rose. But after a short time had passed, the servants who accompanied him were seized with the devilish thought of killing him, and then taking the store of jewels and money and parting it amongst themselves. This wicked plot, however, came to nought, because by the working of divine justice they were not able to agree amongst themselves. For by good fortune it happened that, one day while they were devising this wickedness, there rode by a very fair and graceful youth, mounted upon a superb steed, and accoutred with the utmost magnificence. This youth bowed and graciously saluted Guerrino, and thus addressed him: 'Most gracious sir, if it should not prove distasteful to you, I would fain make my journey in your company.' And to this Guerrino replied: 'Your courtesy in making your request will not permit me to refuse it and the pleasure of your company. Therefore I give you cordial thanks, and I beg you as a special favour that you will accompany us on our road. We are strangers in this country and know but little of its highways, and you may be able of your kindness to direct our paths therein. Moreover, as we ride on together we can discuss the various chances which have befallen us, and thus our journey will be less irksome.' Now this young man was no other than the wild man whom Guerrino had set free from the prison of King Filippomaria his father. This youth, after wandering through various countries and strange lands, met one day by chance a very lovely and benignant fairy, who was at that time suffering from a certain distemper. She, when she looked upon him and saw how misshapen and hideous he was, laughed so violently at the sight of his ugliness that she caused to burst an imposthume which had formed in the vicinity of her heart -- an ailment which might well have caused her death by suffocation. And at that very moment she was delivered from all pain and trouble of this infirmity, as if she had never been afflicted therewith in the past, and restored to health. Wherefore the good fairy, in recompense for so great a favour done to her, said to him, not wishing to appear ungrateful to him: 'O thou creature, who art now so deformed and filthy, since thou hast been the means of restoring to me my health which I so greatly de sired, go thy ways, and be thou changed from what thou art into the fairest, the wisest, and the most graceful youth that may anywhere be found. And, besides this, I make you the sharer with me of all the power and authority conferred upon me by nature, whereby you will be able to do and to undo whatsoever you will according to your desire.' And having presented to him a noble horse endowed with magic powers, she gave him leave to go whithersoever he would. Thus as Guerrino journeyed along with the young man, knowing nothing as to who he might be, but well known of him the while, they came at last to a mighty and strong city called Irlanda, over which at that time ruled King Zifroi. This King Zifroi was the father of two daughters, graceful to look upon, of modest manners, and in beauty surpassing Venus herself, one of them named Potentiana and the other Eleuteria. They were held so dear by the king their father, that he could see by no other eyes than theirs. As soon as Guerrino entered the city of Irlanda with the unknown youth and with his train of servants, he hired a lodging of a certain householder who was the wittiest fellow in the whole of Irlanda, and who treated his guests with cheer of the best. And on the day following, the unknown youth made believe that he must needs depart and travel into another country, and went to take leave of Guerrino, thanking him in hearty wise for the boon of his company and good usage, but Guerrino, who had conceived the strongest love and friendship for him, would on no account let him go, and showed him such strong evidence of his good feeling that in the end the young man agreed to tarry with him. In the country round about Irlanda there lived at this time two very fearful and savage animals, one of which was a wild horse, and the other a mare of like nature, and so ferocious and cruel were these beasts that they not only ravaged and devastated all the fair cultivated fields, but likewise killed all the animals and the men and women dwelling there in. And through the ruin wrought by these beasts the country had come to such piteous condition that no one was found willing to abide there, so that the peasants abandoned their farms and the homes which were dear to them and be took themselves to find dwelling-places in another land. And there was nowhere to be found any man strong and bold enough to face them, much less to fight with them and slay them. Wherefore the king, seeing that the whole country was being made desolate of all victuals, and of cattle, and of human creatures, and not knowing how to devise any remedy for this wretched pass, gave way to dolorous lamentations, and cursed the hard and evil fortune which had befallen him. The two servants of Guerrino, who during the journey had not been able to carry out their wicked intent through want of concord between themselves, and on account of the arrival of the unknown youth, now deliberated how they might compass Guerrino's death and remain possessors of the money and jewels, and said one to the other: 'Let us now see and take counsel together how we may easiest take the life of our master.' But not being able to find any means thereto which seemed fitting, seeing that they would stand in peril of losing their own lives by the law if they should kill him, they decided to speak privily with their host and to tell him that Guerrino was a youth of great prowess and valour; furthermore, that he had often boasted in their presence that he would be ready to slay this wild horse without incurring any danger to himself. Thus they reasoned with themselves: 'Now this saying may easily come to the ears of the king, who, being so keenly set on the destruction of these two animals and on safeguarding the welfare of his country, will straightway command them to bring Guerrino before him, and will then inquire of the youth in what manner he means to accomplish this feat. Then Guerrino, knowing nothing what to say or to do, will at once be put to death by the king, and we shall remain sole masters of the jewels and the money.' And they forth with set to work to put this wicked plan of theirs into action. The host, when he listened to this speech, rejoiced amain, and was as glad as any man in all the world, and without losing a moment of time he ran swiftly to the palace, and having knelt down be fore the king and made due reverence, he said to him secretly, 'Gracious king, I have come to tell you that there is at present sojourning in my hostel a fair and gallant knight errant, who is called by name Guerrino. Now whilst I was confabulating about divers matters with his servants they told me, amongst other things, how their master was a man of great prowess and well skilled in the use and practice of arms, and that in this our time one might search in vain to find another who could be compared with him. Moreover, they had many and many a time heard him boast that of his strength and valour he could without difficulty overcome and slay the wild horse which is working such dire loss and damage to your kingdom.' When King Zifroi heard these words he immediately gave command that Guerrino should be brought before him. Whereupon the innkeeper, obedient to the word of the king, returned at once to his inn and said to Guerrino that he was to betake himself alone into the pres ence of the king, who greatly desired to speak with him. When Guerrino heard this he went straightway to the palace and presented himself to the king, and after saluting him with becoming reverence begged to be told for what reason he had been honoured with the royal commands. To this Zifroi the king made answer: 'Guerrino, the reason which has induced me to send for you is that I have heard you are a knight of great valour, and one excelling all the other knights now alive in the world. They tell me, too, that you have many and many a time declared that you are strong and valorous enough to overcome and slay the wild horse which is working such cruel ruin and devastation to this my kingdom, without risk of hurt to yourself or to others. If you can pluck up courage enough to make trial of an emprise so full of honour as this, and prove yourself a conqueror, I promise you by this head of mine to bestow upon you a gift which will make you a happy man for the rest of your days.' Guerrino, when he heard this proposition of the king, so grave and weighty, was mightily amazed, and at once denied that he had ever spoken such words as had been attributed to him. The king, who was greatly disconcerted at this answer of Guerrino, thus addressed him: 'Guerrino, it is my will that you should without delay undertake this task, and be sure if you refuse and fail to comply with my wishes I will take away your life.' The king, having thus spoken, dismissed from his presence Guerrino, who returned to his inn overwhelmed with deep sorrow, which he did not dare to disclose to anyone. Whereupon the unknown youth, marking that Guerrino, contrary to his wont, was plunged in melancholy, inquired the reason why he was so sad and full of grief. Then Guerrino, on account of the brotherly love subsisting between them, and finding himself unable to refuse this just and kind request, told him word for word everything that had happened to him. As soon as the unknown youth heard this, he said, 'Be of good cheer, and put aside all doubts and fears, for I will point out to you a way by which you will save your life, and be a conqueror in your enterprise, and fulfil the wishes of the king. Return, therefore, to the king, and beg of him to grant you the service of a skilful blacksmith. Then order this smith to make for you four horseshoes, which must be thicker and broader by the breadth of two fingers than the ordinary measure of horseshoes, well roughed, and each one to be fitted behind with two spikes of a finger's length and sharpened to a point. And when these shoes are prepared, you must have my horse, which is enchanted, shod therewith, and then you need have no further fear of anything.' Guerrino, after he had heard these words, returned to the presence of the king, and told him everything as the young man had directed him. The king then caused to be brought before him a well-skilled marshal smith, to whom he gave orders that he should carry out whatever work Guerrino might require of him. When they had gone to the smith's forge, Guerrino instructed him how to make the four horseshoes according to the words of the young stranger, but when the smith understood in what fashion he was required to make these shoes, he mocked at Guerrino, and treated him like a madman, for this way of making shoes was quite strange and unknown to him. When Guerrino saw that the marshal smith was inclined to mock him, and unwilling to serve him as he had been ordered, he went once more to the king, and complained that the smith would not carry out his directions. Wherefore the king bade them bring the marshal before him, and gave him express command that, under pain of his highest displeasure, he should at once carry out the duties which had been imposed upon him, or, failing this, he himself should forthwith make ready to carry out the perilous task which had been assigned to Guerrino. The smith, thus hard pressed by the orders of the king, made the horseshoes in the way described by Guerrino, and shod the horse therewith. When the horse was thus shod and well-accoutred with everything that was necessary for the enterprise, the young stranger addressed Guerrino in these words: 'Now mount quickly this my horse, and go in peace, and as soon as you shall hear the neighing of the wild horse dismount at once, and, having taken off from him his saddle and his bridle, let him range at will. You yourself climb up into a high tree, and there await the issue of the enterprise.' Guerrino, having been fully instructed by his dear companion in all that he ought to do, took his leave, and departed with a light heart. Already the glorious news had been spread abroad through all the parts of Irlanda how a valiant and handsome young knight had undertaken to subjugate and capture the wild horse and to present him to the king, and for this reason everyone in the city, men and women alike, all flew to their windows to see him go by on his perilous errand. When they marked how handsome and young and gallant he was, their hearts were moved to pity on his account, and they said one to another, 'Ah, the poor youth! With what a willing spirit he goes to his death. Of a surety it is a piteous thing that so valiant a youth should thus wretchedly perish.' And they could none of them keep back their tears on account of the compassion they felt. But Guerrino, full of manly boldness, went on his way blithely, and when he had come to the spot where the wild horse was wont to abide, and heard the sound of his neigh, he got down from his own horse, and having taken the saddle and bridle therefrom he let him go free, and himself climbed up into the branches of a great oak, and there awaited the fierce and bloody contest. Scarcely had Guerrino climbed up into the tree when the wild horse appeared and forthwith attacked the fairy horse, and then the two beasts engaged in the fiercest struggle that the world had ever seen, for they rushed at one another as if they had been two unchained lions, and they foamed at the mouth as if they had been bristly wild boars pursued by savage and eager hounds. Then, after they had fought for some time with the greatest fury, the fairy horse dealt the wild horse two kicks full on the jaw, which was put out of joint thereby; wherefore the wild horse was at once disabled, and could no longer either fight or defend himself. When Guerrino saw this he rejoiced greatly, and having come down from the oak, he took a halter which he had brought with him and secured the wild horse therewith, and led him with his dislocated jaw back to the city, where he was welcomed by all the people with the greatest joy. According to his promise he presented the horse to the king, who, together with all the inhabitants of the city, held high festival, and rejoiced amain over the gallant deed wrought by Guerrino. But the servants of Guerrino were greatly overcome with grief and confusion, inasmuch as their evil designs had miscarried; wherefore, inflamed with rage and hatred, they once more let it come to the hearing of King Zifroi that Guerrino had vaunted that he could with the greatest ease kill the wild mare also when ever it might please him. When the king heard this he laid exactly the same commands on Guerrino as he had done in the matter of the horse, and because the youth refused to undertake this task, which appeared to him impossible, the king threatened to have him hung up by one foot as a rebel against his crown. After Guerrino had returned to his inn, he told everything to his unknown companion, who smilingly said: 'My good brother, fret not yourself because of this, but go and find the marshal smith, and command him to make for you four more horseshoes, as big again as the last, and see that they are duly furnished with good sharp spikes. Then you must follow exactly the same course as you took with the horse, and you will return here covered with greater honour than ever.' When therefore he had commanded to be made the sharply-spiked horseshoes, and had caused the valiant fairy horse to be shod therewith, he set forth on his gallant enterprise. As soon as Guerrino had come to the spot where the wild mare was wont to graze, and heard her neighing, he did everything exactly in the same manner as before, and when he had set free the fairy horse, the mare came towards it and attacked it with such fierce and terrible biting that it could with difficulty defend itself against such an attack. But it bore the assault valiantly, and at last succeeded in planting so sharp and dexterous a kick on the mare that she was lamed in her right leg, whereupon Guerrino came down from the high tree into which he had climbed, and having captured her, bound her securely. Then he mounted his own horse and rode back to the palace, where he presented the wild mare to the king, amidst the rejoicings and acclamations of all the people. And everyone, attracted by wonderment and curiosity, ran to see this wild beast, which, on account of the grave injuries she had received in the fight, soon died. And by these means the country was freed from the great plague which had for so long a time vexed it. Now when Guerrino had returned to his hostel, and had betaken himself to repose somewhat on account of the weariness which had come over him, he found that he was unable to get any sleep by reason of a strange noise which he heard somewhere in the chamber. Wherefore, having risen from his couch, he perceived that there was something, I know not what, beating about inside a pot of honey, and not able to get out. So Guerrino opened the honey-pot, and saw within a large hornet, which was struggling with its wings without being able to free itself from the honey around it. Moved by pity, he took hold of the insect and let it go free. Now Zifroi the king had as yet given to Guerrino no reward for the two valiant deeds which he had wrought, but he was conscious in his heart that he would be acting in a very base fashion were he to leave such great valour without a rich guerdon, so he caused Guerrino to be called into his presence, and thus ad dressed him: 'Guerrino, by your noble deeds the whole of my kingdom is now free from the scourge, therefore I intend to reward you for the great benefits you have wrought in our behalf; but as I can conceive of no other gift which would be worthy and sufficient for your merits, I have determined to give you one of my two daughters to wife. But you must know that of these two sisters one is called Potentiana, and she has hair braided in such marvellous wise that it shines like golden coils. The other is called Eleuteria, and her tresses are of such texture that they flash brightly like the finest silver. Now if you can guess -- the maidens being closely veiled the while -- which is she of the golden tresses, I will give her to you as your wife, together with a mighty dowry of money; but if you fail in this, I will have your head struck off your shoulders.' Guerrino, when he heard this cruel ordeal which was proposed by Zifroi the king, was mightily amazed, and turning to him spake thus: 'O gracious sovereign! Is this a worthy guerdon for all the perils and fatigues I have undergone? Is this a reward for the strength I have spent on your behalf? Is this the gratitude you give me for having delivered your country from the scourge by which it was of late laid desolate? Alas! I did not merit this return, which of a truth is not a deed worthy of such a mighty king as yourself. But since this is your pleasure and I am helpless in your hands, you must do with me what pleases you best.' 'Now go,' said Zifroi, 'and tarry no longer in my presence. I give you till tomorrow to come to a decision.' When Guerrino went out of the king's presence full of sadness, he sought his dear companion, and repeated to him everything that the king had said. The unknown youth when he heard this seemed but little troubled thereanent, and said: 'Guerrino, be of good cheer, and do not despair, for I will deliver you from this great danger. Remember how a few days ago you set free the hornet which you found with its wings entangled in the honey. Now this same hornet will be the means of saving you, for to morrow, after the dinner at the palace, when you are put to the test, it will fly three times buzzing and humming round the head of her with the golden hair, and she with her white hands will drive it away. And you, when you shall have marked her do this action three times, may know for certain that this is she who is to be your wife.' 'Ah me!' cried Guerrino to his companion, 'When will the time come when I shall be able to make you some repayment for all the kind offices you have done me? Certes, were I to live for a thousand years, I should never have it in my power to recompense you the very smallest portion thereof. But that one, who is the rewarder of all, will in this matter make up for me in that respect in which I am wanting.' To this speech of Guerrino his companion made answer: 'Guerrino, my brother, there is in sooth no need for you to trouble yourself about making any return to me for the services I may have wrought you, but assuredly it is now full time that I should reveal to you, and that you should know clearly who I am. For in the same fashion as you delivered me from death, I on my part have desired to render to you the recompense you deserve so highly at my hands. Know, then, that I am the wild man of the woods whom you, with such loving compassion, set free from the prison-house of the king your father, and that I am called by name Rubinetto.' And then he went on to tell Guerrino by what means the fairy had brought him back into his former state of a fair young man. Guerrino, when he heard these words, stood like one bemused, and out of the great tenderness and pity he had in his heart he embraced Rubinetto, weeping the while, and kissed him, and claimed him as his own brother. And forasmuch as the day was now approaching for Guerrino to solve the question to be set to him by King Zifroi, the two repaired to the palace, where upon the king gave order that his two beloved daughters, Potentiana and Eleuteria, should be brought into the presence of Guerrino covered from head to foot with white veils, and this was straightway done. When the two daughters had come in so much alike in seeming that it was impossible to tell the one from the other, the king said: 'Now which of these two, Guerrino, do you will that I should give you to wife?' But Guerrino stood still in a state of doubt and hesitation, and answered no thing, but the king, who was mightily curious to see how the matter would end, pressed him amain to speak, crying out that time was flying, and that it behoved him to give his answer at once. To this Guerrino made answer: 'Most sacred majesty, time forsooth may be flying, but the end is not yet come to this day, which is the limit you have given me for my decision.' And all those standing by affirmed that Guerrino only claimed his right. When, therefore, the king and Guerrino and all the others had stood for a long time in expectation, behold! there suddenly appeared a hornet, which at once began to fly and buzz round the head and the fair face of Potentiana of the golden hair. And she, as if she were afeared of the thing, raised her hand to drive it away, and when she had done this three times the hornet flew away out of sight. But even after this sign Guerrino remained uncertain for a short time, although he had full faith in the words of Rubinetto, his well-beloved companion. Then said the king, 'How now, Guerrino, what do you say? The time has now come when you must put an end to this delay, and make up your mind.' And Guerrino, having looked well first at one and then at the other of the maidens, put his hand on the head of Potentiana, who had been pointed out to him by the hornet, and said, 'Gracious king, this one is your daughter of the golden tresses.' And when the maiden had raised her veil it was clearly proved that it was indeed she, greatly to the joy of all those who were present, and to the satisfaction of the people of the city. And Zifroi the king gave her to Guerrino as his wife, and they did not depart thence until Rubinetto had wedded the other sister. After this Guerrino declared himself to be the son of Filippomaria, King of Sicily, hearing which Zifroi was greatly rejoiced, and caused the marriages to be celebrated with the greatest pomp and magnificence. When this news came to the father and the mother of Guerrino they felt the greatest joy and contentment, seeing that they had by this time given up their son as lost. When he returned to Sicily with his dear wife and his well-loved brother and sister-in-law, they all received a gracious and loving welcome from his father and mother, and they lived a long time in peace and happiness, and he left behind him fair children as the heirs of his kingdom. This touching story told by Eritrea won the highest praise of all the hearers.", "title": "Guerrino and the Savage Man", "id": 532}
{"label": "130", "text": "The miller of Sandhills had a donkey which had served him well in its time, but was now too old to work. The miller was a careful man, who did not believe in feeding useless mouths, so he decided that he would sell the donkey for the price of its skin. 'I do not suppose I shall get very much for the wretched beast,' he said, regarding poor Grayskin as he stood with hanging head in his stall, 'but I shall save the cost of his corn anyhow, and that is always something.' Left alone, Grayskin reflected sadly upon the fate in store for him. 'Such is the way of the world,' he thought. 'When I was young and hearty nothing was too good for me. Now I'm old and useless I am to be cast out. But am I so useless after all? True, I can no longer pull a cart to market, but I have a magnificent voice still. There must be a place somewhere for one who can sing as beautifully as I. I'll go to the Cathedral of St. Gudule in Brussels and offer myself as a chorister.' Grayskin lost no time in acting upon his resolve, but left his stable immediately and set out on the road to Brussels. Passing the burgomaster's house he saw an old hound sitting disconsolately on the doorstep. 'Hallo, friend!' said he. 'What is the matter with you? You seem very sad this morning.' 'The matter is that I am tired of life,' answered the dog. 'I'm getting old and stiff, and I can no longer hunt hares for my master as I used to do. The result is that I am reckoned good for nothing, and they grudge me every morsel of food I put into my mouth.' 'Come, come, cheer up, my friend,' said Grayskin. 'Never say die! I am in a similar case to yourself and have just left my master for precisely the same reason. My plan is to go to the Cathedral of St. Gudule and offer my services to the master of the choir. If I may say so without conceit, I have a lovely voice -- one must make the most of one's gifts, you know -- and I ought to be able to command good pay.' 'Well, if it comes to that,' said the dog, 'I can sing too. I sang a lovely song to the moon last night, and if you'll believe me, all the people in our street opened their windows to listen. I sang for quite an hour, and I'd have gone on longer if some malicious person, who was no doubt jealous, had not thrown an old boot at my head.' 'Excellent,' said Grayskin. 'Come along with me. You shall sing tenor and I'll sing bass. We'll make a famous pair.' So the dog joined company with Grayskin, and they went on together towards Brussels. A little farther down the road they saw a cat sitting on the rubbish heap outside a miserable hovel. The creature was half blind with age and had a face as long as a fiddle. 'Why, what is the matter with you?' asked Grayskin, who had a tender heart. 'Matter enough,' said the cat. 'I've just been turned out of house and home, and all because I took a little piece of bacon from the larder. Upon my honor, it was no bigger than a baby's fist, but they made as much fuss as though it had been a whole gammon. I was beaten and kicked out to starve. If I could catch mice as I used to do, it would not matter so much, but the mice are too quick for me nowadays. They laugh at me. Nothing remains for me but to die, and I hope it may be soon.' 'Nonsense,' said Grayskin. 'You shall live to laugh at all your troubles. Come along with us and sing in the choir at St. Gudule. Your voice is a little too thin for my own taste, but you'll make a very good soprano in a trio. What do you say?' 'You give me new hopes,' answered the cat. 'Of course I'll join you,' and so the three went on together. Towards nightfall they arrived at a farmyard, on the gate of which a cock was crowing lustily. 'Hall!' said Grayskin. 'What's all this about?' 'I am singing my last song on earth,' said the cock. 'An hour ago I sang a song, although it is not my usual custom to crow in the afternoon, and as I ended I heard the farmer's wife say, 'Hearken to Chanticleer. He's crowing for fine weather tomorrow. I wonder if he'd crow so loudly if he knew that we had guests coming, and that he was going into the pot to make their soup!' She has a horrid laugh, that woman. I have always hated her!' 'And do you mean to tell me,' said Grayskin, 'that you are going to stay here quite contentedly till they come to wring your neck?' 'What else can I do?' asked Chanticleer. 'Join us and turn your talents to account. We are all beautiful singers and we are going to Brussels to offer ourselves as choristers at St. Gudule. We were a trio before. With you we shall be a quartet, and that's one better!' Chanticleer was only too glad to find a means of escape, so he willingly joined the party, and they once more took the road. A little while afterwards they came to a thick wood, which was the haunt of a notorious band of robbers. There they decided to rest for the night, so Grayskin and the dog lay down beneath the shelter of a large beech tree, while the cat climbed onto one of the branches, and Chanticleer perched himself at the very top. From this lofty post he could see over the whole wood, and it was not long before he espied a light twinkling among the trees not far away. 'There must be a house of some sort over there,' he said to his companions. 'Shall we go and see? We may find something to eat.' 'Or some straw to lie upon, at any rate,' said Grayskin. 'This damp ground gives me rheumatics in my old bones.' 'I was just thinking the same thing,' said the dog. 'Let us go.' So the four choristers, led by the cock, walked in the direction from which the light came, and before long they found themselves in front of a little house, the windows of which were brilliantly lighted. In order to reach to the windows the animals made a tower of their bodies, with Grayskin at the bottom and Chanticleer at the top. Now this house was the abode of a band of robbers, who, at that very moment, were seated before a table laden with all kinds of food. There they sat and feasted, and poor Chanticleer's mouth watered as he watched them. 'Is there anybody inside?' asked the dog, who was impatient. 'Hush!' said Chanticleer. 'Men! They're eating their dinner!' 'I wish I was,' said the dog. 'What are they eating?' 'All sorts of things -- sausage and fish ....' 'Sausage!' said the dog. 'Fish!' said the cat. 'And ever so many other delicacies,' Chanticleer went on. 'Look here, friends. Wouldn't it be a fine thing if we could get a share of their meal? I confess that my stomach aches with hunger.' 'And mine too,' said the dog. 'I've never been so hungry in my life. But how are we to get the food?' 'Let us serenade them, and perhaps they'll throw us something as a reward,' said Grayskin. 'Music, you know, has charms to soothe the savage breast.' This seemed such a good idea that the choristers lost no time in putting it into execution. All four began to sing. They donkey hee-hawed, the dog howled, the cat meowed, and the cock crowed. From the noise they made one would have thought that the heavens were falling. The effect of this marvelous quartet upon the robbers was instantaneous. Leaping from their seats, they ran from place to place in mortal terror, tumbling over one another, oversetting chairs and adding to the racket by their shrieks and cries. At that moment the cock fell against the window, breaking the glass to smithereens. The donkey gave the frame a push, and all the four precipitated themselves into the room. This was the last straw. The robbers could stand no more. Half mad with fear they rushed to the door and fled into the forest. Then our four choristers drew up to the table and set to work upon the food with which it was laden. Their long walk had given them a good appetite, so that there was little left by the time they had finished. Feeling drowsy after their meal, they then settled themselves to sleep. The donkey made himself a bed on a heap of straw in the yard; the dog stretched himself out upon the mat by the house door; the cat lay among the warm cinders on the hearth; and the cock perched upon the rooftop. A few minutes more and they were all fast asleep. Meanwhile the robbers, who had retreated some distance into the forest, waited anxiously for something dreadful to happen. An hour passed by and there was neither sight nor sound to alarm them, so they began to feel a little ashamed of their cowardice. Creeping stealthily nearer to the cottage, they saw that everything was still, and that no light was showing from the windows. At last the robber chief sent his lieutenant to spy out the land, and this man, returning to the cottage without mishap, found his way into the kitchen and proceeded to light a candle. He had no matches, but he saw two sparks of fire among the cinders on the hearth, so he went forward to get a light from them. Now this light came from the cat's eyes, and as soon as puss felt the robber touch her, she sprang up, snarling and spitting, and scratched his face. With a scream of terror, he dropped his candle and rushed for the door, and as he passed, the dog bit him in the leg. By this time the noise had awakened Grayskin, who got upon his feet just as the man ran by, and helped him forward with a might kick, which sent him flying out into the roadway. Seeing this, the cock on the housetop spread his wings and crowed in triumph, 'Cock-a-doodle-doo!' I wish you could have seen the way that robber ran! He covered the ground so quickly that he seemed like a flying shadow, and I am perfectly certain that not even a hare could have overtaken him. At last, panting for breath, he rejoined his comrades in the forest, who were eagerly awaiting his return. 'Well,' cried the chief, 'is the way clear? Can we go back?' 'Not on any account,' cried the robber. 'There's a horrible witch in the kitchen. Directly I entered she sprang at me and tore my face with her long claws, calling out at the same time to her creatures to come and devour me. As I ran through the door, one of them buried his fangs in my leg, and a little farther on, in the yard, a great black monster struck at me with an enormous club, giving me a blow that nearly broke my backbone. On the roof a little demon with wings and eyes that shone like coals of fire cried, 'Stop him! Eat him! Stop him! Eat him!' You may guess that I did not wait for more. It is a miracle that I have escaped with my life!' When they heard this terrible story the robbers lost no time in decamping, and such was their terror that they deserted the forest altogether and went away to another part of the country. The result was that our four friends were left to dwell in the cottage, where they lived happily for the rest of their lives, and as they had now everything they wanted, they quite gave up their idea of going to St. Gudule.", "title": "The Choristers of St. Gudule", "id": 533}
{"label": "500", "text": "There was once a king who wanted to marry, but he had decided to take no woman for a wife who did not have pitch-black hair and eyes of the same color. It made no difference to him whether she was of high or low birth. Thus he had proclaimed throughout the entire country that all girls with these qualities should report to him. Many presented themselves, but in some instances the blackness did not reach the degree desired by the king, in other instances the hair was wrong, and -- in short -- there was a problem with each and every one. A charcoal burner was walking along the path with his daughter. Seeing the crowd of people before the king's castle, she asked her father what it meant. He told her how the king wanted to marry someone with black hair and black eyes, but that he could not find anyone who had them to his satisfaction. The charcoal burner's daughter had both. Therefore she said to her father, 'May I go there?' He replied, 'Are you so stupid that you think the king would take you for his wife?' She told him that she would like to go and just look around the palace a little. He gave his permission, and she walked toward the palace. On the way she met a little man, who called out to her, 'Hey, girl, what will you give me if you become queen?' She answered, 'Hey, little man, what can I give you? I have nothing.' The little man continued, 'You will become queen, but in three years you must still remember that my name is Kruzimugeli. If you don't know that, then you'll be mine.' 'If that's all you want from me, I'll remember it,' replied the charcoal burner's daughter, and ran to the castle. She took no more heed of the little man who stared after her, rubbing his hands together with satisfaction. As soon as the king saw the charcoal burner's daughter he decided to marry her, for her hair glistened and her eyes sparked with blackness. So she married the king and lived happily together with him. In her happiness she almost failed to notice that the three years were coming to an end, and -- oh fright! -- she had forgotten the little man's name. Now she was always sad and spent every day crying. The king, who loved her dearly, attempted to cheer her up with festivities, but all to no avail. Whenever he asked her why she was so sad, she always answered that she could not tell him. One day the royal forester was out in the woods in search of game for the king's table. Going deeper into the woods, he saw a little man who had made a fire and was jumping over it with spiteful joy, singing the whole time: The little man did indeed come the next day, and he asked the queen, 'Now, Your Highness, do you still know my name? You may guess three times, and if you are not right, then you belong to me.' The queen answered, 'I think your name is Steffel.' Hearing this, the little man jumped into the air with joy, and shouted with all his might, 'Not right!' The queen then said, 'Then your name must be Veitl.' The little man made another leap, and called out once more, 'Not right!' Now the queen said very quietly, 'Then your name must be Kruzimugeli.' Hearing this, and without answering, the little man jumped with a roar through the wall to the outside. All attempts to repair the hole that he made in the wall remained fruitless. But the queen and her husband lived happily and contentedly for a long time.", "title": "Kruzimugeli", "id": 534}

'How is it you don't eat meat?' 'You forget that I have no teeth. How do you expect me to eat meat without teeth?' 'That is true,' said the husband, and he said nothing more, because he was afraid to grieve his wife, who was as wicked as she was ugly. When one has twenty-five children one cannot think of them all the time, and one does not see if one or two are missing. One day, after his dinner, the husband asked for his children. When they were by him he counted them, and found only fifteen. He asked his wife where were the ten others. She answered that they were at their grandmother's, and every day she would send one more for them to get a change of air. That was true, every day there was one that was missing. One day the husband was at the threshold of his house, in front of a large stone which was there. He was thinking of his children, and he wanted to go and get them at their grandmother's, when he heard voices that were saying: At first he did not understand what that meant, but he raised the stone and saw a great quantity of bones, which began to sing again. He then understood that it was the bones of his children, whom his wife had killed, and whom he had eaten. Then he was so angry that he killed his wife, buried his children's bones in the cemetery, and stayed alone at his house. From that time he never ate meat, because he believed it would always be his children that he would eat.", "title": "The Singing Bones (Louisiana)", "id": 536}
{"label": "503", "text": "There was once a man who had one son, who married a widow who also had one son, and both were hunchbacks. The wife took very good care of her own son, but the son of her husband she used to put to hard work and gave him scarcely anything to eat. Her son, too, used to imitate, his mother, and sadly ill-treat his stepbrother. After treating him ill for a long time, she at last sent him away from the house altogether. The poor little hunchback wandered away without knowing where to go. On, on, on he went, till at last he came to a lonely hut on a wide moor. At his approach a whole host of little hunchbacks came out and danced round him, chanting plaintively: Sabbato! Domenica! a great number of times. At last our little hunchback felt his courage stirred, and, taking up the note of their chant, chimed in with: Lunedi! Instantly the dancing ceased, all the little hunchback dwarfs became full-grown, well-formed men, and, what was better still, his own hump was gone too, and he felt that he, too, was a well-grown lad. 'Good people,' said our hunchback -- now hunchbacked no more -- ''I thank you much for ridding me of my hump and making me a well-grown lad. Give me now some work to do among you, and let me live with you.' But the chief of the strange people answered him and said: 'This favour we owe to you, not you to us; for it was your chiming in with the right word on the right note which destroyed the spell that held us all. And in testimony of our gratitude we give you further this little wand, and you will not need to work with us. Go back and live at home, and if ever anyone beats you as heretofore, you have only to say to it, 'At 'em, good stick!' and you will see what it will do for you.' Then all disappeared, and the boy went home. 'So you've come back, have you?' said the stepmother. 'What, and without your hump, too! Where have you left that?' Then the good boy told her all that had happened, without hiding anything. 'Do you hear that?' said the stepmother to her own son. 'Now go you and get rid of your hump in the same way.' So the second hunchback went forth, and journeyed on till he came to the lonely hut on the moor. A tribe of hunchbacks came out and danced round him, and sung' to which the bad son of the stepmother added in his rough voice, all out of tune: Martedi! Immediately all the hunchbacks came round him and gave him a drubbing, and the chief of them stuck on him a hump in front as well as behind. Thus they sent him home to his mother. When his mother saw him come home in this plight, she turned upon the stepson and abused him for having misled her son to injure him; and both mother and son set upon him and belaboured him after their wont. But he had only told the truth, without intention to deceive; and the stepmother's son had incurred the anger of the dwarfs by his discordant addition to their chant. So the first hero took out his wand and said, 'At' em, good stick!' and the wand flew out of his hand and administered on mother and son a sounder drubbing than that they had themselves been administering. Ever after that he was able to live at home in peace, for everyone was afraid to injure him because of the power of his stick.", "title": "The Two Hunchbacked Brothers", "id": 537}
{"label": "441", "text": "Many years ago there lived a very rich king in a beautiful city near a wild forest, the home of many wicked witches. The king had a gallant son named Ucay, who fell in love with a beautiful young witch, the daughter of the most bitter enemy of his father. When Ucay became old enough to marry, his father requested him to select the most beautiful lady in the city for his wife; but the prince would neither select one, nor would he tell his father about his love for the witch. So the rich king ordered his soldiers to bring to the palace all the beautiful women that could be found in the kingdom. His order was soon obeyed, but none of the girls suited the prince. So the king took the matter of selection into his own hands; and, after choosing a very handsome girl, he forced his son to marry her. Out of fear, Ucay consented to do as his father bade him. But the beautiful young witch to whom he had already pledged his love became angry with him for his timidity, and so she resolved to change the city into a forest of beautiful trees. Her fickle lover she transformed into a monkey, who should live in the tallest tree, and who should not be able to recover his human shape till five centuries had past, when a charming girl would live with him and love him more than anything else. Moreover, she changed the king's subjects into other animals as she pleased. No sooner had the marriage of the prince been proclaimed, then, than the desire of the witch was accomplished, to the great surprise of the neighboring cities. Four centuries had already passed. The wonderful disappearance of the city was already forgotten, and people from other places began to build houses in the enchanted city. The monkey-prince was always watching for an opportunity to catch a beautiful girl who should break the spell that kept him in his miserable condition. Soon a church was built near the foot of the tree in which he lived. He had already succeeded in capturing two ladies, but they had died of fear. After incalculable suffering and extraordinary patience, the time for his recovery came at last. One Sunday morning before the mass was over, a very beautiful girl, the daughter of a poor man, came out of the church and sat at the foot of the tree. She had been disappointed in her love with a rich man's son, who had forsaken her in order to marry the daughter of a rich man. So she wished to die. When the monkey-prince saw her sitting there alone, he noiselessly went down, carefully took her by the right hand, and carried her to the top of the tree. She would have died of fright, as was the fate of the two former women, had she not seen in the monkey's eyes a noble look that filled her with wonder and sympathy. As days went by, she lived on delicious fruits which were entirely strange to her; and her love for the poor creature grew greater and greater, until at last she loved him more than anything else. On the evening of the tenth day she was surprised to find herself beside a gallant prince in a richly decorated room. At first she thought that she was dreaming; but when the prince woke up, kissed her, and then told her the history of his life, she knew that it was real. She was so astonished, that she exclaimed, 'Ah, me! God is wise!' The next morning she was crowned queen of her husband's happy subjects, whom she had restored from the enchantment of the wicked witch. Everyone in the kingdom loved his new queen as long as he lived.", "title": "The Enchanted Prince", "id": 538}

With this view, he made an appointment to meet her one evening in a secluded field. She was at the rendezvous considerably before the time agreed upon for their meeting, and hid herself in a tree. The student arrived on the spot shortly afterwards, but what was the astonishment of the girl to observe that he commenced digging a grave. Her fears and suspicions were aroused, and she did not leave her place of concealment till the student, despairing of her arrival, returned to his college. The next day, when she was at the door of her father's house, he passed and saluted her as usual. She returned his greeting by repeating the following lines: Astounded by her unexpected knowledge of his base design, in a moment of fury he stabbed her to the heart. This murder occasioned a violent conflict between the tradespeople and the students, the latter taking part with the murderer, and so fierce was the skirmish, that Brewer's Lane, it is said, ran down with blood. The place of appointment was adjoining the Divinity Walk, which was in time past far more secluded than at the present day, and she is said to have been buried in the grave made for her by her paramour. According to another version of the tale, the name of the student was Fox, and a fellow student went with him to assist in digging the grave.

'Where are you going, Henny-Penny?' says Cocky-Locky. 'Oh! I'm going to tell the king the sky's a-falling,' says Henny-Penny. 'May I come with you?' says Cocky-Locky. 'Certainly,' says Henny-Penny.

{"label": "1586", "text": "At last the servant, incensed at the boldness and persistency of the fly, rashly made trial to kill it when it was about to settle again on his master's temple and suck his blood. Simple fool that he was, he caught up a weighty bronze pestle, and, striking at the fly with all his might with the intent to kill it, he made an end of the grocer instead. As soon as Fortunio saw that he had slain his master and thereby made himself liable to death by the law, he took counsel with himself how he might best save his neck, and first resolved to seek safety in flight, but he afterwards fixed upon another scheme, which was to bury the corpse secretly. Therefore, having wrapped up the dead body of his master in a sack and carried it into a garden adjacent to the shop, he buried it there. This done he went to the sheepfold, and, having chosen a big old ram, he took it and threw it down the well. As the master did not appear at his usual hour in the evening the wife's suspicion fell upon Fortunio, and she questioned him as to her husband's whereabouts, but the fellow declared stoutly that he knew nothing of it. Then the good wife, overcome with grief, began to weep and to call for her husband aloud, but she called in vain. She went to her kinsfolk and told them her grief; whereupon they sought the governor of the city, and laid the crime to Fortunio's charge, demanding that he should be imprisoned and put to the question, in order to make him tell what had become of his master. The governor, having put the servant in hold and tied him to the rope, gave him the strappado as prescribed by law, on account of the charges against him. Handling of this sort was not to his taste, and he forthwith promised to tell all he knew, if they would let him down. So they brought him before the judge, and this was the cunning tale he had prepared for their befooling: 'Yesterday, O judge! when I was asleep near the well, I was awakened by a great noise, as of some mighty rock being hurled down into the water below. In my amazement I ran to the well and looked into it, but the water was quite clear and I could see nothing amiss; so I turned to go back to the house, when the same noise again met my ears. I am now quite sure in my mind that my master, when trying to draw some water up out of the well, fell down into it. Now, that the truth of the matter may be laid bare, I make petition that all now present may go to the spot; then I will descend into the well and disclose what I may find therein.' The judge was favorable to Fortunio's prayer, holding that experiment is the surest proof, and that no evidence can equal what is brought before one's eyes, and betook himself to the well, bidding the whole assembly follow. There went not only the worshipful persons who were about the judge, but also a vast crowd of the common people, who were curious to learn what might be the issue of the affair. Fortunio, obeying the commandment of the judge, went straightway down the well, and, when he had reached the bottom, made believe to be searching for his master's body in the water; but what he found was the carcass of the old ram which he himself had lately cast in. Feigning to be vastly amazed at this, the cunning fellow bawled up from the bottom of the well, 'O my mistress! Tell me whether your husband, my poor master, had horns or not; for I have alighted on somebody down here who has got an enormous pair, both long and large. Is it possible that he can be your husband?' And when the good wife heard Fortunio's question she was so much overcome with shame that she could not find a word to say for herself. Meanwhile the bystanders waited, open-mouthed with curiosity, to set eyes on this corpse with horns, and to see whether it really was the body of the missing grocer or not; and when they saw hauled up Fortunio's old ram, they all clapped their hands, and were shaken by loud laughter. The judge, when he saw the issue of Fortunio's search, deemed that the foolish fellow was acting in good faith, and that he verily believed what he brought out of the well to be the remains of his master. On this account the judge let him go free, as innocent, but the grocer was never seen more, and the good wife, to her dying day, bore the shame anent the horns which Fortunio's cunning trick had cast upon her.", "title": "Fortunio", "id": 541}
{"label": "1540", "text": "There was an old soldier who had been long in the wars -- so long, that he was quite out-at-elbows, and he did not know where to go to find a living. So he walked up moors, down glens, till at last he came to a farm, from which the good man had gone away to market. The wife of the farmer was a very foolish woman. The farmer was foolish enough, too, and it is hard to say which of the two was the most foolish. When you've heard my tale you may decide. Now before the farmer goes to market says he to his wife, 'Here is ten pounds all in gold. Take care of it till I come home.' If the man had not been a fool he would never have given the money to his wife to keep. Well, off he went in his cart to market, and the wife said to herself, 'I will keep the ten pounds quite safe from thieves.' So she tied it up in a rag, and she put the rag up the parlor chimney. 'There,' said she. 'No thieves will ever find it now; that is quite sure.' Jack Hannaford, the old soldier, came and rapped at the door. 'Who is there?' asked the wife. 'Jack Hannaford.' 'Where do you come from?' 'Paradise.' 'Lord a' mercy! And maybe you've seen my old man there,' alluding to her former husband. 'Yes, I have.' 'And how was he a-doing?' asked the goody [woman]. 'But middling. He cobbles old shoes, and he has nothing but cabbage for victuals.' 'Deary me!' exclaimed the woman. 'Didn't he send a message to me?' 'Yes, he did,' replied Jack Hannaford. 'He said that he was out of leather, and his pockets were empty, so you were to send him a few shillings to buy a fresh stock of leather.' 'He shall have them, bless his poor soul!' And away went the wife to the parlor chimney, and she pulled the rag with the ten pounds in it from the chimney, and she gave the whole sum to the soldier, telling him that her old man was to use as much as he wanted, and to send back the rest. It was not long that Jack waited after receiving the money. He went off as fast as he could walk. Presently the farmer came home and asked for his money. The wife told him that she had sent it by a soldier to her former husband in paradise, to buy him leather for cobbling the shoes of the saints and angels of heaven. The farmer was very angry, and he swore that he had never met with such a fool as his wife. But the wife said that her husband was a greater fool for letting her have the money. There was no time to waste words, so the farmer mounted his horse and rode off after Jack Hannaford. The old soldier heard the horse's hoofs clattering on the road behind him, so he knew it must be the farmer pursuing him. He lay down on the ground, and shading his eyes with one hand, looked up into the sky, and pointed heavenwards with the other hand. 'What are you about there?' asked the farmer pulling up. 'Lord save you!' exclaimed Jack. 'I've seen a rare sight! A man going straight up into the sky, as if he were walking on a road.' 'Can you see him still?' 'Yes, I can.' 'Where?' 'Get off your horse and lie down.' 'If you will hold the horse.' Jack did so readily. 'I cannot see him,' said the farmer. 'Shade your eyes with your hand, and you'll soon see a man flying away from you.' Sure enough he did so, for Jack leaped on the horse, and rode away with it. The farmer walked home without his horse. 'You are a bigger fool than I am,' said the wife, 'for I did only one foolish thing, and you have done two.'", "title": "Jack Hannaford", "id": 542}
{"label": "1351", "text": "Once upon a time a poor farmer and his wife, having finished their day's labor and eaten their frugal supper, were sitting by the fire, when a dispute arose between them as to who should shut the door, which had been blown open by a gust of wind. 'Wife, shut the door!' said the man. 'Husband, shut it yourself!' said the woman. 'I will not shut it, and you shall not shut it,' said the husband; 'but let the one who speaks the first word shut it.' This proposal pleased the wife exceedingly, and so the old couple, well satisfied, retired in silence to bed. In the middle of the night they heard a noise, and, peering out, they perceived that a wild dog had entered the room, and that he was busy devouring their little store of food. Not a word, however, would either of these silly people utter, and the dog, having sniffed at everything, and having eaten as much as he wanted, went out of the house. The next morning the woman took some grain to the house of a neighbor in order to have it ground into flour. In her absence the barber entered, and said to the husband, 'How is it you are sitting here all alone?' The farmer answered never a word. The barber then shaved his head, but still he did not speak; then he shaved off half his beard and half his mustache, but even then the man refrained from uttering a syllable. Then the barber covered him all over with a hideous coating of lampblack, but the stolid farmer remained as dumb as a mute. 'The man is bewitched!' cried the barber, and he hastily quitted the house. He had hardly gone when the wife returned from the mill. She, seeing her husband in such a ghastly plight, began to tremble, and exclaimed, 'Ah! wretch, what have you been doing?' 'You spoke the first word,' said the farmer, 'so begone, woman, and shut the door.'", "title": "The Farmer, His Wife, and the Open Door", "id": 543}

{"label": "545B", "text": "Hard by the hut was the lair of a jackal. The jackal, remembering the wealth and grandeur of the weaver's forefathers, had compassion on him, and one day coming to him, said, 'Friend weaver, I see what a wretched life you are leading. I have a good mind to improve your condition. I'll try and marry you to the daughter of the king of this country.' 'I become the king's son-in-law!' replied the weaver. 'That will take place only when the sun rises in the west.' 'You doubt my power?' rejoined the jackal. 'You will see, I'll bring it about.' The next morning the jackal started for the king's city, which was many miles off. On the way he entered a plantation of the piper betel plant, and plucked a large quantity of its leaves. He reached the capital, and contrived to get inside the palace. On the premises of the palace was a tank in which the ladies of the king's household performed their morning and afternoon ablutions. At the entrance of that tank the jackal laid himself down. The daughter of the king happened to come just at the time to bathe, accompanied by her maids. The princess was not a little struck at seeing the jackal lying down at the entrance. She told her maids to drive the jackal away. The jackal rose as if from sleep, and instead of running away, opened his bundle of betel-leaves, put some into his mouth, and began chewing them. The princess and her maids were not a little astonished at the sight. They said among themselves, 'What an uncommon jackal is this! From what country can he have come? A jackal chewing betel-leaves! Why thousands of men and women of this city cannot indulge in that luxury. He must have come from a wealthy land.' The princess asked the jackal, 'Sivalu [A name for a jackal, not unlike Reynard in Europe], from what country do you come? It must be a very prosperous country where the jackals chew betel-leaves. Do other animals in your country chew betel-leaves?' 'Dearest princess,' replied the jackal, 'I come from a land flowing with milk and honey. Betel-leaves are as plentiful in my country as the grass in your fields. All animals in my country -- cows, sheep, dogs -- chew betel-leaves. We want no good thing.' 'Happy is the country,' said the princess, 'where there is such plenty, and thrice happy the king who rules in it!' 'As for our king,' said the jackal, 'he is the richest king in the world. His palace is like the heaven of Indra. I have seen your palace here; it is a miserable hut compared to the palace of our king.' The princess, whose curiosity was excited to the utmost pitch, hastily went through her bath, and going to the apartments of the queen-mother, told her of the wonderful jackal lying at the entrance of the tank. Her curiosity being excited, the jackal was sent for. When the jackal stood in the presence of the queen, he began munching the betel-leaves. 'You come,' said the queen, 'from a very rich country. Is your king married?' 'Please your majesty, our king is not married. Princesses from distant parts of the world tried to get married to him, but he rejected them all. Happy will that princess be whom our king condescends to marry!' 'Don't you think, Sivalu,' asked the queen, 'that my daughter is as beautiful as a Peri, and that she is fit to be the wife of the proudest king in the world?' 'I quite think,' said the jackal, 'that the princess is exceedingly handsome; indeed, she is the handsomest princess I have ever seen; but I don't know whether our king will have a liking for her.' 'Liking for my daughter!' said the queen.' You have only to paint her to him as she is, and he is sure to turn mad with love. To be serious, Sivalu, I am anxious to get my daughter married. Many princes have sought her hand, but I am unwilling to give her to any of them, as they are not the sons of great kings. But your king seems to be a great king. I can have no objection to making him my son-in-law.' The queen sent word to the king, requesting him to come and see the jackal. The king came and saw the jackal, heard him describe the wealth and pomp of the king of his country, and expressed himself not unwilling to give away his daughter in marriage to him. The jackal after this returned to the weaver and said to him, 'O lord of the loom, you are the luckiest man in the world. It is all settled; you are to become the son-in-law of a great king. I have told them that you are yourself a great king, and you must behave yourself as one. You must do just as I instruct you. otherwise your fortune will not only not be made, but both you and I will be put to death.' 'I'll do just as you bid me,' said the weaver. The shrewd jackal drew in his own mind a plan of the method of procedure he should adopt, and after a few days went back to the palace of the king in the same manner in which he had gone before, that is to say, chewing betel-leaves and lying down at the entrance of the tank on the premises of the palace. The king and queen were glad to see him, and eagerly asked him as to the success of his mission. The jackal said, 'In order to relieve your minds I may tell you at once that my mission has teen so far successful. If you only knew the infinite trouble I have had in persuading his Majesty, my sovereign, to make up his mind to marry your daughter, you would give me no end of thanks. For a long time he would not hear of it, but gradually I brought him round. You have now only to fix an auspicious day for the celebration of the solemn rite. There is one bit of advice, however, which I, as your friend, would give you. It is this. My master is so great a king that if he were to come to you in state, attended by all his followers, his horses and his elephants, you would find it impossible to accommodate them all in your palace or in your city. I would therefore propose that our king should come to your city, not in state, but in a private manner; and that you send to the outskirts of your city your own elephants, horses, and conveyances, to bring him and only a few of his followers to your palace.' 'Many thanks, wise Sivalu, for this advice. I could not possibly make accommodation in my city for the followers of so great a king as your master is. I should be very glad if he did not come in state; and trust you will use your influence to persuade him to come in a private manner; for I should be ruined if he came in state.' The jackal then gravely said, 'I will do my best in the matter,' and then returned to his own village, after the royal astrologer had fixed an auspicious day for the wedding. On his return the jackal busied himself with making preparations for the great ceremony. As the weaver was clad in tatters, he told him to go to the washermen of the village and borrow from them a suit of clothes. As for himself, he went to the king of his race, and told him that on a certain day he would like one thousand jackals to accompany him to a certain place. He went to the king of crows, and begged that his corvine majesty would be pleased to allow one thousand of his black subjects to accompany him on a certain day to a certain place. He preferred a similar petition to the king of paddy-birds. At last the great day arrived. The weaver arrayed himself in the clothes which he had borrowed from the village washermen. The jackal made his appearance, accompanied by a train of a thousand jackals, a thousand crows, and a thousand paddy-birds. The nuptial procession started on their journey, and towards sundown arrived within two miles of the king's palace. There the jackal told his friends, the thousand jackals, to set up a loud howl; at his bidding the thousand crows cawed their loudest; while the hoarse screechings of the thousand paddy-birds furnished a suitable accompaniment. The effect may be imagined. They all together made a noise the like of which had never been heard since the world began. While this unearthly noise was going on, the jackal himself hastened to the palace, and asked the king whether he thought he would be able to accommodate the wedding-party, which was about two miles distant, and whose noise was at that moment sounding in his ears. The king said 'Impossible, Sivalu; from the sound of the procession I infer there must be at least one hundred thousand souls. How is it possible to accommodate so many guests? Please, so arrange that the bridegroom only will come to my house.' 'Very well,' said the jackal; 'I told you at the beginning that you would not be able to accommodate all the attendants of my august master. I'll do as you wish. My master will alone come in undress. Send a horse for the purpose.' The jackal, accompanied by a horse and groom, came to the place where his friend the weaver was, thanked the thousand jackals, the thousand crows and the thousand paddy-birds, for their valuable services, and told them all to go away, while he himself, and the weaver on horseback, wended their way to the king's palace. The bridal party, waiting in the palace, were greatly disappointed at the personal appearance of the weaver; but the jackal told them that his master had purposely put on a mean dress, as his would-be father-in-law declared himself unable to accommodate the bride groom and his attendants coming in state. The royal priests now began the interesting ceremony, and the nuptial knot was tied for ever. The bridegroom seldom opened his lips, agreeably to the instructions of the jackal, who was afraid lest his speech should betray him. At night when he was lying in bed he began to count the beams and rafters of the room, and said audibly, 'This beam will make a first-rate loom, that other a capital beam, and that yonder an excellent sley.' The princess, his bride, was not a little astonished. She began to think in her mind, 'Is the man, to whom they have tied me, a king or a weaver? I am afraid he is the latter; otherwise why should he be talking of weaver's loom, beam, and sley? Ah, me! Is this what the fates kept in store for me?' In the morning the princess related to the queen-mother the weaver's soliloquy. The king and queen, not a little surprised at this recital, took the jackal to task about it. The ready-witted jackal at once said, 'Your Majesty need not be surprised at my august master's soliloquy. His palace is surrounded by a population of seven hundred families of the best weavers in the world, to whom he has given rent-free lands, and whose welfare he continually seeks. It must have been in one of his philanthropic moods that he uttered the soliloquy which has taken your Majesty by surprise.' The jackal, however, now felt that it was high time for himself and the weaver to decamp with the princess, since the proverbial simplicity of his friend of the loom might any moment involve him in danger. The jackal therefore represented to the king, that weighty affairs of state would not permit his august master to spend another day in the palace; that he should start for his kingdom that very day with his bride; and his master was resolved to travel incognito on foot, only the princess, now the queen, should leave the city in a palki. After a great deal of yea and nay, the king and queen at last consented to the proposal. The party came to the outskirts of the weaver's village. The palki hearers were sent away; and the princess, who asked where her husband's palace was, was made to walk on foot. The weaver's hut was soon reached, and the jackal, addressing the princess, said, 'This, madam, is your husband's palace.' The princess began to beat her forehead with the palms of her hands in sheer despair. 'Ah, me! Is this the husband whom Prajapati [the god who presides over marriages] intended for me? Death would have been a thousand times better.' As there was nothing for it, the princess soon got reconciled to her fate. She, however, determined to make her husband rich, especially as she knew the secret of becoming rich. One day she told her husband to get for her a pice-worth of flour. She put a little water in the flour, and smeared her body with the paste. When the paste dried on her body, she began wiping the paste with her fingers; and as the paste fell in small balls from her body, it got turned into gold. She repeated this process every day for some time, and thus got an immense quantity of gold. She soon became mistress of more gold than is to be found in the coffers of any king. With this gold she employed a whole army of masons, carpenters and architects, who in no time built one of the finest palaces in the world. Seven hundred families of weavers were sought for and settled round about the palace. After this she wrote a letter to her father to say that she was sorry he had not favored her with a visit since the day of her marriage, and that she would be delighted if he now came to see her and her husband. The king agreed to come, and a day was fixed. The princess made great preparations against the day of her father's arrival. Hospitals were established in several parts of the town for diseased, sick, and infirm animals. The beasts in thousands were made to chew betel-leaves on the wayside. The streets were covered with Cashmere shawls for her father and his attendants to walk on. There was no end of the display of wealth and grandeur. The king and queen arrived in state, and were infinitely delighted at the apparently bound less riches of their son-in-law. The jackal now appeared on the scene, and saluting the king and queen, said -- 'Did I not tell you?'", "title": "The Match-Making Jackal", "id": 545}
{"label": "275", "text": "This story was actually made up, young ones, but it really is true, for my grandfather, who told it to me, always said whenever he told it, 'it must be true, my son, otherwise it couldn't be told.' Anyway, this is how the story goes: It was on a Sunday morning at harvest time, just when the buckwheat was in bloom. The sun was shining bright in the heaven, the morning wind was blowing warmly across the stubble, the larks were singing in the air, the bees were buzzing in the buckwheat, and the people in their Sunday best were on their way to church, and all the creatures were happy, including the hedgehog. The hedgehog was standing before his door with his arms crossed, humming a little song to himself, neither better nor worse than hedgehogs usually sing on a nice Sunday morning. Singing there to himself, half silently, it suddenly occurred to him that while his wife was washing and drying the children, he could take a little walk into the field and see how his turnips were doing. The turnips were close by his house, and he and his family were accustomed to eating them, so he considered them his own. No sooner said than done. The hedgehog closed the house door behind him and started down the path to the field. He hadn't gone very far away from his house at all, only as far as the blackthorn bush which stands at the front of the field, near the turnip patch, when he met up with the hare, who had gone out for a similar purpose, namely to examine his cabbage. When the hedgehog saw the hare, he wished him a friendly good morning. The hare, however, who was in his own way a distinguished gentleman, and terribly arrogant about it, did not answer the hedgehog's greeting, but instead said to the hedgehog, in a terribly sarcastic manner, 'How is it that you are running around in the field so early in the morning?' 'I'm taking a walk,' said the hedgehog. 'Taking a walk?' laughed the hare. 'I should think that you could better use your legs for other purposes.' This answer made the hedgehog terribly angry, for he could stand anything except remarks about his legs, for by nature they were crooked. 'Do you imagine,' said the hedgehog to the hare, 'that you can accomplish more with your legs?' 'I should think so,' said the hare. 'That would depend on the situation,' said the hedgehog. 'I bet, if we were to run a race, I'd pass you up.' 'That is a laugh! You with your crooked legs!' said the hare. 'But for all I care, let it be, if you are so eager. What will we wager?' 'A gold louis d'or and a bottle of brandy,' said the hedgehog. 'Accepted,' said the hare. 'Shake hands, and we can take right off.' 'No, I'm not in such a hurry,' said the hedgehog. 'I'm very hungry. First I want to go home and eat a little breakfast. I'll be back here at this spot in a half hour.' The hare was agreeable with this, and the hedgehog left. On his way home the hedgehog thought to himself, 'The hare is relying on his long legs, but I'll still beat him. He may well be a distinguished gentleman, but he's still a fool, and he'll be the one to pay.' Arriving home, he said to his wife, 'Wife, get dressed quickly. You've got to go out to the field with me.' 'What's the matter?' said his wife. 'I bet a gold louis d'or and a bottle of brandy with the hare that I could beat him in a race, and you should be there too.' 'My God, man,' the hedgehog's wife began to cry, 'are you mad? Have you entirely lost your mind? How can you agree to run a race with the hare?' 'Hold your mouth, woman,' said the hedgehog. 'This is my affair. Don't get mixed up in men's business. Hurry up now, get dressed, and come with me.' What was the hedgehog's wife to do? She had to obey, whether she wanted to or not. As they walked toward the field together, the hedgehog said to his wife, 'Now pay attention to what I tell you. You see, we are going to run the race down the long field. The hare will run in one furrow and I in another one. We'll begin running from up there. All you have to do is to stand here in the furrow, and when the hare approaches from the other side, just call out to him, 'I'm already here.'' With that they arrived at the field, the hedgehog showed his wife her place, then he went to the top of the field. When he arrived the hare was already there. 'Can we start?' said the hare. 'Yes, indeed,' said the hedgehog. 'On your mark!' And each one took his place in his furrow. The hare counted 'One, two, three,' and he tore down the field like a windstorm. But the hedgehog ran only about three steps and then ducked down in the furrow and remained there sitting quietly. When the hare, in full run, arrived at the bottom of the field, the hedgehog's wife called out to him, 'I'm already here!' The hare, startled and bewildered, thought it was the hedgehog himself, for as everyone knows, a hedgehog's wife looks just like her husband. The hare thought, 'Something's not right here.' He called out, 'Let's run back again!' And he took off again like a windstorm, with his ears flying from his head. But the hedgehog's wife remained quietly in place. When the hare arrived at the top, the hedgehog called out to him, 'I'm already here!' The hare, beside himself with excitement, shouted, 'Let's run back again!' 'It's all right with me,' answered the hedgehog. 'For all I care, as often as you want.' So the hare ran seventy-three more times, and the hedgehog always kept up with him. Each time the hare arrived at the top or the bottom of the field, the hedgehog or his wife said, 'I am already here!' But the hare did not complete the seventy-fourth time. In the middle of the field, with blood flowing from his neck, he fell dead to the ground. The hedgehog took the gold louis d'or and the bottle of brandy he had won, called his wife from her furrow, and happily they went back home. And if they have not died, then they are still alive. Thus it happened that the hedgehog ran the hare to death on the Buxtehude Heath, and since that time no hare has agreed to enter a race with a hedgehog. The moral of this story is, first, that no one, however distinguished he thinks himself, should make fun of a lesser man, even if this man is a hedgehog. And second, when a man marries, it is recommended that he take a wife from his own class, one who looks just like him. In other words, a hedgehog should always take care that his wife is also a hedgehog, and so forth. Hase und der Igel,' Kinder- und Hausm\u00c3\u00a4rchen, no. 187. (1853).

{"label": "700", "text": "A Prayer to the Empress Jingo An old married couple went to the shrine of the deified Empress Jingo, and prayed that they might be blessed with a child, even if it were no bigger than one of their fingers. A voice was heard from behind the bamboo curtain of the shrine, and the old people were informed that their wish would be granted. In due time the old woman gave birth to a child, and when she and her husband discovered that this miniature piece of humanity was no bigger than a little finger, they became extremely angry, and thought that the Empress Jingo had treated them very meanly indeed, though, as a matter of fact, she had fulfilled their prayer to the letter. 'One-Inch Priest' The little fellow was called Issunboshi ('One-Inch Priest'), and every day his parents expected to see him suddenly grow up as other boys; but at thirteen years of age he still remained the same size as when he was born. Gradually his parents became exasperated, for it wounded their vanity to hear the neighbours describe their son as Little Finger, or Grain-of-Corn. They were so much annoyed that at last they determined to send Issunboshi away. The little fellow did not complain. He requested his mother to give him a needle, a small soup-bowl, and a chop-stick, and with these things he set off on his adventures. Issunboshi becomes a Page His soup-bowl served as a boat, which he propelled along the river with his chop-stick. In this fashion he finally reached Kyoto. Issunboshi wandered about this city until he saw a large roofed gate. Without the least hesitation he walked in, and having reached the porch of a house, he cried out in a very minute voice: 'I beg an honourable inquiry!' Prince Sanjo himself heard the little voice, and it was some time before he could discover where it came from. When he did so he was delighted with his discovery, and on the little fellow begging that he might live in the prince's house, his request was readily granted. The boy became a great favourite, and was at once made the Princess Sanjo's page. In this capacity he accompanied his mistress everywhere, and though so very small, he fully appreciated the honour and dignity of his position. An Encounter with Oni One day the Princess Sanjo and her page went to the Temple of Kwannon, the Goddess of Mercy, 'under whose feet are dragons of the elements and the lotuses of purity' As they were leaving the temple two oni (evil spirits) sprang upon them. Issunboshi took out his needle-sword from its hollow straw, and loudly denouncing the oni, he flourished his small weapon in their evil-looking faces. One of the creatures laughed. 'Why,' said he scornfully, 'I could swallow you, as a cormorant swallows a trout, and what is more, my funny little bean-seed, I will do so.' The oni opened his mouth, and Issunboshi found himself slipping down a huge throat until he finally stood in the creature's great dark stomach. Issunboshi, nothing daunted, began boring away with his needle-sword. This made the evil spirit cry out and give a great cough, which sent the little fellow into the sunny world again. The second oni, who had witnessed his companion's distress, was extremely angry, and tried to swallow the remarkable little page, but was not successful. This time Issunboshi climbed up the creature's nostril, and when he had reached the end of what seemed to him to be a very long and gloomy tunnel, he began piercing the oni's eyes. The creature, savage with pain, ran off as fast as he could, followed by his yelling companion. Needless to say, the princess was delighted with her page's bravery, and told him that she was sure her father would reward him when he was told about the terrible encounter. The Magic Mallet On their way home the princess happened to pick up a small wooden mallet. 'Oh!' said she, 'this must have been dropped by the wicked oni, and it is none other than a lucky mallet. You have only to wish and then tap it upon the ground, and your wish, no matter what, is always granted. My brave Issunboshi, tell me what you would most desire, and I will tap the mallet on the ground.' After a pause the little fellow said: 'Honourable Princess, I should like to be as big as other people.' The princess tapped the mallet on the ground, calling aloud the wish of her page. In a moment Issunboshi was transformed from a bijou creature to a lad just like other youths of his age. These wonderful happenings excited the curiosity of the emperor, and Issunboshi was summoned to his presence. The emperor was so delighted with the youth that he gave him many gifts and made him a high official. Finally, Issunboshi became a great lord and married Prince Sanjo's youngest daughter.", "title": "The Transformation of Issunboshi", "id": 547}
{"label": "958E*", "text": "In former times thieves made lights for themselves which had the power to keep the inhabitants of a house asleep as long as the lights were burning. If the rogues knew how many people there were in the house that they wanted to rob, then they would ignite that number of lights, and no one would be able to wake up as long as the lights were burning. These lights were made from unborn children which had been cut from the womb. Therefore it occurred not infrequently that pregnant women were sold to bandits for high prices. That very thing happened once at a mill. A servant girl who was pregnant worked for the miller. Her fianc\u00c3\u00a9 came to visit her one night. He saw a wagon standing before the door of the miller's house. It was covered with a tarp. He heard a stifled groaning sound coming from beneath the tarp. The servant rushed to the living-room window, and inside he saw several fellows with the miller. They were counting out a large pile of silver coins onto the table. The servant immediately became suspicious and rushed back to investigate the wagon. He pulled his own fianc\u00c3\u00a9e from beneath the wagon tarp. Her mouth had been bound with a cloth. The servant carried her to safety and then untied her hands and feet. The robbers soon emerged from the house and drove off as fast as their horses could run, thinking that they were carrying with them a rich booty. Once a rogue slipped into a house during the day. The inhabitants of the house saw him, but although they searched high and low, they could not find him. At nightfall the inhabitants went to bed, but the servant girl could not fall asleep. She was afraid of the stranger, and wanted to look around carefully one last time. To her fright she discovered him hiding in the stove. The girl then pretended to fall asleep. Now that all was quiet in the house, the rogue climbed out of the stove and ignited as many lights as there were people in the house. But one of the lights would not burn. He believed that the girl was not yet asleep and held a burning light against her feet. However, in her fear she withstood the pain and did not move. Now satisfied, the rogue placed all the lights on the table and went outside to summon his fellow robbers. The girl jumped up and barred the door shut behind him. She attempted to awaken the people in the house, but to no avail. She then tried to extinguish the lights, but failed to do this as well. The rogue came to the window and demanded his lights, promising to leave once he had them. The servant girl answered that she could not reach them out to him while there were burning. She said that she had been unable to put them out and asked him what to do. He told her to submerge them in fresh milk. That is exactly what she wanted to know. She submerged them in fresh milk, and the lights went out. She shouted at the fellow that he was not going to get his lights back, and he then did indeed have to made a hasty retreat, for as soon as the lights were extinguished, everyone in the house awoke, and they all came running to see what was the matter.", "title": "Thieves' Lights (Bartsch)", "id": 548}
{"label": "1365", "text": "There was once a farmer who was married to the most contrary wife in the world. Her name was Maya. If he expected Maya to say, 'Yes,' she would always say, 'No,' and if he expected her to say, 'No,' she would always say, 'Yes.' If he said the soup was too hot, Maya would instantly insist that it was too cold. She would do nothing that he wanted her to do, and she always insisted on doing everything that he did not want her to do. Like most contrary people Maya was really very stupid and the farmer after he had been married to her for a few years knew exactly how to manage her. For instance at Christmas one year he wanted to make a big feast for his friends and neighbors. Did he tell his wife so? Not he! Instead, a few weeks beforehand he remarked casually: 'Christmas is coming and I suppose every one will expect us to have fine white bread. But I don't think we ought to. It's too expensive. Black bread is good enough for us.' 'Black bread, indeed!' cried Maya. 'Not at all! We're going to have white bread and you needn't say any more about it! Black bread at Christmas! To hear you talk people would suppose we are beggars!' The farmer pretended to be grieved and he said: 'Well, my dear, have white bread if your heart is set on it, but I hope you don't expect to make any pies.' 'Not make any pies! Just let me tell you I expect to make all the pies I want!' 'Well, now, Maya, if we have pies I don't think we ought to have any wine.' 'No wine! I like that! Of course we'll have wine on Christmas!' The farmer was much pleased but, still pretending to protest, he said: 'Well, if we spend money on wine, we better not expect to buy any coffee.' 'What! No coffee on Christmas! Who ever heard of such a thing! Of course we'll have coffee!' 'Well, I'm not going to quarrel with you! Get a little coffee if you like, but just enough for you and me for I don't think we ought to have any guests.' 'What! No guests on Christmas! Indeed and you're wrong if you think we're not going to have a houseful of guests!' The farmer was overjoyed but, still pretending to grumble, he said: 'If you have the house full of people, you needn't think I'm going to sit at the head of the table, for I'm not!' 'You are, too!' screamed his wife. 'That's exactly where you are going to sit!' 'Maya, Maya, don't get so excited! I will sit there if you insist. But if I do you mustn't expect me to pour the wine.' 'And why not? It would be a strange thing if you didn't pour the wine at your own table !' 'All right, all right, I'll pour it! But you mustn't expect me to taste it beforehand.' 'Of course you're going to taste it beforehand!' This was exactly what the farmer wanted his wife to say. So you see by pretending to oppose her at every turn he was able to have the big Christmas party that he wanted and he was able to feast to his heart's content with all his friends and relatives and neighbors. Time went by and Maya grew more and more contrary if such a thing were possible. Summer came and the haymaking season. They were going to a distant meadow to toss hay and had to cross an angry little river on a footbridge made of one slender plank. The farmer crossed in safety, then he called back to his wife: 'Walk very carefully, Maya, for the plank is not strong!' 'I will not walk carefully!' the wife declared. She flung herself on the plank with all her weight and when she got to the middle of the stream she jumped up and down just to show her husband how contrary she could be. Well, the plank broke with a snap, Maya fell into the water, the current carried her off, and she was drowned! Her husband, seeing what had happened, ran madly upstream shouting: 'Help! Help!' The haymakers heard him and came running to see what was the matter. 'My wife has fallen into the river!' he cried, 'and the current has carried her body away!' 'What ails you?' the haymakers said. 'Are you mad? If the current has carried your wife away, she's floating downstream, not upstream!' 'Any other woman would float downstream,' the farmer said. 'Yes! But you know Maya! She's so contrary she'd float upstream every time!' 'That's true,' the haymakers said, 'she would!' So all afternoon the farmer searched upstream for his wife's body but he never found it. When night came he went home and had a good supper of all the things he liked to eat which Maya would never let him have.", "title": "Mary, Mary, So Contrary [The Pig-Headed Wife]", "id": 549}
{"label": "1645", "text": "There was of old time in the city of Cairo a man called Numan, and he had a son. One day when this boy's time to learn to read was fully come he took him to a school and gave to a teacher. This Numan was exceeding poor, so that he followed the calling of a water seller, and in this way he supported his wife and child. When the teacher had made the boy read through the Koran, he told the boy to fetch him his present. So the boy came and told his father. His father said, 'O son, the Koran is the Word of God Most High, we have nothing worthy of it; there is our camel with which I follow my trade of water seller, take it at least and give it to thy teacher.' The boy took the camel and brought it to his teacher. But that day his father could gain no money, and that night his wife and his son and himself remained hungry. Now his wife was a great scold, and when she saw this thing she said, 'Out on thee, husband, art thou mad? Where are thy senses gone? Thou hadst a camel, and by means of it we made shift to live, and now thou hast taken and given it in a present; would that that boy had not been born, or that thou hadst not sent him to read; what is he and what his reading?' And she made so much noise and clamor that it cannot be described. Numan saw this thing, and he bowed down his head, and from the greatness of his distress he fell asleep. In his dream a radiant elder, white-bearded and clad in white raiment, came and said, 'O Numan, thy portion is in Damascus; go, take it.' Just then Numan awoke and he saw no one, and he arose and said, 'Is the vision divine or is it satanic?' While saying this, he again fell asleep, and again he saw it. Brief, the elder appeared three times to him that night in his dream and said, 'Indeed is thy provision in Damascus; delay not, go to Damascus and take it.' When it was morning Numan spake to his wife of the vision; his wife said, 'Thou gavest away our camel and didst leave us hungry, and now thou canst not abide our complaints and wishest to run off; I fear thou wilt leave thy child and me here and go off.' Numan said, 'My life, I will not run off.' Quoth the woman, 'I will not bide, I will not bide; where thou goest I too will go with thee.' Numan sware that he would not run off, and the woman was persuaded and let him go. So Numan went forth; and one day he entered Damascus, and he went in through the gate of the Amawi Mosque. That day someone had baked bread in an oven and was taking it to his house; when he saw Numan opposite him and knew him to be a stranger, he gave him a loaf. Numan took it and ate it, and lay down through fatigue and fell asleep. That elder again came to him in his vision and said, '0 Numan, thou hast received thy provision; delay not, go back to thy house.' Numan awoke and was amazed and said, 'Then our bearing this much trouble and weariness was for a loaf.' And he returned. One day he entered his house, and the woman looked and saw there was nothing in his hand; and Numan told her. When the woman learned that Numan had brought nothing, she turned and said, 'Out on thee, husband, thou art become mad, thou art a worthless man; had thy senses been in thy head, thou hadst not given away our camel, the source of our support, and left us thus friendless and hungry and thirsty; not a day but thou doest some mad thing.' And she complained much. And Numan's heart was broken by the weariness of the road and the complaining of the woman, and he fell asleep. Again in his vision that elder came and said, 'O Numan, delay not, arise, dig close by thee, thy provision is there, take it.' But Numan heeded not. Three times the elder appeared to him in his dream and said, 'Thy provision is indeed close by thee; arise, take it.' So Numan, unable to resist, arose and took a pick-axe and shovel and began to dig where his head had lain. The woman made mock of Numan and said, 'Out on thee, man; the half of the treasure revealed to thee is mine.' Numan replied, 'So be it; but I am weary, come thou and dig a bit that I may take breath a little.' The woman said, 'Thou art not weary now; when thou art weary I will help.' Numan went on: and when he had dug as deep as half the height of a man, a marble slab appeared. The woman saw the marble and, saying in herself, 'This is not empty,' she asked the pick-axe from Numan. Numan said, 'Have patience a little longer.' The woman said, 'Thou art weary.' Numan replied, 'Now am I rested.' Quoth the woman, 'I am sorry for thee, thou dost not know kindness.' While thus talking they saw that one side of that marble was pierced and that there was a hole. Thereupon grew Numan eager, and he pulled the marble from its place, and below it was a well and a ladder. He caught hold of the ladder and went down and saw a royal vase filled full with red gold, and he called out to the woman, 'Come here.' Thereupon the woman descended likewise and saw the vase of gold, and she threw her arms round Numan's neck and said, 'O my noble little husband! Blessed be God, for thy luck and thy fortune.' Numan took up some of these sequins, and the woman said, 'What wilt thou do?' Numan replied, 'I shall take these to our king and tell him that there is a vase full of them, and that an elder came to me in my dream and told me, and I shall say, 'Take them all; and, if thou wilt, bestow on me a few of them that I and my wife may eat and drink, and in our comfort may bless and praise thee.'' Quoth the woman, 'My life, husband, speak not to our king now, so that all of them may remain ours and we shall have ease of heart.' Numan listened not, but took them and laid them before the king. The king said, 'What is this?' Numan answered, 'O king, I found them in thy ground.' And he told of the elder's coming in his dream and of there being a vase full of them, and said, 'O king, send a slave of thine, and he will return; and I shall accept the king's alms, whatever it may be.' The king said to a scribe, 'Come, read this, let us see from whose time it has remained.' When the scribe took the sequin into his hand he saw that there was written on the one side of it, 'This is an alms from before God to Numan.' Then the scribe turned over the other side and saw that it was thus written on that side, 'By reason of his respect toward the Koran.' When the scribe had read the inscriptions to the king, the king said, 'What is thy name?' He replied, 'My name is Numan.' The king caused all these sequins to be read, and the writing on the whole of them was the same. The king said, 'Go ye and bring some from the bottom of the vase.' And they went and brought some from the bottom of the vase, and they read them, and they all bore the inscription of the first. And the king wondered and said, 'Go, poor man, God Most High has given it thee, on my part too be it lawful for thee; come, take these sequins also.' So Numan took them and went to his house, and he took out the sequins that were in the vase; and he enjoyed delight in the world until he died, and in the hereafter he attained a lofty station. And all this felicity was for his respect to the glorious Koran.", "title": "Numan's Dream", "id": 550}

{"label": "613", "text": "One day two peasants were conversing; one of them was boastful and untruthful, the other famed for truthfulness and honesty. The one was saying that it was better to live, telling lies and cheating everybody, and be rich; while the other replied that it was far better to live in poverty, as long as you were honest and truthful. So they began to dispute and quarrel, neither of them wishing to give in. They at last decided to go out into the village high-road, and ask the opinion of the very first person they met. They walked and walked, and soon saw a peasant plowing in a field close to the road; they went up to him, and said, 'Good man, judge our quarrel: how is it better to live in the wide world -- honestly or dishonestly? -- telling the truth or by telling lies?' 'Ah, my brothers, you cannot possibly live honestly in this world all your life! You must tell a lie now and then! Besides, an honest and truthful man must walk about all his life in straw shoes, while a liar and a dishonest man can walk in handsome boots. Take us, for example, our masters unjustly take our days from us, leaving no time for us to work in. [Footnote: The serfs were allowed three days in the week to work for themselves, while the other three days belonged to their masters.] We therefore have to pretend that we are overcome by sickness, and during that time go wood-cutting in the forest; if wood-cutting is forbidden by day, we go at night. We have always to dodge about in this world, my friends. We could not possibly get on otherwise.' 'Do you hear that?' said the liar to the honest man. 'What I told you was perfectly true!' But his companion would not be convinced, so they walked on farther, till they came across a merchant driving a wagon. 'Stop for a moment, good sir!' they cried. 'We want you to do us a favor, if you will not resent it, and promise not to be angry with us.' 'What is it?' 'We want you to decide our quarrel, and tell us whether it is better to live honestly in this world or dishonestly?' 'Ah, my children! it is difficult to live honestly. For my part, I think it is best to be dishonest; people cheat us, so why should we not cheat them?' 'You hear!' cried the liar to his companion. 'This good man is of my opinion, like the other.' Still the truthful man would not listen to his friend, so they went on farther and met a noble coming along the road. They stopped him, and said, 'Kindly judge our quarrel for us; how is it best to live in this world, honestly or dishonestly?' 'Well, you certainly have found something to quarrel about. You must have been very hard pressed for conversation. Of course, being dishonest is the only way to get on. What honesty and truthfulness is there in this world? You get sent to Siberia if you are honest and tell the truth!' 'You see, my friend, I am right after all!' said the liar.' Everyone thinks as I do, that it is better to live dishonestly.' 'No,' said the truthful man, ' it is not better, and I do not intend to live dishonestly, to please any one. If any misfortunes happen to me -- well, let them!' After this the two men went off in search of work; they journeyed on together for some time. The dishonest man always knowing how to adapt himself to the company he was in, wherever he went he had plenty to eat and drink and nothing to pay; while the honest man had to work for every drop of water and morsel of bread he got -- yet he did not grumble; he was perfectly satisfied. The dishonest man meanwhile laughed to himself as he watched his companion. When they had at last passed the village and reached the open country, where there were no inns or houses of any kind, the honest man became very hungry, and asked his companion to give him a morsel of bread, for he had plenty. 'But what will you give me for the bread?' 'Take whatever you like, though I have not much to lose.' 'Well, then, let me put out your eye!' 'Very well, put it out!' The horrid man did so, and gave him a very small piece of bread in return. They went on and on, until the honest man again became hungry, and asked his friend for another piece of bread. 'Very well, on condition that you let me knock out your other eye!' 'But if you do that, brother, I shall be blind!' 'Well, what matters, you are an honest, truthful man, you ought not to mind!' 'Well, if it must be so, it must! One cannot put up with hunger. If you are not afraid of committing the sin, knock out my eye and be happy.' The wretch did so, and giving his unfortunate companion a still smaller piece of bread than the first, left him in the middle of the deserted country road, and said, 'Go, find your way by yourself. I am not going to lead a blind man about!' After having eaten his piece of bread, the blind man felt his way along. 'Perhaps,' thought he, 'I may manage to find my way to the next village.' But he soon lost his way, and did not know where to go. He stopped, and throwing himself on his knees, began to pray to the saints to help him. 'Do not forsake me, miserable sinner that I am!' he cried. He prayed and prayed for a long time, and then heard a voice quite close to him saying, 'Turn to your right, good man, and you will come to a forest where you will hear the murmur of a fountain; feel your way to it, bathe your eyes in the clear water, and your eyesight will be restored. You will then see a large oak tree, climb up into it, and stop there through the night.' The blind man turned to the right, and with some difficulty reached the forest. He crawled along a path which soon brought him up to the murmuring fountain, and dipping his hands into the water, he began bathing his eyes. No sooner had he done so when his eyesight returned, and he was able to look about him once more. Not very far from the fountain stood an old oak tree, under which the grass seemed to have been greatly trampled down, and the earth around was dug up here and there and scattered about everywhere. He climbed up into the tree and waited until nightfall. At about midnight a number of evil spirits came flying down from all sides on to the trampled grass, and began boasting about what they had done and where they had been. One little devil said, 'I went to the beautiful princess, the king's daughter, and tormented her all day. I have gone on tormenting her for over ten years, and no one can cast me out, though many a handsome prince has tried, but all in vain; and, between ourselves, no one will ever succeed unless some fellow obtains that large image of the Virgin Mary, which is in the possession of a certain wealthy merchant; but then no one would ever think of that, and besides, if they did, the merchant would never part with it.' In the morning when all the devils had flown away, our friend the truthful man, who had heard the whole of the conversation, came down from his hiding place in the tree and went in search of the rich merchant. After inquiring everywhere, he at last found the merchant, and asked him to take him as a workman, saying, 'I will work hard for you for a whole year, but I want no wages. All I ask for is to have the famous image of the Virgin Mary which is in your possession.' The merchant consented, and the man worked away night and day, without a moment's rest, for he was very anxious to please his master. When the year was over he came to the merchant and asked for his reward. 'I am more than pleased with your work,' the merchant said; 'but I do not wish to part with the picture. Would not money do as well? You could have as much of it as you pleased, if that would satisfy you.' 'No; money would be of no use to me. Give me what you promised, and what you agreed upon when you took me.' 'It is hard for me to part with that picture; in fact, I don't know what I should do without it! Still, if you will work another year for me, I will give it to you.' There was no help for it, and the truthful man was obliged to consent. When the year was over, the merchant was again loath to part with the picture. 'I would rather reward you with all possible treasures,' the merchant said, 'than part with the picture; but if you are determined to have it, you must stop with me and work for another year.' It was difficult to argue with such a rich and influential man as the merchant; besides, it would not have been wise, under the circumstances. So our friend stayed and worked for his master another whole year, better and harder, if possible, than before. At the end of the third year the merchant actually took down the picture from the wall, and gave it to the man, saying, 'Take it, my good fellow, for you have worked so hard and so well, without ever grumbling, that I cannot refuse you this time; take it, and may the saints bless you.' The truthful man thanked the merchant, and taking the picture went to the king's palace, where the devil was tormenting the princess. 'I can cure the princess,' he said to the servants and people at court. When they heard this they seized him by the hands and brought him before the king, who was sitting on his throne, looking the picture of misery. The king at once had him taken to the room where the afflicted princess was kept. The man then asked for a large bowl of fresh water, into which he dipped the picture three times, and then bringing the water to the beautiful princess made her bathe her face in it. Hardly had she done so, when out sprang the demon, writhing until he became lifeless. When the enemy had expired, the lovely damsel became quite well and bright again. The king and queen were delighted, and did not know how they could best reward the good man who had proved such an excellent doctor. They wanted to ennoble him; they wanted to give him a quantity of all kinds of treasures and good things; but no, he would have nothing. 'I don't want anything,' he said. 'I shall marry him,' the princess whispered to her father, 'if he would care to have me!' 'Very well!' replied the king. As for our friend he did not object in the least, but was delighted. The wedding was then prepared, and the news immediately spread all over the kingdom, so that when the great day arrived there was quite a crowd to see the bride and bridegroom. From that day forth our friend, the truthful man, lived in the palace, was clad in royal garments, and dined at the king's table. Time passed, and our friend asked the king and queen to let him go and have a look at his own country. 'I have an old mother living in the village from which I come, and I want to see her again.' 'Let us go together,' said the princess. So they drove off in a lovely carriage and pair belonging to the king. They drove and drove, and on their way they met the wretch who had knocked out our friend's eyes. When the king's son-in-law saw him he stopped the carriage, and called out, 'How are you, my brother? Have you forgotten me? Do you not remember the quarrel we had together about honesty and dishonesty? and you knocking my eyes out because I did not agree with you.' The wretch began to tremble and did not know what to do or what to say. 'Do not be afraid, my friend,' said the other. ' I am not angry with you.' And then he began to explain everything to the dishonest man; how he had gone to the forest, and what he had heard there, and how he had worked three years for the rich merchant, and then received the picture of the Virgin Mary, and had at last married the king's beautiful daughter. When the dishonest man heard this, he thought he would also go into the forest and climb up the old oak tree. 'Perhaps,' said he to himself, 'I shall be just as fortunate as my friend!' So he went to the forest, found the murmuring fountain and the old oak tree, into which he climbed and waited until nightfall. At midnight the evil spirits again flew down from all sides on to the grass below; but this time they looked up, and seeing the dishonest man hiding in the tree, they seized him and tore him into a number of very small pieces.", "title": "Honesty and Dishonesty", "id": 552}

{"label": "311", "text": "'Ouch! Ouch!' the farmer cried. 'Let me go!' Wetehinen only held on more tightly. 'Yes, I'll let you go,' he said, 'but only on this condition: that you give me one of your daughters for wife!' 'Give you one of my daughters? Never!' 'Very well, then I'll never let go!' wicked old Wetehinen declared and with that he began jerking at the beard as if it were a bell rope. 'Wait! Wait!' the fanner spluttered. Now he didn't want to give one of his daughters to wicked old Wetehinen -- of course not! But at the same time he was in Wetehinen's power and he realized that if he didn't do what the old reprobate demanded he might lose his life and so leave all three of his daughters orphans. Perhaps for the good of all he had better sacrifice one of them. 'All right,' he said, 'let me go and I'll send you my oldest daughter. I promise.' So Wetehinen let go his beard and the farmer scrambled to his feet and hurried home. 'My dear,' he said to his oldest daughter, 'I left a bit of the harness down at the lake. Like a good girl will you run down and get it for me.' The eldest daughter went at once and when she reached the water's edge, old Wetehinen reached up and caught her about the waist and carried her down to the bottom of the lake where he lived in a big house. At first he was kind to her. He made her mistress of the house and gave her the keys to all the rooms and closets. He went very carefully over the keys and pointing to one he said, 'That key you must never use for it opens the door to a room which I forbid you to enter.' The eldest daughter began keeping house for old Wetehinen and spent her time cooking and cleaning and spinning much as she used to at home with her father. The days went by and she grew familiar with the house and began to know what was in every room and every closet. At first she felt no temptation to open the forbidden door. If old Wetehinen wanted to have a secret room, well and good. But why in the world had he given her the key if he really didn't want her to open the door? The more she thought about it the more she wondered. Every time she passed the room she stopped a moment and stared at the door. It looked just exactly like the doors that led into all the other rooms. 'I wonder why he doesn't want me to open just that door?' she kept asking herself. Finally one day when old Wetehinen was away she thought, 'I don't believe it would matter if I opened that door just a little crack and peeped in once! No one would know the difference!' For a few moments she hesitated, then mustered up courage enough to turn the key in the forbidden lock and throw open the door. The room was a storeroom with boxes and chests and old jars piled up around the wall. That was unexciting enough, but in the middle of the floor was something that made her start when she saw what it was. It was blood -- that's what it was, a pool of dark red blood! She was about to slam the door shut when she saw something else that made her pause. This was a lovely shining ring that lay in the midst of the pool. 'Oh!' she thought to herself, 'what a beautiful ring! If I had it I'd wear it on my finger!' The longer she looked at it, the more she wanted it. 'If I'm very careful,' she said, 'I know I could reach over and pick it up without touching the blood.' She tiptoed cautiously into the room, wrapped her skirts tightly about her legs, knelt down on the floor, and stretched her arm over the pool. She picked up the ring very carefully but even so she got a few drops of blood on her fingers. 'No matter!' she thought. 'I can wash that off! And see the lovely ring!' But later, after she had the door again locked, when she tried to wash the blood off, she found she couldn't. She tried soap, she tried sand, she tried everything she could think of, but without success. 'I don't care!' she thought to herself. 'If Wetehinen sees the blood, I'll just tell him I cut my finger by accident.' So when Wetehinen came home, she hid the ring and pretended nothing was the matter. After supper Wetehinen put his head in her lap and said, 'Now, my dear, scratch my head and make me drowsy for bed.' She began scratching his head as she had many nights before but, at the first touch of her fingers, he cried out, 'Stop! You're burning my ear! There must be some blood on your fingers! Let me see!' He reached up and caught her hand and, when he saw the blood stains, he flew into a towering rage. 'I thought so! You've been in the forbidden room!' He jumped up and without allowing her time to say a word he just cut off her head then and there with no more concern than if she had been a mosquito! After that he took the body and the severed head and threw them into the forbidden room and locked the door. 'Now then,' he growled, 'she won't disobey me again!' This was all very well but now he had no one to keep house for him and cook and scratch his head in the evening and soon he decided he'd have to get another wife. He remembered that the farmer had two more daughters, so he thought to himself that now he'd marry the second sister. He waited his chance and one day when the farmer was out in his boat fishing, old Wetehinen came up from the bottom of the lake and clutched the boat. When the poor old farmer tried to row back to shore he couldn't make the boat move an inch. He worked and worked at the oars and wicked old Wetehinen let him struggle until he was exhausted. Then he put his head up out of the water and over the side of the boat and as though nothing were the matter he said, 'Hullo!' 'Oh!' the farmer cried, wishing he were safe on shore, 'it's you, is it? I wondered what was holding my boat.' 'Yes,' wicked old Wetehinen said, 'it's me and I'm going to hold your boat right here on this spot until you promise to give me another of your daughters.' What could the farmer do? He pleaded with Wetehinen but Wetehinen was firm and the upshot was that before the farmer again walked dry land he had promised Wetehinen his second daughter. Well, when he got home, he pretended he had forgotten his ax in the boat and sent his second daughter down to the lake to get it. Wicked old Wetehinen caught her as he had caught her sister and carried her home with him to his house at the bottom of the lake. Wetehinen treated the second sister just exactly as he had the first, making her mistress of the house and telling her she might use every key but one. Like her sister she, too, after a time gave way to the temptation of looking into the forbidden room and when she saw the shining ring lying in the pool of blood of course she wanted it and of course when she reached to get it she dabbled her fingers in the blood. So that was the end of her, too, for wicked old Wetehinen when he saw the blood stains just cut her head right off and threw her body and the severed head into the forbidden room beside the body and head of her sister and locked the door. Time went by and the farmer was living happily with his youngest daughter when one day while he was out chopping wood he found a pair of fine birch bark brogues. He put them on and instantly found himself, walking away from the woods and down to the lake. He tried to stop but he couldn't. He tried to walk in another direction but the brogues carried him straight down to the water's edge and out into the lake until he was in waist deep. Then he heard a gruff voice saying, 'Hullo, there! What are you doing with my brogues?' Of course it was wicked old Wetehinen who had played that trick to get the farmer into his power again. 'What do you want this time?' the poor farmer cried. 'I want your youngest daughter,' Wetehinen said. 'What! My youngest daughter!' 'Yes.' 'I won't give her up!' the farmer declared. 'I don't care what you do to me. I won't give her up!' 'Oh, very well!' Wetehinen said, and immediately the brogues which had been standing still while they talked started walking again. They carried the farmer out into the lake farther and farther until the water was up to his chin. 'Wait -- wait a minute!' he cried. The brogues stopped walking and Wetehinen said, 'Well, do you promise to give her to me?' 'No!' the farmer began. 'She's my last daughter and -- ' Before he could say more, the brogues walked on and the water rose to his nose. In desperation he threw up his hands and shouted, 'I promise! I promise!' So when he got home that day he said to his youngest daughter whose name was Lisa, 'Lisa, my dear, I forgot my brogues at the lake. Like a good girl won't you run and get them for me?' So Lisa went to the lake and Wetehinen of course caught her and carried her down to his house as he had her two sisters. Then the same old story was repeated. Wetehinen made Lisa mistress of the house and gave her keys to all the doors and closets with the same prohibition against opening the door of the forbidden room. 'If I am mistress of the house,' Lisa said to herself, 'why should I not unlock every door?' She waited until one day when Wetehinen was away from home, then went boldly to the forbidden room, fitted the key in the lock, and flung open the door. There lay her two poor sisters with their heads cut off. There in the pool of blood sparkled the lovely ring, but Lisa paid no heed to it. 'Wicked old Wetehinen!' Lisa cried. 'I suppose he thinks that ring will tempt me, but nothing will tempt me to touch that awful blood!' Then she rummaged about, opening boxes and chests, and turning things over. In a dark corner she found two pitchers, one marked Water of Life, the other Water of Death. 'Ha! This is what I want!' she cried, taking the pitcher of the Water of Life. She set the severed heads of her sisters in place and then with the magic water brought them back to life. She used up all the Water of Life, so she filled the pitcher marked Water of Life with the water from the other pitcher, the Water of Death. She hid her sisters each in a big wooden chest, she shut and locked the door of the forbidden room, and Wetehinen when he came home found her working at her spinning wheel as though nothing unusual had happened. After supper Wetehinen said, 'Now scratch my head and make me drowsy for bed.' So Lisa scratched his wicked old head and she did it so well that he grunted with satisfaction. 'Uh! Uh!' he said. 'That's good! Now just behind my right ear! That's it! That's it! You're a good girl, you are! You're not like some of them who do what they're told not to do! Now behind the other ear! Oh, that's fine! Yes, you're a good girl, and if there's anything you want me to do just tell me what it is.' 'I want to send a chest of things to my poor old father,' Lisa said. 'Just a lot of little nothings -- odds and ends that I've picked up about the house. I'd be ashamed to have you open the chest and see them. I do wish you'd carry the chest ashore tomorrow and leave it where my father will find it.' 'All right, I will,' Wetehinen promised. He was true to his word. The next morning he hoisted one of the chests on his shoulder, the one that had in it the eldest sister. He trudged off with it, and tossed it up on shore at a place where he was sure the farmer would find it. Lisa then wheedled him into carrying up the second chest that had in it the second sister. This time Wetehinen wasn't so good-natured. 'I don't know what she can always be sending her father!' he grumbled. 'If she sends another chest I'll have to look inside and see.' Now Lisa, when the second sister was safely delivered, began to plan her own escape. She pulled out another empty chest and then one evening after she had succeeded in making old Wetehinen comfortable and drowsy she begged him to carry this also to her father. He grumbled and protested but finally promised. 'And you won't look inside, will you? Promise me you won't!' Lisa begged. Wetehinen said he wouldn't, but he intended to just the same. Well, the next morning as soon as Wetehinen went out, Lisa took the churn and dressed it up in some of her own clothes. She carried it to the top of the house and perched it on the ridge of the roof before a spinning wheel. Then she herself crept inside the third chest and waited. When Wetehinen came home he looked up and saw what he thought was Lisa spinning on the roof. 'Hullo!' he shouted. 'What are you doing up there?' Lisa, in the chest, answered in a voice that sounded as if it came from the roof: 'I'm spinning. And you, Wetehinen, my dear, don't forget the chest that you promised to carry to my poor old father. It's standing in the kitchen.' Wetehinen grumbled but because of his promise he hoisted the chest on his shoulder and started off. When he had gone a little way he thought to put it down and take a peep inside. Instantly Lisa's voice, sounding as if it came from the roof, cried out, 'No! No! You promised not to look inside!' 'I'm not looking inside!' Wetehinen called back. 'I'm only resting a minute!' Then he thought to himself, 'I suppose she's sitting up there so she can watch me!' When he had gone some distance farther, he thought again to set down the chest and open the lid but instantly Lisa's voice, as from a long way off, called out: 'No! No! You promised not to look inside!' 'Who's looking inside?' he called back, pretending again he was only resting. Every time he thought it would be safe to put down the chest and open the lid, Lisa's voice cried out: 'No! No! You promised not to !' 'Mercy on us!' old Wetehinen fumed to himself, 'who would have thought she could see so far!' On the shore of the lake when he threw down the chest in disgust he tried one last time to raise the lid. Instantly Lisa's voice cried out: 'No! No! You promised not to!' 'I'm not looking inside!' Wetehinen roared, and in a fury he left the chest and started back into the water. All the way home He grumbled and growled, 'A nice way to treat a man, always making him carry chests! I won't carry another one no matter how much she begs me!' When he came neat home he saw the spinning wheel still on the roof and the figure still seated before it. 'Why haven't you got my dinner ready?' he called out angrily. The figure at the spinning wheel made no answer. 'What's the matter with you?' Wetehinen cried. 'Why are you sitting there like a wooden image instead of cooking my dinner?' Still the figure made no answer and in a rage Wetehinen began climbing up the roof. He reached out blindly and clutched at Lisa's skirt and jerked it so hard that the churn came clattering down on his head. It knocked him off the roof and he fell all the way to the ground and cracked his wicked old head wide open. 'Ouch! Ouch!' he roared in pain. 'Just wait till I get hold of that Lisa!' He crawled to the forbidden room and poured over himself the water that was in the pitcher marked Water of Life. But it wasn't the Water of Life at all, it was the Water of Death, and so it didn't help his wicked old cracked head at all. In fact it just made it worse and worse and worse. Lisa and her sisters were never again troubled by him nor was any one else that lived on the shores of that lake. 'Wonder what's become of wicked old Wetehinen?' people began saying. Lisa thought she knew but she didn't tell.", "title": "The Three Chests: The Story of the Wicked Old Man of the Sea", "id": 554}

He said, 'We want to have a race between you and Hawk.' Mole said, 'When is the race to be run?' 'We wish to have it tomorrow.' Mole said, 'No, we cannot have it tomorrow. You must wait four days.' The day before the race they collected the stakes: beads, red and white, and turquoise. The night before, Mole went to the houses of the others (i.e., the other moles), and told them at different places, as Hawk should come along, to stick out their heads. Mole said, 'About that time urinate and wet yourselves, so that, when Hawk comes up and sees you, he will think you are sweating.' Mole went to his house and stayed there all night. Hawk staid in his house all night. The next day they brought the stakes into the plaza. When they had finished laying the bets, Mole said to Hawk, 'Which direction shall we take? I will go under ground, and you above ground.' Hawk said, 'Let us go by Matsakya, Tsililiima, Tekiapoi, Awiela, Alihemula, Kopachia, Telaluwaiela, Akiapoella, Kushinolko, Matsakya.' As soon as they started off, Mole went into his hole and staid in it. Hawk flew on to Tsililiima. There a mole poked out his head, and called out, 'Keep on! We are running together. Keep on as you are!' Then he went back underground. Hawk flew on to Tekiapoi. There another mole poked out his head, and called out, 'Keep on! We are running together. Keep on as you are!' Meanwhile Mole, he who made the bet, prayed to his father the sun, and the clouds began to gather. By the time Kopachia was reached and the mole there looked out of the hole, Hawk was behind. The mole waited. He said, 'If you don't make haste, I shall leave you behind.' By that time the rain was falling fast. When Hawk reached Telaluwaiela, he was wet through. At Akiapoella, Hawk was wobbling, he was drenched. The mole there said, 'You best make haste, I am leaving you far behind. I had to wait here for you a long time.' Hawk could hardly fly.

Soon afterward the son took himself a wife, who did not like the father. Spitefully she said, 'The old man is always coughing at the table until it takes away all my pleasure in eating.' So to please her, the son gave his father a place to lie beneath the stairs. For many years he lay there on a bed of hay and straw like one they would make for the dogs. The queen gave birth to a son, who grew into a proud and virtuous lad. Recognizing the situation, he brought whatever food and drink he could find to his grandfather. One day the grandfather asked for an old horse blanket to protect him from the cold, and the virtuous youth ran off to fulfill his wish. In the stall he found a good horse blanket. He took it from the horse and ripped it in two. Seeing him, his father asked him what he was doing with the horse blanket. 'I am taking half of it for your father's bed,' he said.

{"label": "1540", "text": "Twice each day, early in the morning and at evening, Fatima took a large copper vessel, and went to the river to bring fresh drinking-water to the house. Early one beautiful morning she went as usual to bring her kettle of fresh water. She sat down under a great mulberry-tree which overhung the river. It was full of ripe fruit which hung far above her head. As she sat there enjoying the beautiful early morning and looking up into the tree laden with fine fruit which she, being a girl, could not reach, since she could not climb the tree, she fell a-thinking. She thought how some day perhaps she would be married and perhaps would have a little son and his name would be Ali, and after a time he would grow to be eight years old, and that then he could go to the river to bring fresh water in the morning. Then she thought how, when Ali had come to the mulberry-tree, he would climb up into the tree to pluck the delicious berries, and how at last the poor little boy would fall from the tree into the river and be drowned. Then Fatima sprang up crying, 'Oh! Ali! Ali! My son! My son Ali!' And she ran home crying aloud, 'My son Ali, my son Ali is dead!' As she ran along the street the people came out calling to her and asking what was the matter. She did not stop, but ran on crying, 'Ali! Ali! My son Ali! My son Ali is dead!' until she reached her own home. Her mother, seeing the water vessel empty, and hearing her daughter crying aloud, said, 'What is the matter? Why are you weeping? Why have you brought no fresh water this morning?' Then the girl told her mother how she had sat under the mulberry- tree, and had thought that perhaps some day she would be married and would have a little son and his name would be Ali, and when he had come to be eight years old he would go to draw the water for the family, and he would see the ripe mulberries hanging from the tree and would climb the tree to gather them, and he would fall into the river and be drowned. And again she burst out, 'Oh! Ali! My son Ali! My son Ali is dead!' Then the mother also burst out crying, and the two sat there all day lamenting and weeping over the poor, drowned Ali. Late in the afternoon there came to the door begging bread a Chingana woman (gypsy). When she heard the great outcry and saw the two women weeping she asked, 'What is the matter?' The mother told her the story, how her daughter had gone to draw water from the river, had sat down under the mulberry-tree, and all that she had imagined, how she came home crying, and how ever since they had been grieving over the lost Ali. The gypsy said, 'I can tell you about your son, for you know my people can not only read the past and the future, but can see into the other world and tell what is going on there.' 'Oh,' cried Fatima, springing up. 'Can you give me some word of my son? Where is he? How is he? Is he happy? Is he well? How old is he?' And she stopped crying, and danced, laughing, about the room in expectation of hearing about her dear lost Ali. Then the cunning old Chingana said, 'I see your son. He is now about twelve years old. He is not well. He is very poor and hungry. If anyone should give him one piece of bread, he would be so glad that he would jump ten times for joy. He is lying down, faint and weak, wanting food; but if you will give me food I will carry it to him, and soon he will be well and strong.' Then the mother and daughter made themselves very busy preparing food to send by the Chingana woman to little Ali. Fatima hurried out to the shop to buy nuts and fruit. The mother brought some saddlebags, which they packed with bread and all kinds of delicacies. They also put in clothes that they thought a twelve-year-old boy could wear. By the time that all was ready the saddle-bags were so heavy that the Chingana said she could not carry them. She was very cunning, and as she had entered the house she had seen a fine horse standing in its stall at the side of the house. This horse belonged to Fatima's brother. The old woman said, 'Have you not a horse that you could lend me to ride upon to carry the saddlebags to your Ali, for he is suffering, and I should hasten to bear your presents to him.' 'Yes, yes,' cried Fatima and her mother. 'We have a horse,' and they hurried to lead forth the horse to the front of the house. The saddlebags were placed on the horse, and the old woman mounted and rode away. Not long after she left, Fatima's brother came home from his work. As he approached the house he heard great crying, for the women had again begun to weep after the departure of the Chingana. The brother heard his sister crying, 'Ali! Ali! My son Ali is dead!' He came in, saying, 'What is the matter? Where is my horse? Why are you crying like this?' Then Fatima and her mother together told him the sad story, how his sister had gone to the river to draw water, how she had sat under the tree and all she had imagined, and how she had come home crying, and how they were grieving over the poor drowned Ali. But he said, 'Where is my horse? Tell me, where is my horse?' Then they told him of the visit of the Chingana, and how they had sent food to Ali, whom she had seen suffering. The brother said, 'Tell me quick! Which way did she go?' and he scolded his sister for crying and being so foolish. They pointed out the direction taken by the gypsy woman, and the brother ran on at full speed. In about half an hour he came to a mill. He stopped here, thinking that the miller might give him information about the Chingana woman, who, he felt sure, meant to steal his horse. Now when the Chingana had reached the mill, fearing she might be overtaken, she had stopped and asked the miller to change clothes with her, and to conceal the horse in his stable. The miller was not a very wise man, and consented to do as the Chingana asked; so when Fatima's brother came to him, the miller was wearing the dress of the old woman as he worked at grinding the corn. The brother quickly spied the horse in a stall underneath the house, and as he talked with the miller, questioning him about the Chingana woman, he said, 'Why, you are wearing the dress my sister described. You must have on the clothes of the gypsy.' Just then, lifting his eyes, he saw in a tall tree above him a man looking down. This was the Chingana woman, for after putting on the clothes of the miller she had climbed the tree, hoping to conceal herself in the branches. The brother then told the miller he must confess the whole truth, for he felt sure that he knew all about the thief. After some urging, the miller told him how the Chingana woman had come to him, and asked him to change clothes and to conceal the horse. This he had done, meaning no harm. He then led out the horse, which the brother took possession of, but this did not satisfy him. He said the Chingana woman must go to prison. He bade the woman come down from the tree, but she refused to do this until officers came and commanded her to descend. She was then led away to prison. The brother mounted his horse and returned home. When he reached home the women were still crying. He said to Fatima, 'Are you not ashamed to sit here crying and talking of your lost son Ali? You have no son; you are a young girl. You should be ashamed to be so foolish, and to cry aloud about your son Ali.' His words had no effect upon Fatima, who continued to weep and cry aloud. At last the brother drove her out of the house, saying, 'You shall not longer live in my house, you foolish girl, who sit crying about your son Ali.' Fatima, weeping, went away to one of the neighbors, with whom she stayed two days. Then she came back, begging her brother's forgiveness, asking to be allowed to come back to her home, and promising that she would be quiet and gentle as before. She said, 'I am sorry that I was so foolish. I did not know what I was about. I hope you will forgive me.' This he did, and they lived in peace forever after.

He went there, and after spending some fourteen days there a wealthy merchant, who wondered why was spending so much time on the bridge, approached him and asked him what he was doing there. The latter answered, 'I dreamed that I was to go to the bridge at Regensburg, where I would become rich.' 'What?' said the merchant, 'You came here because of a dream? Dreams are fantasies and lies. Why I myself dreamed that there is a large pot of gold buried beneath that large tree over there.' And he pointed to the tree. 'But I paid no attention, for dreams are fantasies.'

{"label": "155", "text": "Once upon a time a Brahman, who was walking along the road, came upon an iron cage, in which a great tiger had been shut up by the villagers who caught him. As the Brahman passed by, the tiger called out and said to him, 'Brother Brahman, brother Brahman, have pity on me, and let me out of this cage for one minute only, to drink a little water, for I am dying of thirst.' The Brahman answered, 'No, I will not; for if I let you out of the cage you will eat me.' 'O father of mercy,' answered the tiger, 'in truth that will not. I will never be so ungrateful. Only let me out, that I may drink some water and return.' Then the Brahman took pity on him, and opened the cage door; but no sooner had he done so than the tiger, jumping out, said, 'Now, I will eat you first, and drink the water afterwards.' But the Brahman said, 'Only do not kill me hastily. Let us first ask the opinion of six, and if all of them say it is just and fair that you should put me to death, then I am willing to die.' 'Very well,' answered the tiger, 'it shall be as you say. We will first ask the opinion of six.' So the Brahman and the tiger walked on till they came to a banyan tree; and the Brahman said to it, 'Banyan tree, banyan tree, hear and give judgment.' 'On what must I give judgment ?' asked the banyan tree. 'This tiger,' said the Brahman,' begged me to let him out of his cage to drink a little water, and he promised not to hurt me if I did so. But now that I have let him out he wishes to eat me. Is it just that he should do so, or no?' The banyan tree answered, 'Men often come to take refuge in the cool shade under my boughs from the scorching rays of the sun; but when they have rested, they cut and break my pretty branches, and wantonly scatter the leaves that sheltered them. Let the tiger eat the man, for men are an ungrateful race.' At these words the tiger would have instantly killed the Brahman; but the Brahman said, 'Tiger, tiger, you must not kill me yet, for you promised that we should first hear the judgment of six.' 'Very well,' said the tiger, and they went on their way. After a little while they met a camel. 'Sir camel, sir camel,' cried the Brahman, 'hear and give judgment.' 'On what shall I give judgment?' asked the camel. And the Brahman related how the tiger had begged him to open the cage door, and promised not to eat him if he did so; and how he had afterwards determined to break his word, and asked if that were just or not. The camel replied, 'When I was young and strong, and could do much work, my master took care of me and gave me good food; but now that I am old, and have lost all my strength in his service, he overloads me, and starves me, and beats me without mercy. Let the tiger eat the man, for men are an unjust and cruel race.' The tiger would then have killed the Brahman, but the latter said, 'Stop, tiger, for we must first hear the judgment of six.' So they both went again on their way. At a little distance they found a bullock lying by the roadside. The Brahman said to him, 'Brother bullock, brother bullock, hear and give judgment.' 'On what must I give judgment?' asked the bullock. The Brahman answered, 'I found this tiger in a cage, and he prayed me to open the door and let him out to drink a little water, and promised not to kill me if I did so; but when I had let him out he resolved to put me to death. Is it fair he should do so or not?' The bullock said, 'When I was able to work, my master fed me well and tended me carefully, but now I am old he has forgotten all I did for him, and left me by the roadside to die. Let the tiger eat the man, for men have no pity.' Three out of the six had given judgment against the Brahman, but still he did not lose all hope, and determined to ask the other three. They next met an eagle flying through the air, to whom the Brahman cried, 'O eagle, great eagle, hear and give judgment.' 'On what must I give judgment?' asked the eagle. The Brahman stated the case, but the eagle answered, 'Whenever men see me they try to shoot me; they climb the rocks and steal away my little ones. Let the tiger eat the man, for men are the persecutors of the earth.' Then the tiger began to roar, and said, 'The judgment of all is against you, O Brahman!' But the Brahman answered, 'Stay yet a little longer, for two others must first be asked' After this they saw an alligator, and the Brahman related the matter to him, hoping for a more favorable verdict. But the alligator said, 'Whenever I put my nose out of the water, men torment me, and try to kill me. Let the tiger eat the man, for as long as men live we shall have no rest.' The Brahman gave himself up as lost; but once more he prayed the tiger to have patience, and to let him ask the opinion of the sixth judge. Now the sixth was a jackal. The Brahman again told his story, and said to him, 'Mama jackal, mama jackal, say what is your judgment?' The jackal answered, 'It is impossible for me to decide who is in the right and who in the wrong, unless I see the exact position in which you were when the dispute began. Show me the place.' So the Brahman and the tiger returned to the place where they first met, and the jackal went with them. When they got there, the jackal said, 'Now, Brahman, show me exactly where you stood.' 'Here,' said the Brahman, standing by the iron tiger cage. 'Exactly there, was it?' asked the jackal. 'Exactly here,' replied the Brahman. 'Where was the tiger then?' asked the jackal. 'In the cage,' answered the tiger. 'How do you mean?' said the jackal. 'How were you within the cage? Which way were you looking?' 'Why, I stood so,' said the tiger, jumping into the cage, 'and my head was on this side.' 'Very good,' said the jackal. 'But I cannot judge without understanding the whole matter exactly. Was the cage door open or shut?' 'Shut, and bolted,' said the Brahman. 'Then shut and bolt it,' said the jackal. When the Brahman had done this, the jackal said, 'Oh, you wicked and ungrateful tiger, when the good Brahman opened your cage door, is to eat him the only return you would make? Stay there, then, for the rest of your days, for no one will ever let you out again. Proceed on your journey, friend Brahman. Your road lies that way, and mine this.' So saying, the jackal ran off in one direction, and the Brahman went rejoicing on his way in the other.

He tried in vain to get out through the bars, and rolled and bit with rage and grief when he failed. By chance a poor Brahman came by. 'Let me out of this cage, oh pious one!' cried the tiger. 'Nay, my friend,' replied the Brahman mildly, 'you would probably eat me if I did.' 'Not at all!' swore the tiger with many oaths. 'On the contrary, I should be for ever grateful, and serve you as a slave!' Now when the tiger sobbed and sighed and wept and swore, the pious Brahman's heart softened, and at last he consented to open the door of the cage. Out popped the tiger, and, seizing the poor man, cried, 'What a fool you are! What is to prevent my eating you now, for after being cooped up so long I am just terribly hungry!' In vain the Brahman pleaded for his life. The most he could gain was a promise to abide by the decision of the first three things he chose to question as to the justice of the tiger's action. So the Brahman first asked a pipal tree what it thought of the matter, but the pipal tree replied coldly, 'What have you to complain about? Don't I give shade and shelter to everyone who passes by, and don't they in return tear down my branches to feed their cattle? Don't whimper. Be a man!' Then the Brahman, sad at heart, went further afield till he saw a buffalo turning a well wheel. But he fared no better from it, for it answered, 'You are a fool to expect gratitude! Look at me! Whilst I gave milk they fed me on cotton seed and oil cake, but now I am dry they yoke me here and give me refuse as fodder!' The Brahman, still more sad, asked the road to give him its opinion. 'My dear sir,' said the road, 'how foolish you are to expect anything else! Here am I, useful to everybody, yet all, rich and poor, great and small, trample on me as they go past, giving me nothing but the ashes of their pipes and the husks of their grain!' On this the Brahman turned back sorrowfully, and on the way he met a jackal, who called out, 'Why, what's the matter, Mr. Brahman? You look as miserable as a fish out of water!' The Brahman told him all that had occurred. 'How very confusing!' said the jackal, when the recital was ended. 'Would you mind telling me over again, for everything has got so mixed up?' The Brahman told it all over again, but the jackal shook his head in a distracted sort of way, and still could not understand. 'It's very odd,' said he, sadly, 'but it all seems to go in at one ear and out at the other! I will go to the place where it all happened, and then perhaps I shall be able to give a judgment.' So they returned to the cage, by which the tiger was waiting for the Brahman, and sharpening his teeth and claws. 'You've been away a long time!' growled the savage beast, 'but now let us begin our dinner.' 'Our dinner!' thought the wretched Brahman, as his knees knocked together with fright. 'What a remarkably delicate way of putting it!' 'Give me five minutes, my lord!' he pleaded, 'in order that I may explain matters to the jackal here, who is somewhat slow in his wits.' The tiger consented, and the Brahman began the whole story over again, not missing a single detail, and spinning as long a yarn as possible. 'Oh, my poor brain! Oh, my poor brain!' cried the jackal, wringing its paws. 'Let me see! How did it all begin? You were in the cage, and the tiger cam walking by --' 'Pooh!' interrupted the tiger, 'what a fool you are! I was in the cage.' 'Of course!' cried the jackal, pretending to tremble with fright. 'Yes! I was in the cage -- no I wasn't -- dear! dear! where are my wits? Let me see -- the tiger was in the Brahman, and the cage came walking by -- no, that's not it, either! Well, don't mind me, but begin your dinner, for I shall never understand!' 'Yes, you shall!' returned the tiger, in a rage at the jackal's stupidity. 'I'll make you understand! Look here -- I am the tiger --' 'Yes, my lord!' 'And that is the Brahman --' 'And that is the cage --' 'And I was in the cage. Do you understand?' 'Yes -- no -- please, my lord --' 'Well?' cried the tiger impatiently. 'Please, my lord! How did you get in?' 'How! Why in the usual way, of course!' 'Oh, dear me! -- My head is beginning to whirl again! Please don't be angry, my lord, but what is the usual way?' At this the tiger lost patience, and, jumping into the cage, cried, 'This way! Now do you understand how it was?' 'Perfectly!' grinned the jackal, as he dexterously shut the door, 'and if you will permit me to say so, I think matters will remain as they were!' Fairy Tales (London: David Nutt, 1892), no.

At the top they are closed partially only with wood which, in time of war, can easily be removed so that the connection can be destroyed without blasting. The following legend is told about this bridge: The builder had agreed to complete the bridge by a certain date. As the date approached he saw that it would be impossible to meet the deadline. With only two days remaining, in his fear he called upon the devil and asked him for help. The devil appeared to him and offered to complete the bridge during the last night if the builder would deliver to him the first living being that crossed the bridge. The contract was settled, and during the last night the devil completed the bridge. In the darkness no human eye saw how he did it. At the break of day the builder came and drove a rooster across the bridge ahead of himself, thus delivering it to the devil. However, the latter had expected a human soul, and when he saw that he had been deceived he angrily grabbed the rooster, ripped it apart, and threw it through the bridge, thus causing the two holes that to the present day cannot be mortared shut. Any repair work that is completed during the day just falls apart the next night. A golden rooster on an iron bar still stands as the bridge's emblem.", "title": "The Sachsenh\u00e4user Bridge at Frankfurt", "id": 562}
{"label": "480", "text": "Well, she went all about the town, but no one wanted a girl like her. So she went on farther into the country, and she came to a place where there was an oven where there was lots of bread baking. And the bread said, 'Little girl, little girl, take us out, take us out. We have been baking seven years, and no one has come to take us out.' So the girl took out the bread, laid it on the ground, and went on her way. Then she met a cow, and the cow said, 'Little girl, little girl, milk me, milk me! Seven years have I been waiting, and no one has come to milk me.' The girl milked the cow into the pails that stood by. As she was thirsty she drank some, and left the rest in the pails by the cow. Then she went on a little bit farther, and came to an apple-tree, so loaded with fruit that its branches were breaking down, and the tree said, 'Little girl, little girl, help me shake my fruit. My branches are breaking, it is so heavy.' And the girl said, 'Of course I will, you poor tree.' So she shook the fruit all off, propped up the branches, and left the fruit on the ground under the tree. Then she went on again till she came to a house. Now in this house there lived a witch, and this witch took girls into her house as servants. And when she heard that this girl had left her home to seek service, she said that she would try her, and give her good wages. The witch told the girl what work she was to do. 'You must keep the house clean and tidy, sweep the floor and the fireplace; but there is one thing you must never do. You must never look up the chimney, or something bad will befall you.' So the girl promised to do as she was told, but one morning as she was cleaning, and the witch was out, she forgot what the witch said, and looked up the chimney. When she did this a great bag of money fell down in her lap. This happened again and again. So the girl started to go off home. When she had gone some way she heard the witch coming after her. So she ran to the apple-tree and cried: When the witch had gone down another way, the girl went on again, and just as she got to the cow she heard the witch coming after her again, so she ran to the cow and cried: When the old witch came up, she looked about and said to the cow: When the witch had gone off another way, the little girl went on again, and when she was near the oven she heard the witch coming after her again, so she ran to the oven and cried: And the baker hid her behind the oven. When the witch came up she looked here and there and everywhere, and then said to the baker: The old witch went to look, and the oven said, 'Get in and look in the furthest corner.' The witch did so, and when she was inside the oven shut her door, and the witch was kept there for a very long time. The girl then went off again, and reached her home with her money bags, married a rich man, and lived happy ever afterwards. The other sister then thought she would go and do the same. And she went the same way. But when she reached the oven, and the bread said, 'Little girl, little girl, take us out. Seven years have we been baking, and no one has come to take us out.' The girl said, 'No, I don't want to burn my fingers.' So she went on till she met the cow, and the cow said, 'Little girl, little girl, milk me, milk me, do. Seven years have I been waiting, and no one has come to milk me.' But the girl said, 'No, I can't milk you, I'm in a hurry,' and went on faster. Then she came to the apple-tree, and the apple- tree asked her to help shake the fruit. But the girl said, 'No, I can't; another day p'raps I may,' and went on till she came to the witch's house. Well, it happened to her just the same as to the other girl -- she forgot what she was told, and one day when the witch was out, looked up the chimney, and down fell a bag of money. Well, she thought she would be off at once. When she reached the apple-tree, she heard the witch coming after her, and she cried: Presently the witch came up and said: So the old witch went after her and caught her, she took all the money away from her, beat her, and sent her off home just as she was. Parallels: I have a dim memory of hearing a similar tale in Australia in 1860. It is clearly parallel with the Grimms' ''Frau Holle,' where the good girl is rewarded and the bad punished in a similar way. Perrault's 'Toads and Diamonds' is of the same genus.", "title": "The Old Witch", "id": 563}
{"label": "670", "text": "A shepherd saved the life of the daughter of the king of snakes, the princess narrowly escaping being burnt to death. To show him her gratitude she taught him the language of animals, and he was able to understand them. One day his donkey said something that made him smile; whereupon his wife commenced to tease him, and wanted to know the joke, but the shepherd was unable to gratify her wish, as his betraying the secret would have immediately been followed by the penalty of sudden death. However the wife would not give in and leave him in peace, but continued to torment her husband with so many questions that he at last determined to die rather than to bear his wife's ill temper any longer. With this view he had his coffin made and brought to his house; he laid down in the coffin quite prepared for death and ready to divulge the secret. His faithful dog sat mournfully by his side watching, while the cock belonging to the house merrily hopped about in the room. The dog remonstrated with the cock and said that this was not the time for merriment, seeing how near their master was to death. But the cock replied quite curtly, 'It's master's own fault! Why is he such a great fool and coward? Look at me! I have fifty wives, and they all do as I tell them to do! If I can get on with so many, surely he ought to be able to manage one!' Hearing this the shepherd jumped out of the coffin, seized a wet rope end and gave the woman a sound thrashing.

{"label": "332", "text": "There was a very poor man who had to make arrangements for his child's baptism. But did not know where he was going, nor whom he might find to serve as godparents. At last he met a person who asked him where he was going. He was looking for godparents. 'Then you can just ask me,' said the stranger. Yes, that would do, but the man wanted to know who the stranger was. 'I'm the one they call the Devil,' he said. 'No, I do not want you, for you are evil. You only want to hurt people.' Then the two parted. He went on his way again, and someone else approached him. The stranger asked him where he was going. He was looking for godparents. 'Then you can just as well ask me as anyone else.' Of course he wanted to know who the stranger was. He was the one they call Our Lord. 'No, I do not want you, because you make people different. You make both the poor and the rich, and you do not care.' Then he went on his way again, thinking: 'I must be able to find someone who is suitable for me.' Then he met a third person, who asked him the same question, and then said: 'You can just as well ask me as anyone else.' He wanted to know who this stranger was. He always had this question. He was Death. 'You are the one I want, for you are an honest man, and no one passes you by. You take everyone with you, both poor and rich. Death was was pleased that he had been invited, and he wanted to wish him well. 'Yes, God help me,' said the Man, 'but I do not know what I want.' 'Well, for example, you could want to be a Doctor.' 'I do not know about medicine or anything like that.' 'Well, that doesn't matter. I will tell you just one thing. Now you know who I am, and when you are called to the sick and see me sitting at the head of the bed, you must not bother to treat them, for they shall die. However, if am sitted at their feet, they will revover, no matter what you give them.' So he pretended to be a doctor, and everyone came to him to be cured. He had been very poor before, but now he became wealthy. He was famous, and wherever he went there was no one like him. Once he was called on to treat a king from a foreign land who had lain ill for many years. When he came in to the sick man, Death was seated at the head of the bed. Now he did not want the king to die, for he had long since been overcome by the lust for money and fame. So he ordered that the sick king should be turned around, and the king did indeed recover, for Death was now seated at his feet. For this service he got everything he could want, and more. Then he returned home, and for a time lived in wealth at his own estate. Then Death came to him once more, saying that now he should die. He pleaded to be allowed to live a little longer. No, that was not possible, for he had deceived Death with the king. 'May I not be allowed to read the Lord's Prayer before I die?' Yes, for it would be a sin to deny him that. 'Then, in truth, it will be a long time before I read it.' Now he was on his feet again and could cure as usual. Everyone who came to him was cured. However, it was wrong that he could not read the Lord's Prayer. He longed terribly to do so. Then one day he met a little herder boy. He asked the boy if he could read something. 'Only a little,' replied the boy. That was not much of an answer. Could he read the Lord's Prayer? He was not sure. He had known it, but now he hardly knew if he could still do so. So the boy was supposed to read it, but he could not begin. Then the doctor took over and said: 'Our father....' The boy could not continue, so the doctor had to keep saying the prayer word for word until he came to the end. Then Death suddenly appeared to him again, and this time he had to give up his life.

{"label": "1137", "text": "The Estonians call a farm servant who is in charge of barns and grain a row-man. Such a row-man was once sitting and molding buttons when the devil came up to him, greeted him, and asked, 'What are you doing there?' 'I am molding eyes.' 'Eyes? Can you mold me some new ones?' 'Oh yes, but right now I do not have any at hand.' 'But would you do it for me another time?' 'I can do that,' said the row-man. 'When should I come back?' 'Whenever you want to.' The next day the devil returned to have eyes molded for himself. The row-man said, 'Do you want large ones or small ones?' 'Very large ones.' The man began to melt a large quantity of lead, saying, 'I cannot mold for you unless you let me tie you down.' He told him to lie down with his back on a bench, then took some thick, strong cords and tied him down securely. After the devil was tightly bound, he asked, 'What is your name?' 'My name is Issi (self).' 'That is a good name. I do not know of a better one.' The lead was now molten. The devil opened his eyes wide, thinking to get new ones, and waiting for the cast. 'I'm pouring now,' said the row-man, then poured the hot lead into the devil's eyes. The devil jumped up, with the bench on his back, and ran away. He ran past some people who were plowing in a field. They asked, 'Who did that to you?' The devil answered, 'Issi teggi (self did it).' The people laughed and said, 'Self done, self have.'

{"label": "1030", "text": "Once upon a time there was a clever, wily peasant, whose tricks could be much talked about. The best story, however, is how he once got the best of the devil and made a fool of him. One day the peasant had been working in his field, and just as it was getting dark he was getting ready to go home when in the middle of his field he saw a pile of burning coals. Filled with amazement he walked toward it, and sitting on the top of the glowing coals there was a little black devil. 'You must be sitting on a treasure,' said the peasant. 'Yes indeed,' replied the devil, 'on a treasure that contains more gold and silver than you have ever seen in your life.' 'The treasure is in my field and belongs to me,' said the peasant. 'It is yours,' answered the devil, 'if for two years you will give me one half of everything your field produces. I have enough money, but I have a desire for the fruits of the earth.' The peasant entered into the bargain, saying, 'To prevent any dispute from arising about the division, everything above the ground shall belong to you, and everything beneath the ground to me.' The devil was quite satisfied with that, but the cunning peasant had planted turnips. Now when harvest time came the devil appeared and wanted to take away his crop, but he found nothing except the yellow withered leaves, and the happy peasant dug up his turnips. 'You got the best of me this time,' said the devil, 'but it won't happen again. Next time what grows above ground shall be yours, and what is under it shall be mine.' 'That is all right with me,' answered the peasant. When planting time came the peasant did not plant turnips again, but wheat. The crop ripened, and the peasant went into the field and cut the full stalks off at ground level. When the devil came he found nothing but the stubble, and he angrily disappeared into a chasm in a cliff. 'That's the way one has to deal with foxes,' said the peasant, then carried away the treasure.", "title": "The Peasant and the Devil", "id": 567}

{"label": "20C", "text": "Once upon a time when Brahmadatta reigned in Benares, the Bodhisatta [the future Buddha] came to life as a young lion. And when fully grown he lived in a wood. At this time there was near the Western Ocean a grove of palms mixed with vilva trees. A certain hare lived here beneath a palm sapling, at the foot of a vilva tree. One day this hare, after feeding, came and lay down beneath the young palm tree. And the thought struck him, 'If this earth should be destroyed, what would become of me?' And at this very moment a ripe vilva fruit fell on a palm leaf. At the sound of it, the hare thought, 'This solid earth is collapsing,' and starting up he fled, without so much as looking behind him. Another hare saw him scampering off, as if frightened to death, and asked the cause of his panic flight. 'Pray, don't ask me,' he said. The other hare cried, 'Pray, sir, what is it?' and kept running after him. Then the hare stopped a moment and without looking back said, 'The earth here is breaking up.' And at this the second hare ran after the other. And so first one and then another hare caught sight of him running, and joined in the chase till one hundred thousand hares all took to flight together. They were seen by a deer, a boar, an elk, a buffalo, a wild ox, a rhinoceros, a tiger, a lion, and an elephant. And when they asked what it meant and were told that the earth was breaking up, they too took to flight. So by degrees this host of animals extended to the length of a full league. When the Bodhisatta saw this headlong flight of the animals, and heard the cause of it was that the earth was coming to an end, he thought, 'The earth is nowhere coming to an end. Surely it must be some sound which was misunderstood by them. And if I don't make a great effort, they will all perish. I will save their lives.' So with the speed of a lion he got before them to the foot of a mountain, and lion-like roared three times. They were terribly frightened at the lion, and stopping in their flight stood all huddled together. The lion went in amongst them and asked why there were running away. 'The earth is collapsing,' they answered. 'Who saw it collapsing?' he said. 'The elephants know all about it,' they replied. He asked the elephants. 'We don't know,' they said, 'the lions know.' But the lions said, 'We don't know, the tigers know.' The tigers said, 'The rhinoceroses know.' The rhinoceroses said, 'The wild oxen know.' The wild oxen, 'the buffaloes.' The buffaloes, 'the elks.' The elks, 'the boars.' The boars, 'the deer.' The deer said, 'We don't know; the hares know.' When the hares were questioned, they pointed to one particular hare and said, 'This one told us.' So the Bodhisatta asked, 'Is it true, sir, that the earth is breaking up?' 'Yes, sir, I saw it,' said the hare. 'Where,' he asked, 'were you living, when you saw it?' 'Near the ocean, sir, in a grove of palms mixed with vilva trees. For as I was lying beneath the shade of a palm sapling at the foot of a vilva tree, methought, 'If this earth should break up, where shall I go?' And at that very moment I heard the sound the breaking up of the earth, and I fled.' Thought the lion, 'A ripe vilva fruit evidently must have fallen on a palm leaf and made a 'thud,' and this hare jumped to the conclusion that the earth was coming to an end, and ran away. I will find out the exact truth about it.' So he reassured the herd of animals, and said, 'I will take the hare and go and find out exactly whether the earth is coming to an end or not, in the place pointed out by him. Until I return, do you stay here.' Then placing the hare on his back, he sprang forward with the speed of a lion, and putting the hare down in the palm grove, he said, 'Come, show us the place you meant.' 'I dare not, my lord,' said the hare. 'Come, don't be afraid,' said the lion. The hare, not venturing to go near the vilva tree, stood afar off and cried, 'Yonder, sir, is the place of dreadful sound,' and so saying, he repeated the first stanza: After hearing what the hare said, the lion went to the foot of the vilva tree, and saw the spot where the hare had been lying beneath the shade of the palm tree, and the ripe vilva fruit that fell on the palm leaf, and having carefully ascertained that the earth had not broken up, he placed the hare on his back and with the speed of a lion soon came again to the herd of beasts. Then he told them the whole story, and said, 'Don't be afraid.' And having thus reassured the herd of beasts, he let them go. Verily, if it had not been for the Bodhisatta at that time, all the beasts would have rushed into the sea and perished. It was all owing to the Bodhisatta that they escaped death.", "title": "The Timid Hare and the Flight of the Beasts (Jataka)", "id": 569}

Brer Rabbit, he says he can outrun Brer Terrapin, and Brer Terrapin, he just vows that he can outrun Brer Rabbit. Up and down they had it, until first thing you know, Brer Terrapin says he has a fifty-dollar bill in the chink of his chimney at home, and that bill done told him that he could beat Brer Rabbit in a fair race. Then Brer Rabbit says he has a fifty-dollar bill that says that he can leave Brer Terrapin so far behind that he could sow barley as he went along, and it would be ripe enough to cut by the time Brer Terrapin passed that way. Anyhow, they make the bet and put up the money, and old Brer Turkey Buzzard, he was summoned to be the judge and the stakeholder. And it wasn't long before all the arrangements were made. The race was a five-mile heat, and the ground was measured off, and at the end of every mile a post was stuck up. Brer Rabbit was to run down the big road, and Brer Terrapin, he says he'd gallop through the woods. Folks told him he could get along faster in the road, but old Brer Terrapin, he knows what he's doing. Miss Meadows and the gals and most all the neighbors got wind of the fun, and when the day was set, they were determined to be on hand. Brer Rabbit, he trains himself every day, and he skips over the ground just as gaily as a June cricket. Old Brer Terrapin, he lies low in the swamp. He had a wife and three children, old Brer Terrapin did, and they were all the very spitting image of the old man. Anybody who knew one from the other had to take a spyglass, and then they were liable to get fooled. That's the way matters stand until the day of the race, and on that day old Brer Terrapin and his old woman and his three children, they got up before sun-up and went to the place. The old woman, she took her stand near the first milepost, she did, and the children near the others, up to the last, and there old Brer Terrapin, he took his stand. By and by, here come the folks. Judge Buzzard, he comes, and Miss Meadows and the gals, they come, and then here comes Brer Rabbit with ribbons tied around his neck and streaming from his ears. The folks all went to the other end of the track to see how they would come out. When the time comes, Judge Buzzard struts around and pulls out his watch and hollers out, 'Gents, are you ready?' Brer Rabbit, he says 'yes,' and old Miss Terrapin hollers 'go' from the edge of the woods. Brer Rabbit, he lit out on the race, and old Miss Terrapin, she put out for home. Judge Buzzard arose and skimmed along to see that the race was run fair. When Brer Rabbit got to the first milepost, one of the terrapin children crawls out of the woods, he does, and makes for the place. Brer Rabbit, he hollers out, 'Where are you, Brer Terrapin?' 'Here I come a-bulging,' says the terrapin. Brer Rabbit is so glad he's ahead that he puts out harder than ever, and the Terrapin, he makes for home. When he comes to the next post, another terrapin crawls out of the woods. 'Where are you, Brer Terrapin?' says Brer Rabbit. 'Here I come a-boiling,' says the terrapin. Brer Rabbit, he lit out, he did, and comes to the next post, and there was the terrapin. Then he comes to the next, and there was the terrapin. Then he had one more mile to run, and he's wheezing and puffing. By and by old Brer Terrapin looks way off down the road, and he sees Judge Buzzard sailing along, and he knows it's time for him to be up. So he scrambles out of the wood and rolls across the ditch and shuffles through the crowd of folks and gets to the milepost and crawls behind it. By and by, first thing you know, here comes Brer Rabbit. He looks around and he don't see Brer Terrapin, and he squalls out, 'Give me the money, Brer Buzzard, give me the money!' Then Miss Meadows and the gals, they holler and laugh fit to kill themselves, and old Brer Terrapin, he rises up from behind the post and says, 'If you'll give me time to catch my breath, gents and ladies, one and all, I suspect I'll finger that money myself,' he says, and sure enough, Brer Terrapin ties the purse around his neck and scaddles off home.

{"label": "1161", "text": "On the estate of Norrhult, in the parish of Rumskulla, the people in olden times were very much troubled by trolls and ghosts. The disturbances finally became so unbearable that they were compelled to desert house and home, and seek an asylum with their neighbors. One old man was left behind, and he, because he was so feeble that he could not move with the rest. Some time thereafter, there came one evening a man having with him a bear, and asked for lodgings for himself and companion. The old man consented, but expressed doubts about his guest being able to endure the disturbances that were likely to occur during the night. The stranger replied that he was not afraid of noises, and laid himself down, with his bear, near the old man's bed. Only a few hours had passed, when a multitude of trolls came into the hut and began their usual clatter. Some of them built the fire in the fireplace, others set the kettle upon the fire, and others again put into the kettle a mess of filth, such as lizards, frogs, worms, etc. When the mess was cooked, the table was laid, and the trolls sat down to the repast. One of them threw a worm to the bear, and said, 'Will you have a fish, kitty?' Another went to the bear-keeper and asked him if he would not have some of their food. At this the latter let loose the bear, which struck about him so lustily that soon the whole swarm was flying through the door. Some time after, the door was again opened, and a troll with mouth so large that it filled the whole opening peeked in. 'Sic him!' said the bear-keeper, and the bear soon hunted him away also. In the morning the stranger gathered the people of the village around him and directed them to raise a cross upon the estate, and to engrave a prayer on Cross Mountain, where the trolls dwelt, and they would be freed from their troublesome visitors. Seven years later a resident of Norrhult went to Norrk\u00c3\u00b6ping. On his way home he met a man who asked him where he came from, and, upon being informed, claimed to be a neighbor, and invited the peasant to ride with him on his black horse Away they went at a lively trot along the road, the peasant supposed, but in fact high up in the air. When it became quite dark the horse stumbled so that the peasant came near falling off. 'It is well you were able to hold on,' said the horseman. 'That was the point of the steeple of Link\u00c3\u00b6ping's cathedral that the horse stumbled against. Listen!' continued he. 'Seven years ago I visited Norrhult. You then had a vicious cat there. Is it still alive?' 'Yes, truly, and many more,' said the peasant. After a time the rider checked his horse and bade the peasant dismount. When the latter looked around him he found himself at Cross Mountain, near his home. Some time later another troll came to the peasant's cottage and asked if that great savage cat still lived. 'Look out!' said the peasant. 'She is lying there by the oven, and has seven young ones, all worse than she.' 'Oh!' cried the troll, and rushed for the door. From that time no trolls have ever visited Norrhult.", "title": "The Cat of Norrhult", "id": 573}
{"label": "510A", "text": "Once upon a time there was a man who had three daughters. He was once ordered to go away to work, and said the them, 'Since I am about making a journey, what do you want me to bring you when I return?' One asked for a handsome dress; the other, a fine hat and a beautiful shawl. He said to the youngest, 'And you, Cinderella, what do you want?' They called her Cinderella because she always sat in the chimney corner. 'You must buy me a little bird Verdeli\u00c3\u00b2.' 'The simpleton! She does not know what to do with the bird! Instead of ordering a handsome dress, a fine shawl, she takes a bird. Who knows what she will do with it!' 'Silence!' she says. 'It pleases me.' The father went, and on his return brought the dress, hat, and shawl for the two sisters, and the little bird for Cinderella. The father was employed at the court, and one day the king said to him, 'I am going to give three balls; if you want to bring your daughters, do so; they will amuse themselves a little.' 'As you wish,' he replies, 'thanks!' and accepts. He went home and said, 'What do you think, girls? His majesty wishes you to attend his ball.' 'There, you see, Cinderella, if you had only asked for a handsome dress! This evening we are going to the ball.' She replied, 'It matters nothing to me! You go; I am not coming.' In the evening, when the time came, they adorned themselves, saying to Cinderella, 'Come along, there will be room for you, too.' 'I don't want to go; you go; I don't want to.' 'But,' said their father, 'let us go, let us go! Dress and come along; let her stay.' When they had gone, she went to the bird and said, 'O Bird Verdeli\u00c3\u00b2, make me more beautiful than I am!' She became clothed in a sea green dress, with so many diamonds that it blinded you to behold her. The bird made ready two purses of money, and said to her, 'Take these two purses, enter your carriage, and away!' She set out for the ball, and left the bird Verdeli\u00c3\u00b2 at home. She entered the ballroom. Scarcely had the gentlemen seen this beautiful lady (she dazzled them on all sides), when the king, just think of it, began to dance with her the whole evening. After he had danced with her all the evening, his majesty stopped, and she stood by her sisters. While she was at her sisters' side, she drew out her handkerchief, and a bracelet fell out. 'Oh, Signora,' said the eldest sister, 'you have dropped this.' 'Keep it for yourself,' she said. 'Oh, if Cinderella were only here, who knows what might not have happened to her?' The king had given orders that when this lady went away they should find out where she lived. After she had remained a little she left the ball. You can imagine whether the servants were on the lookout! She entered her carriage and away! She perceives that she is followed, takes the money and begins to throw it out of the window of the carriage. The greedy servants, I tell you, seeing all that money, thought no more of her, but stopped to pick up the money. She returned home and went upstairs. 'O Bird Verdeli\u00c3\u00b2, make me homelier than I am!' You ought to see how ugly, how horrid, she became, all ashes. When the sisters returned, they cried, 'Cin-der-ella!' 'Oh, leave her alone,' said her father. 'She is asleep now, leave her along!' But they went up and showed her the large and beautiful bracelet. 'Do you see, you simpleton? You might have had it.' 'It matters nothing to me.' Their father said, 'Let us go to supper, you little geese.' Let us return to the king, who was awaiting her servants, who had not the courage to appear, but kept away. He calls them. 'How did the matter go?' The fall at his feet. 'Thus and thus! She threw out so much money!' 'Wretches, you are nothing else.' he said. 'Were you afraid of not being rewarded? Well! tomorrow evening, attention, under pain of death.' The next evening the usual ball. The sisters say, 'Will you come this evening, Cinderella?' 'Oh,' she says, 'don't bother me! I don't want to go.' Their father cries out to them, 'How troublesome you are! Let her alone!' So they began to adorn themselves more handsomely than the former evening, and departed. 'Good-bye, Cinderella!' When they had gone, Cinderella went to the bird and said, 'Little Bird Verdeli\u00c3\u00b2, make me more beautiful than I am!' Then she became clothed in sea green, embroidered with all the fish of the sea, mingled with diamonds more than you could believe. The bird said, 'Take these two bags of sand, and when you are followed, throw it out, and so they will be blinded.' She entered her carriage and set out for the ball. As soon as his majesty saw her he began to dance with her and danced as long as he could. After he had danced as long as he could (she did not grow weary, but he did), she placed herself near her sisters, drew out her handkerchief, and there fell out a beautiful necklace all made of coal. The second sister said, 'Signora, you have dropped this.' She replied, 'Keep it for yourself.' 'If Cinderella were here, who knows what might not happen to her! Tomorrow she must come!' After a while she leaves the ball. The servants (just think, under pain of death!) were all on the alert, and followed her. She began to throw out all the sand, and they were blinded. She went home, dismounted, and went upstairs. 'Little Bird Verdeli\u00c3\u00b2, make me homelier than I am!' She became frightfully homely. When her sisters returned they began from below, 'Cin-der-ella! if you only knew what that lady gave us!' 'It matters nothing to me!' 'Yes, yes! you would have had it!' The father says, 'Let us go to supper and let her alone; you are really silly!' Let us return to his majesty, who was waiting for his servants to learn where she lived. Instead of that they were all brought back blinded, and had to be accompanied. 'Rogue!' he exclaimed, 'either this lady is some fairy or she must have some fairy who protects her.' The next day the sisters began, 'Cinderella, you must go this evening! Listen; it is the last evening; you must come.' The father: 'Oh let her alone! You are always teasing her!' Then they went away and began to prepare for the ball. When they were all prepared, they went to the ball with their father. When they had departed, Cinderella went to the bird: 'Little Bird Verdeli\u00c3\u00b2, make me more beautiful than I am!' Then she was dressed in all the colors of the heavens; all the comets, the stars, and moon on her dress, and the sun on her brow. She enters the ballroom. Who could look at her! For the sun alone they lower their eyes, and are all blinded. His majesty began to dance, but he could not look at her, because she dazzled him. He had already given orders to his servants to be on the lookout, under pain of death, not to go on foot, but to mount their horses that evening. After she had danced longer than on the previous evenings she placed herself by her father's side, drew out her handkerchief, and there fell out a snuffbox of gold, full of money. 'Signora, you have dropped this snuffbox.' 'Keep it for yourself!' Imagine that man. He opens it and sees it full of money. What a joy! After she had remained a time she went home as usual. The servants followed her on horseback, quickly, at a distance from the carriage; but on horseback that was not much trouble. She perceived that she had not prepared anything to throw that evening. 'Oh!' she cried. 'What shall I do?' She left the carriage quickly, and in her haste lost one of her slippers. The servants picked it up, took the number of the house, and went away. Cinderella went upstairs and said, 'Little Bird Verdeli\u00c3\u00b2, make me more homely than I am!' The bird does not answer. After she had repeated it three or four times, it answered, 'Rogue! I ought not to make you more homely, but ...' and she became homely and the bird continued, 'What are you going to do now? You are discovered.' She began to weep in earnest. When her sisters returned they cried, 'Cin-der-ella!' You can imagine that she did not answer them this evening. 'See what a beautiful snuffbox. If you had gone you might have had it.' 'I do not care! Go away!' Then their father called them to supper. Let us now turn to the servants who went back with the slipper and the number of the house. 'Tomorrow,' said his majesty, 'as soon as it is day, go to that house, take a carriage, and bring that lady to the palace.' The servants took the slipper and went away. The next morning they knocked at the door. Cinderella's father looked out and exclaimed, 'Oh heavens! It is his majesty's carriage. What does it mean?' They open the door and the servants ascend. 'What do you want of me?' asked the father. 'How many daughters have you?' 'Two.' 'Well, show them to us.' The father made them come in there. 'Sit down,' they said to one of them. They tried the slipper on her; it was ten times too large for her. The other one sat down; it was too small for her. 'But tell me, good man, have you no other daughters? Take care to tell the truth! because majesty wishes it, under pain of death!' 'Gentlemen, there is another one, but I do not mention it. She is all in the ashes, the coals. If you should see her! I do not call her my daughter from shame.' 'We have not come for beauty, or for finery; we want to see the girl!' Her sisters began to call her, 'Cin-der-ella!' but she did not answer. After a time she said, 'What is the matter?' 'You must come down! There are some gentlemen who wish to see you.' 'I don't want to come.' 'But you must come, you see!' 'Very well; tell them I will come in a moment.' She went to the little bird: 'Ah little Bird Verdeli\u00c3\u00b2, make me more beautiful than I am!' Then she was dressed as she had been the last evening, with the sun, and moon, and stars, and in addition, great chains all of gold everywhere about her. The bird said, 'Take me away with you! Put me in your bosom!' She puts the bird in her bosom and begins to descend the stairs. 'Do you hear her?' said the father. 'Do you hear her? She is dragging with her the chains from the chimney corner. You can imagine how frightful she will look!' When she reached the last step, and they saw her, 'Ah!' they exclaimed, and recognized the lady of the ball. You can imagine how her father and sisters were vexed. They made her sit down, and tried on the slipper, and it fitted her. Then they made her enter the carriage, and took her to his majesty, who recognized the lady of the other evenings. And you can imagine that, all in love as her was, he said to her, 'Will you really be my wife?' You may believe she consents. She sends for her father and sisters, and makes them all come to the palace. They celebrate the marriage. Imagine what fine festivals were given at this wedding! The servants who had discovered where Cinderella lived were promoted to the highest positions in the palace as a reward.", "title": "Cinderella (Italy)", "id": 574}
{"label": "1641", "text": "There was once a poor fagot-cutter that used to work very hard, and one day that he took a load of fagots to the doctor in the next town, he was brought into the parlour to be paid, and didn't he admire the fine furniture he saw about him! When he was coming away, says he to the doctor, 'Musha, sir, would you lend me one of these fine-bound books for about a quarter of a year or so, and I'll return it honestly?' 'What is the book to be about?' says the doctor, 'and what do you want with it?' 'I don't care what it's about,' says he, 'and I'll tell you when I return it the use I'll make of it.' The doctor laughed, and gave him a well-looking wolume, but I don't know no more nor the fagot-cutter himself what was in it. 'A fine thing,' says he, 'to be slavin' oneself as I do for my bit and sup, and see what grandeur that man is in for doing nothing at all, as a body might say.' When he got home, he removed bag and baggage into the town after selling his little furniture, and buying a shute of broad cloth, and a Caroline hat, and a Barcelona hankecher. He got a painter to put up a sign-board with DOCTOR CURE-ALL over his door, put some bottles on a shelf, and sat down at his little round table with his book before him. Well, he soon got custom, but all the cures he knew was bowl almanac [Bole-Armeniac], salts and senna, castor oil, and sugar and soap for plasters. But he was so courageous in promising cures, and so many got well, no thanks to him, and there was so many that there was nothing amiss with at all, that he soon got a great name. He even recovered stolen things, for he gave out that he knew by his books who had them, and the thieves used to bring them unknownst to him, and give him some money for not telling on them. Well, there was a gentleman in the neighbourhood that had a very valuable ring taken from him, and he sent for Dr. Cure-all to find out the thief for him. 'I'll find him out,' says he, 'if he's above ground, but it can't be done in a minute. I'll have to see where you kept it, and get a lock of hair from everyone in the house, and study my conjurin' book for eight days. The ninth morning you'll have the ring safe and sound. I'll have to stay on the premises the whole time.' 'Very good,' says the gentleman. Well, he lived like a fighting cock for five days, but I give you my word he began then to get uneasy, for no one about the house seemed inclined to confess, though he gave out from the beginning that he'd have his hand on the thief the evening of the eighth day. The evening of the sixth he was walking in the paddock near the hedge, and he was muttering to himself, 'Three days only now, and be this and be that there goes one of 'em!' says he in an angry voice. Well, there was three rogues of servants concerned in the robbery, and one of them was padrowlin' [patrolling] in the cabbage-garden the other side of the hedge the same minute. He never drew rein till he got to the other fellows, and says he, 'We're discovered as sure as fate.' Well, they talked and they talked, and didn't know what to do till next evening, when the second of 'em was close by the hedge, and what did he hear but the doctor cry out, 'And there goes the second of 'em!' Well, they were more frightened now than before, and came to the point of confessing if the doctor knew there was three of 'em. The next evening the poor man was walking sorrowful enough in the same place. 'Ovoch!' was he saying to himself, 'there was only three evenings of the time left since I took my walk here to give the thief an opportunity of talking to me,' and then his heart was so bitter he cried out, 'Here is the third of 'em!' 'Docthor, docthor,' says a voice the other side of the hedge, 'you're a considherate man; here's the ring and a guinea-note along with it. Keep our secret.' 'You don't deserve it, you unlucky rogue, for delaying so long. The master 'ud have you in the stone-jug [gaol] tomorrow only for your late repentance.' Well, the whole family were assembled in the big parlour next morning, and the doctor sitting very stately in an arm-chair. 'Who is the robber?' says the master. 'I know the robber, and the place he hid the ring,' says the doctor, 'but I can only reveal one. Which is it to be?' The master, of course, chose to get his valuable ring. 'Well, then,' says he, 'go to the hen-house wherever that is; I don't know. Put your right hand on the little board that's inside over the door, and in the middle of it you'll find what you're in search of.' Out went the mistress and the little girl that minded the fowl, and there the ring was sure enough. Well, there was great joy, you may depend, and very great honour was paid to the wise man, but the master's brother that came that day on a visit, wouldn't give the doctor any credit at all. 'Wait till dinner time,' says he 'and if I don't astonish his weak mind, you may say what you like.' Well, the brother and his servant were cooking something very secretly in the kitchen before dinner time, and when that was over, and the doctor's health was drunk, and himself greatly praised, says the brother, 'Doctor, I'll praise you more than all the family if you tell me what's in this covered plate.' Ah, wouldn't anyone pity the poor man at that moment? 'No use,' says he to himself, 'in throwing sand in people's eyes any longer.' Then speaking out loud, says be, 'Ah, sir, let the fox go as far as he pleases, he'll be cotch [caught] at last.' 'Well,' says the gentleman, 'I see I must give it up. It's a bit of a fox sure enough!' He lifted the cover for an instant, and then threw plate and cover and fox out of the window. And that's the way with the world.

{"label": "737", "text": "A key and Bible were procured, the key being so much longer than the Bible that, when placed between the leaves, the head and handle would project. If the enquiry was about the good faith of a sweetheart, the key was placed in Ruth i. 16, on the words, 'Entreat me not to leave thee: where thou goest I will go,' etc. The Bible was then closed, and tied round with tape. Two neutral persons, sitting opposite each other, held out the forefingers of their right hands, and the person who was consulting the oracle suspended the Bible between their two hands, resting the projecting parts of the key on the outstretched forefingers. No one spoke except the enquirer, and she, as she placed the key and Bible in position, repeated slowly the whole passage, 'Entreat me not to leave thee,' John or James, or whatever the name of the youth was, 'for where thou goest I will go,' etc. If the key and Bible turned and fell off the fingers, the answer was favourable; and generally by the time the whole passage was repeated this was the result, provided the parties holding up the key and Bible were firm and steady. For the detection of a thief, the formula was the same, with only this difference, that the key was put into the Bible at the fiftieth Psalm, and the enquirer named the suspected thief, and then repeated the eighteenth verse of that Psalm, 'When thou sawest a thief then thou consentest with him,' etc. If the Bible turned round and fell, it was held to be proof that the person named was the thief. This method of divining was not frequently practised, not through want of faith in its efficacy, but through superstitious terror, for the movement of the key was regarded as evidence that some unseen dread power was present, and so overpowering occasionally was the impression produced that the young woman who was chief actor in the scene fainted. The parties holding the key and Bible were generally old women, whose faith in the ordeal was perfect, and who, removed by their age from the intenser sympathies of youth, could therefore hold their hands with steadier nerve. It is only when firm hands hold it that the turning takes place, for this phenomenon depends upon the regular and steady pulsations in the fingers, and when held steadily the ordeal never fails.", "title": "The Bible and Key Trial", "id": 576}
{"label": "955", "text": "Once on a time there was a man who had a daughter, and she was so pretty her name was spread over many kingdoms, and lovers came to her as thick as autumn leaves. One of these made out that he was richer than all the rest; and grand and handsome he was too; so he was to have her, and after that he came over and over again to see her. As time went on, he said he should like her to come to his house and see how he lived; he was sorry he could not fetch her and go with her, but the day she came he would strew peas all along the path right up to his house door; but somehow or other it fell out that he strewed the peas a day too early. She set out and walked a long way, through wood and waste, and at last she came to a big grand house, which stood in a green field in the midst of the wood; but her lover was not at home, nor was there a soul in the house either. First, she went into the kitchen, and there she saw nothing but a strange bird which hung in a cage from the roof. Next she went into the parlour, and there everything was so fine it was beyond belief. But as she went into it, the bird called after her: 'Pretty maiden, be bold, but not too bold.' When she passed on into an inner room, the bird called out the same words. There she saw ever so many chests of drawers, and when she pulled open the drawers, they were filled with gold and silver, and everything that was rich and rare. When she went on into a second room the bird called out again: 'Pretty maiden! be bold, but not too bold.' In that room the walls were all hung round with women's dresses, till the room was crammed full. She went on into a third room, and then the bird screamed out: 'Pretty maiden! Pretty maiden, be bold, but not too bold.' And what do you think she saw there? Why! ever so many pails full of blood. So she passed on to a fourth room, and then the bird screamed and screeched after her: That room was full of heaps of dead bodies, and skeletons of slain women, and the girl got so afraid that she was going to run away out of the house, but she had only got as far as the next room, where the pails of blood stood, when the bird called out to her: 'Pretty maiden! Pretty maiden! Jump under the bed, jump under the bed, for now he's coming.' She was not slow to give heed to the bird, and to hide under the bed. She crept as far back close to the wall as she could, for she was so afraid she would have crept into the wall itself, had she been able! So in came her lover with another girl; and she begged so prettily and so hard he would only spare her life, and then she would never say a word against him, but it was all no good. He tore off all her clothes and jewels, down to a ring which she had on her finger. That he pulled and tore at, but when he couldn't get it off he hacked off her finger, and it rolled away under the bed to the girl who lay there, and she took it up and kept it, Her sweetheart told a little boy who was with him to creep under the bed and bring out the finger. Yes! he bent down and crept under, and saw the girl lying there; but she squeezed his hand hard, and then he saw what she meant. 'It lies so far under, I can't reach it,' he cried. 'Let it bide there till tomorrow, and then I'll fetch it out.' Early next morning the robber went out, and the boy was left behind to mind the house, and he then went to meet the girl to whom his master was betrothed, and who had come, as you know, by mistake the day before. But before he went, the robber told him to be sure not to let her go into the two farthermost bedrooms. So when he was well off in the wood, the boy went and said she might come out now. 'You were lucky, that you were,' he said, 'in coming so soon, else he would have killed you like all the others.' She did not stay there long, you may fancy, but hurried back home as quick as ever she could, and when her father asked her why she had come so soon, she told him what sort of a man her sweetheart was, and all that she had heard and seen. A short time after her lover came passing by that way, and he looked so grand that his raiment shone again, and he came to ask, he said, why she had never paid him that visit as she had promised. 'Oh!' said her father; 'there came a man in the way with a sledge and scattered the peas, and she couldn't find her way; but now you must just put up with our poor house, and stay the night, for you must know we have guests coming, and it will be just a betrothal feast.' So when they had all eaten and drunk, and still sat round the table, the daughter of the house said she had dreamt such a strange dream a few nights before. If they cared to hear it she would tell it them, but they must all promise to sit quite still till she came to the end. Yes! They were all ready to hear, and they all promised to sit still, and her sweetheart as well. 'I dreamt I was walking along a broad path, and it was strewn with peas.' 'Yes! Yes!' said her sweetheart; 'just as it will be when you go to my house, my love.' 'Then the path got narrower and narrower, and it went far far away through wood and waste.' 'Just like the way to my house, my love,' said her sweetheart. 'And so I came to a green field, in which stood a big grand house.' 'Just like my house, my love,' said her sweetheart. 'So I went into the kitchen, but I saw no living soul, and from the roof hung a strange bird in a cage, and as I passed on into the parlour, it called after me, 'Pretty maiden, be bold, but not too bold.'' 'Just like my house that too, my love!' said her sweetheart. 'So I passed on into a bedroom, arid the bird bawled after me the same words, and in there were so many chests of drawers, and when I pulled the drawers out and looked into them, they were filled with gold and silver stuffs, and everything that was grand.' 'That is just like it is at my house, my love,' said her sweetheart. 'I, too, have many drawers full of gold and silver, and costly things.' 'So I went on into another bedroom, and the bird screeched out to me the very same words; and that room was all hung round on the walls with fine dresses of women.' 'Yes, that too, is just as it is in my house,' he said; 'there are dresses and finery there both of silk and satin.' 'Well! when I passed on to the next bedroom, the bird began to screech and scream: 'Pretty maiden, pretty maiden! be bold, but not too bold!' and in this room were casks and pails all round the walls, and they were full of blood.' 'Fie,' said her sweetheart, 'how nasty. It isn't at all like that in my house, my love,' for now he began to grow uneasy and wished to be off. 'Why!' said the daughter, 'it's only a dream, you know, that I am telling. Sit still. The least you can do is to hear my dream out.' Then she went on: 'When I went on into the next bedroom the bird began to scream out as loudly as before, the same words: 'Pretty maiden, pretty maiden! be bold, but not too bold.' And there lay many dead bodies and skeletons of slain folk.' 'No! no,' said her sweetheart, 'there's nothing like that in my house,' and again he tried to run out. 'Sit still, I say,' she said, 'it is nothing else than a dream, and you may very well hear it out. I, too, thought it dreadful, and ran back again, but I had not got farther than the next room where all those pails of blood stood, when the bird screeched out that I must jump under the bed and hide, for now he was coming; and so he came, and with him he had a girl who was so lovely I thought I had never seen her like before. She prayed and begged so prettily that he would spare her life. But he did not care a pin for all her tears and prayers; he tore off her clothes, and took all she had, and he neither spared her life nor aught else; but on her left hand she had a ring, which he could not tear off, so he hacked off her finger, and it rolled away under the bed to me.' 'Indeed! my love,' said her sweetheart, 'there's nothing like that in my house.' 'Yes, it was in your house,' she said, 'and here is the finger and the ring, and you are the man who hacked it off.' So they laid hands on him, and put him to death, and burnt both his body and his house in the wood.", "title": "The Sweetheart in the Wood", "id": 577}

{"label": "441", "text": "One day the merchant went out to hunt, and he traveled and journeyed till, oh! my lord's son, he found himself in such a thick forest that he saw neither the sky nor the earth; he just groped around like a blind man. Here, 'pon my soul! whether the merchant tried to free himself by turning to the left or the right, he only went into a thicker place. When he was there five days, in hunger and thirst, stumbling about in the great wild wood without liberation, the merchant called out, 'Oh, my God, if anyone would take me out of this great wild thicket to the right road, I would give him the best of my three daughters, and as a wedding gift three sacks of coin.' 'I'll lead thee out right away,' said someone before him. The merchant looked to the right, to the left, but not a soul did he see. 'Don't look around,' said the certain one again. 'Look under thy feet.' The merchant then looked in front and saw that near his feet was a little hedgehog, and to him he directed then his word and speech. 'Well, if thou wilt lead me out, I will give thee my best daughter and three sacks of coin; the first will be gold, the second silver, and the third copper.' The hedgehog went on ahead, the merchant walked after. Soon they came out of the great wild wood. Then the hedgehog went back, and the merchant turned his wagon-tongue homeward. Now the king went to hunt, went in the same way as the merchant; and he too was lost in the great wild wood. The king went to the right and the left, tried in every way to free himself; all he gained was that he came to a thicker and a darker place. He too stumbled around five days in the thick wood, without food or drink. On the sixth morning the king cried out, 'Oh, my God! If any one would free me from this dense wood, even if a worm, I would give him the most beautiful of my daughters, and as a wedding gift three coaches full of coin.' 'I'll lead thee out right away,' said someone near him. The king looked to the right, to the left, but saw not a soul. 'Why stare around? Look at thy feet; here I am.' The king then looked at his feet and saw a little hedgehog stretched out, and said to him, ' Well, hedgehog, if thou wilt lead me forth, I'll give thee the fairest of my daughters and three coaches full of coin: the first gold, the second silver, the third copper.' The hedgehog went ahead, the king followed, and in this way they soon came out of the great wild wood. The hedgehog went back to his own place; the king reached home in safety. Very well, a poor man went out for dry branches. He went like the merchant and king, and he got astray, so that he wandered dry and hungry for five days in the great wild wood; and whether he turned to the right or the left he gained only this, that he went deeper into the denseness. 'My God,' cried the poor man at last, 'send me a liberator! If he would lead me out of this place, as I have neither gold nor silver, I would take him as a son, and care for him as my own child.' 'Well, my lord father, I'll lead thee out; only follow.' 'Where art thou, dear son?' 'Here, under thy feet; only look this way, my lord father.' The poor man looked near his feet, and saw a little hedgehog stretched out. 'Well, my dear son, lead me out and I'll keep my promise.' The hedgehog went ahead, the poor man followed, and soon they came out of the great wild wood. The hedgehog then went back to his own place, and the poor man strolled home. Well, things remained thus till once after bedtime there was a knocking at the poor man's door. 'My lord father, rise up, open the door.' The poor man, who was lying on the stove, heard only that some one was knocking at the door. 'My lord father, rise up, open the door.' The poor man heard, and heard that some one was knocking and as he thought calling out, 'My lord father, rise up, open the door.' But in his world life he had never had a son. The third time he heard clearly, 'My lord father, rise up, open the door.' The poor man did not take this as a joke. He rose up and opened the door. My lord's son, who came in to him? No one else than the little hedgehog. 'God give a good evening to my lord father and to my mother as well,' said the hedgehog. 'God receive thee, my dear son. Hast thou come then?' 'I have indeed, as thou seest, my lord father; but I am very tired, therefore wake up my mother and let her make a bed for me in my chamber.' What was the poor man to do? He woke up his wife; she made a towering bed, and the hedgehog lay in it. In the morning the poor man and his wife sat down to breakfast. They did not wish to forget their adopted son, but gave him food on a wooden plate under a bench by the fire. The hedgehog did not touch it. 'Well, my son,' asked the poor man, 'why not eat?' 'I do not eat, my lord father, because it is not proper to treat an adopted son like some orphan or another; therefore it beseems me not to eat all alone from a wooden plate under a bench at the fire. Seat me nicely at the table by thy side, put a tin plate before me, and place my food on it.' What was the poor man to do? He seated the hedgehog at his side, put a tin plate before him, and measured out food on it; then the hedgehog ate with his father and mother. When they had finished breakfast the hedgehog spoke thuswise, 'Well, my lord father, hast thou a couple of thalers?' 'I have.' 'I suppose thou art keeping them to buy salt and wood with?' 'Yes, my son.' 'I speak not of that, I am speaking of this: lend me the money; I will return it a thousand-fold. Set not thy mind much on salt and wood now; but go, my lord father, to the market. In such and such a place an old woman has a black cock for sale; buy him of her. If she asks a small price, give her double; for that will be my steed. When thou hast bought the cock for two prices, in such and such a place is a saddler; go to him. In a corner of his shop is a castaway, thrown-away, ragged, torn saddle; buy that for me, but give him two prices also. If he asks little, give him double.' The poor man put on his coat, put the two thalers in his pocket, went to the market, bought the black cock and the cast-away, thrown-away saddle for two prices; each one for two small bits of money. The hedgehog then saddled the black cock with the cast-away, thrown-away saddle, sat upon him, and went to the court of the rich merchant whom he had led out of the great wild wood. He knocked at the door and called, 'Hei, father-in-law, open the gate, let me in!' The rich merchant opened the gate in great wonder. Who was coming? No one other than our hedgehog, riding on a black cock. 'Hear me, rich merchant,' began the hedgehog; 'knowest thou thy promise? When I led thee out of the great wild wood, dost remember thy promise to give me the best of thy three daughters and three sacks of coin? Now I have come for the maid and the money.' What could the rich merchant do? He called his three daughters into the white chamber, and turned to the hedgehog, saying, 'Well, choose among the three the one who pleases thy eye, thy mouth, and thy heart.' The hedgehog chose the second daughter, for she was the most beautiful of the three. The merchant then measured out three sacks of coin. In the first, as he had said, there was gold, in the second silver, in the third copper; then he put his daughter and the three sacks of coin in a coach, to which four horses were attached, and he sent on her way his most beautiful daughter, with the hedgehog. They traveled and journeyed till the hedgehog, who was riding at the side of the coach on his black cock, came up, looked in through the window, and saw that the bride was in tears. 'Why dost thou cry, why dost thou weep, my heart's beautiful love?' asked the hedgehog of the maiden. 'Why should I not cry, why should I not weep, when God has punished me with such a nasty thing as thee? For I know not whether thou art a man or a beast.' 'If this is thy only trouble, my heart's beautiful love, we can easily cure it; I'll keep the three sacks of coin for myself, and thee I'll send back to thy father, for I see that of me thou art not worthy.' Thus was it settled; the hedgehog kept the three sacks of coin, but the merchant's daughter he sent back to her father. The hedgehog then took the coin to the poor man, who became so rich that I think another could not be found like him in seven villages. Now the hedgehog plucked up courage, saddled his black cock, sat on him, and rode away to the king, stood before him, and spoke in this fashion, 'Dost thou remember, king, that when I brought thee out of the great wild wood, thou didst promise that if I would show the right road thou wouldst give me the most beautiful of thy three daughters and fill for me three coaches, the first with gold, the second with silver, and the third with copper coin? I am here so that thou mayest keep thy word.' The king called his three daughters to the white chamber and said, 'I made a promise, and this is it: to give one of my three daughters to this hedgehog as wife. I promised because the hedgehog led me out of a great wild wood, in which I wandered for five days without food or drink, and he saved me from certain death. Therefore say, my dear daughters, which of you will agree to marry the hedgehog.' The eldest daughter turned away, the second turned away also; but the youngest and fairest spoke thus, 'If thou, my father the king, hast made such a promise, I will marry him. Let the will of God be done if he has appointed such a husband for me.' 'Thou art my dearest and best daughter,' said the king; and he kissed her again and again. Then the king measured out three coaches of coin, seated the princess in a chariot of gold and glass and started her on her journey, amid bitter tear-shedding, with the hedgehog, who rode at the side of the chariot on his black cock. They traveled and journeyed across forty-nine kingdoms till the hedgehog rode up to the chariot, opened the window, looked in, and saw that the princess was not weeping, but was in the best cheerful humor. 'Oh, my heart's beautiful love,' said the princess, 'why art thou riding on that black cock? Better come here and sit at my side on the velvet cushion.' 'Thou art not afraid of me?' 'I am not afraid.' 'Thou art not disgusted with me? ' 'No; if God has given thee to me, then thou shouldst be mine.' 'Thou art my only and most beloved wife!' said the hedgehog; and with that he shook himself, and straightway turned into such a pearl-given, charming, twenty-four-years-old king's son that tongue could not tell: golden-haired, golden-mouthed, golden-toothed. And the black cock shook himself three times, and became such a golden-haired magic steed that his equal would have to be sought for; the castaway, thrown-away saddle became golden; everything on it was gold to the last buckle. The king's son then picked out the most beautiful place in the kingdom; standing in the middle of this he thought once, and suddenly that instant there stood before him a copper-roofed marble palace, turning on a cock's foot, and in it every kind of the most varied and beautiful golden furniture. Everything and everything was of gold, beginning with the mirror frame and ending with the cooking spoon. The king's son conducted the beautiful golden bird -- the fair princess -- into the pearl-given palace, where, like birds in a nest, they lived in quiet harmony. When the merchant's three daughters and the two elder princesses heard of the happiness of the youngest princess, -- how well she had married, -- in their sorrow one of them jumped into a well, another drowned herself in a hemp-pond, and a third was drawn dead out of the river Tisza (Theiss). In this way four of the maidens came to an evil end; but the second daughter of the merchant gritted her teeth venomously at the princess, and made a firm and merciless resolve that she would embitter her life's happiness. She went therefore to the palace, and found service in the guise of an old woman. She, the devil-given, came at a critical time; for the Burkus [Prussian] king had declared war against the king's son, and the princess, while her husband was in the field, was left to the care of the merchant's daughter, disguised as an old woman. Milk might as well be confided to a cat as the princess to that cockroach of the underground kingdom. While the king's son was gone, the Lord gave the princess two beautiful children. The old woman packed them into a basket, put them under a tree in the woods, then ran back to the princess, who, recovering from a faint into which she had fallen, asked the old woman to give her the children so that she might embrace and kiss them. 'High queen,' answered the old woman, 'what is the use in delay or denial? They were two untimely, hairy monsters, and to save thee from terror at sight of them, I threw both into the river.' The two children slept quietly under the tree till a white deer burst with great noise through the thicket, went straight as if sent, and taking the basket hung it on his antlers; then the white deer disappeared in the forest, went on till he came to the bank of a stream, where he called three times. The Forest Maiden appeared as if by magic, took the basket with great delight, and ran panting into her own palace. The two children were seven years with the Forest Maiden, who reared them as carefully as if they had been her own. Here, 'pon my soul, what came of the affair, or what did not, the Forest Maiden once sent the little girl with a green jug for water, and enjoined on her rigorously to be careful not to break the jug. The little girl did not let this be said twice; she was obedient and attentive. She took the jug, and was at the well in a moment. When she came, she saw a little golden bird flying around the well. Being a child, she wanted to catch the golden bird, therefore ran around with the jug in her hand till at last she saw that only the handle was left. The little girl, terrified, burst into tears, sat at the edge of the well, and cried there. The Forest Maiden waited and waited; but she could not wait longer, therefore she sent the little brother with a second jug, and told him sternly to be careful not to break the jug. The little brother went in the same way, for he also, like children of that age, barely saw the golden bird when he wanted to strike it with the jug, which he whirled around till only the handle remained in his hand; then he burst into tears, sat by his sister, and there the two were crying at the edge of the well. Here, 'pon my soul, the golden bird pitied the children, and asked, 'Why do ye cry? Why do ye weep, pretty children?' 'Oh, pretty bird,' answered the boy, who had more sense than his sister, 'why should we not cry? Why should we not weep? We shall be flogged for breaking the green jugs; our dear mother will whip us.' 'Oh, my children, she is not your own mother! She is only your foster mother. Your father and mother live far from here, beyond those green mountains; so if ye will follow, I'll lead you home.' The two children wanted nothing else. They went back no more to their foster mother, for they would be flogged; but they followed the golden bird, which went always before them. And they traveled and journeyed till once in a forest they came upon a great heap of gold; near the gold was a number of dice, as if some one had been playing there. The little boy and girl each took a handful of gold, and went farther. They traveled and journeyed till they came to an inn; since they were wearied, and it was evening, they went in to ask lodging. In the inn three lords were playing dice; the two children at first merely noticed that they were playing. At last the boy took from his pocket the handful of gold, and began to play in such fashion that he won all the money of the three lords; and then one of them spoke thuswise, 'Well, my dear son, I see that thou hast good luck. I have in a certain place a charming flower garden; in the middle of the garden is a marble palace, and the palace has this peculiarity: if it is struck on the side three times with this golden rod, it will turn into a golden apple; and thou mayest put down the marble palace and the flower garden in any part of the world if thou wilt strike the golden apple with the small end of the golden rod. I will bet now this flower garden and this marble palace. If thou canst win, they'll be thine.' The little boy agreed; and he won fortunately the flower garden and the marble palace. The other then gave him the golden rod, and showed him where the garden and the palace were. Next morning the children sought out the garden and the palace, which the boy struck three times on the side, and it turned to a golden apple; he put the apple in his pocket, and strolled on homeward. The little golden bird flew always ahead of them. They traveled and journeyed till one time the golden bird stopped and said, 'Well, dear children, now we are at home; put down the golden apple on this spot and strike it three times with the rod, and ye will see what a beautiful marble palace and flowery garden there will be, speaking to the seven kingdoms. The report of the palace and garden will circulate immediately, and the king himself will come to look at them. Him ye must honor as your father, for thou my little boy art the king's son, and thou my little girl the king's daughter. Dear children, here in a golden frame is a picture which gives your arms and name. Hang in the palace this picture, in the best place; but lest it be seen, cover it with velvet, and show it to no man save your own father. When he asks what that picture is, draw the velvet from it, and the rest will follow.' So it happened; the two children hung up the picture in the best room of the marble palace, and covered it with velvet. Now, the report ran to distant parts of the kingdom that there was a charming and wonderful marble palace in such and such a place, and people hastened from the seventh province distant to look at it; so that the report came to the ears of the king himself. The king decided straightway to look at the flowery garden and marble palace; but he had hardly conceived the idea when the old woman gave him a drug. The king fell ill, and could not see the flowery garden and marble palace; and then the old woman, without invitation, stood before the king and said, 'High king, if thou art so curious to see this flowery garden and marble palace, then I will go and see if they are as beautiful as report says, and tell the story to thy Highness.' The king in one way or another agreed, and the old woman went, not to see the garden, but to bring the two children to evil destruction; the wicked creature tried but succeeded not, for her weapons broke. Not to confound one word with another, I will tell the whole tale in order and accuracy. The old witch had barely reached the famous flower garden when the two children hurried before her and showed everything from root to top, and the old piece of leather began to talk thus, 'It is true that the garden is beautiful, but it would be seven times more beautiful if ye would bring the world-sounding tree.' 'What must be done to get that? ' asked the little boy. 'Not other than this,' answered the old skeleton, 'In such and such a place, in an enchanted palace, is the world-sounding tree; but ye must go for it and bring it.' With that the old witch took farewell of the two children, and strolled home; but the boy had no peace from that hour. He wanted to go and bring the world-sounding tree; therefore taking farewell of his sister with bitter tear-shedding he set out for the tree. He was going and traveling across forty-nine kingdoms till he came to a dark castle; this was the first enchanted castle. A big, lame, hairy devil stood there on guard with a fearful whip, so that no man might enter. The hairy devil shouted very angrily at our boy, 'Stop! Who is there?' 'I,' answered the little boy. 'Who is I? Art thou Yanoshka? ' asked the devil. 'I am.' 'What journey art thou on?' 'I am looking for the world-beautifully sounding tree. Hast thou not heard of it, my lord elder brother?' 'I have not heard of it; but in such and such a place my brother stands guard, and if he has not heard of it, then no one in the world has.' Yanoshka went forward on the right road in search of the world-sounding tree. He traveled and journeyed till he came to another enchanted dark castle; there a big, lame, hairy devil was standing on guard who shouted to our Yanoshka in great anger. Our Yanoshka was much braver now, for he knew he had nothing to fear. 'Who is it?' called out the devil. 'I.' 'Art thou Yanoshka?' 'I am, at the service of my lord elder brother.' 'Why art thou journeying here in this strange land, where even a bird does not go?' 'I am looking for the world-beautifully sounding tree. Hast thou not heard of it, my lord elder brother?' 'What is the use in delay or denial? I have not heard; but in such and such a place my eldest brother is on guard, and if he knows nothing of it, then no one in the world knows.' With this Yanoshka moved on towards the third enchanted castle; when he came, there was a big, lame, hairy devil on guard, who called out in great anger to Yanoshka, 'Who is that?' 'I.' 'Thou art Yanoshka?' 'I am.' 'Why art thou journeying here in this strange land, where even a bird does not go?' 'I am looking for the world-beautifully sounding tree. Hast thou not heard of it, my lord elder brother?' 'Ho, ho, Yanoshka! of course I have; it is here in the garden of this enchanted palace. Thou mayest take it, but only if thou obey my words. If thou dost not value them or dost not observe them, thou wilt never see God's bright sky or the shining day again. I only want to say this: Here is a golden rod; strike the wall of the enchanted castle with it three times. Straightway a door will open before thee. In the very middle of the garden thou wilt find the world-beautifully sounding tree. Go around it three times and then hurry like a shot arrow, with the speed of a dog, or the stone wall will close, and thou wilt remain inside; and if thou art once shut in, God have mercy and pity on thee, for that instant thou wilt be turned to stone. This is my word and speech; if thou cling to it, thou wilt be lucky; if not, thou wilt be wretched forever.' The boy took the golden rod and struck the side of the enchanted castle with it. That instant the door opened before him. The king's son did not inquire much whether he might enter or not; in a moment he ran in through the door and straight to the garden. Every kind of singing and dancing maidens came to meet him, -- some with citharas and harps; some played on cymbals and begged him to play and dance with them; some offered rich food and drink of every kind agreeable to the taste. But the king's son had no mind to eat or drink; he pushed aside the maidens and ran to the very center of the garden, where the world-beautifully sounding tree was; then he went around it three times, turning toward the point whence he had come. That done he rushed from the garden, and a thousand times lucky was he. It was not the same for him to be a few minutes later, for the door closed and bit off the heel of his boot; but he did not care much about the heel of his boot. He ran home on the same road over which he had come; and when he arrived, the world-beautifully sounding tree was in the middle of the flowery garden. Hitherto the flowery garden had been in good fame, but now the fame was seven times greater, so that people came from seven worlds to look at the tree; and the report of it reached the king himself, who determined in his mind if he had not seen it yet he would now at least go to see it. As soon as the old witch divined his thought she put a powder in his coffee so that he became sick, and was not able to leave the room; then she stood before him without invitation, and said, 'High king, as thy Highness is sick, I will go to see if the world- sounding tree is as beautiful as reported, and will soon bring back word.' The king in one way or another agreed to the old witch's proposal, and let her go to see the world-beautifully sounding tree. She had barely put foot in the flowery garden when the two children ran out to her to hear what the old woman would say this time. 'Beautiful children,' said she, 'beautiful is the garden of itself, beautiful is the sounding tree, but still seven times more beautiful would it be if the world-sweetly speaking bird were to sing upon it.' 'What must I do?' asked the little boy. 'Nothing else,' answered the old witch, 'than this: In such and such a place is an enchanted castle, and thence it would be necessary to bring the world-sweetly speaking bird.' Then she went back; and from that hour the king's son could not remain at home, but planned to go for the world-sweetly speaking bird. Therefore, parting with his sister amidst bitter tear-shedding, he started through the kingdom and the world to bring home the sweetly speaking bird; but he enjoined on his sister that if the third day he were not at home, she should set out to seek him over a certain road, -- and with that the king's son went his way. He journeyed and traveled across forty-nine kingdoms to the first enchanted castle, where there stood on guard a big hairy devil, who had a terribly large whip in his hand, to kill, without pity or mercy, every man going up or down. Now, the hairy devil attacked Yanoshka sharply and roughly, thus, 'Who art thou?' 'I, my lord elder brother.' 'Who art thou?' asked the devil again. 'I.' 'Art thou Yanoshka?' 'I am.' 'Why art thou here in this strange land, where even a bird does not go?' 'I am going for the world-sweetly speaking bird. Hast thou heard of it, my lord elder brother?' 'What is the use in delay or denial? I have not indeed heard. But over there lives my elder brother; if he knows nothing of it, then no one in the world knows.' Now the king's son came to the second enchanted castle; the second devil sent him to his eldest brother, the big lame devil. When Yanoshka came to the third castle, the devil asked, 'Why art thou here in this strange land, where even a bird does not go?' 'I am looking for the world-sweetly speaking bird. Hast thou not heard of it, lord elder brother, in thy world-beautiful life?' 'Of course I have; it is here in this enchanted castle. Thou mayest take it away if thou wilt listen to my word; if not, better thou hadst never been born. For if thou wilt not observe my words, thou wilt never see God's bright sun again. I only wish to say: Here is a golden rod; take it, and with it strike the wall of the enchanted castle three times. Straightway the door will open before thee; pass in, run to the end of the glass corridor and across eight chambers. In the ninth chamber is the world-sweetly speaking bird in a rusty cage. Thou wilt find there every kind of beautiful and more beautiful golden birds, but look not at them, listen not to them, take no one of them, but take the sweetly speaking bird sitting sadly in the rusty cage. Snatch the cage in an instant, and rush from the enchanted castle as if thou hadst been shot from a cannon.' The king's son took the golden rod and struck the wall of the enchanted castle with it three times, and in a twinkle the door opened before him. The king's son then asked few questions. Whether it was permitted or not he ran into the room in an instant. While he was running to the end of the glass corridor he was called by name, from the right to the left, to stop. It is true that he was frightened, but he paid no heed. He ran straight to the first chamber. Every kind of flowers, more and more beautiful, were in golden pots; but the king's son did not touch them. He ran to the second chamber. In that were all kinds of swords and guns, but he did not choose from them. He entered the third, fourth, fifth, and in this way till he came to the ninth chamber. The ninth chamber, as the devil had told him, was full of all kinds of golden and silver cages, and in them golden-feathered birds, more and more beautiful, were singing; but the world-sweetly speaking bird was drooping there sadly in a rusty cage, and was not singing. As the world-sweetly speaking bird was not golden-feathered like the others, it did not please the king's son, and he did not take it, but chose from among the many golden-feathered birds the prettiest, and wished to take that; but as he reached towards it, suddenly, in the twinkle of an eye, he was turned to stone, and the door of the stone wall closed before him. Now, the little princess every God-given day spread the table for her good brother, but he did not come. Every God-given evening she went out before the house and waited till nearly midnight; then she spread the bed for him, but he did not lie in it. So the first day passed, and the second, and the third, -- day after day, but still the dear brother came not; therefore the princess, crying and weeping, went out to look for her brother. She journeyed and traveled upon his trail till she came to the first enchanted castle, and the second, and at last the third. The devil there stood on guard, with a great whip like a chain, so as to strike on the head, without pity or mercy, everyone going up or down; and he shouted angrily at the little girl, ' Who art thou? ' 'I.' 'Thou art Marishka?' For meanwhile, let it be said, this was the name of the king's son's sister. 'I am.' 'Why art thou traveling in this strange land, where not even a bird goes?' 'I am looking for my brother. Hast thou not heard of him, lord elder brother?' 'Of course I have heard, -- of course! He is in this enchanted castle, turned into stone; he had to be, for he would not obey me. Thou wilt go that way, too, if thou wilt not hold to my word.' Now the little girl took the golden rod from the devil, who told her what to do with it, and struck the wall of the enchanted castle with it three times. The door opened before her in a twinkle, the princess ran in; but she looked neither to the right nor the left. She ran straight to the ninth chamber; there she took the rusty cage, struck her brother three times on the side with the rod, then ran as if shot from a cannon. And a thousand-fold was her luck that she did not delay an eye-twinkle longer, for the stone-wall door, as it was, cut the edge of her skirt off when it closed. The princess had barely come out of the enchanted castle when she heard behind her frightful thundering, hammering and blowing, swearing and cursing, with threats. They shouted after her, 'Wait, thou! This-and-that-kind-of-wretch, it will soon be bitter for thee!' But she did not turn to them; she ran like a hunted deer till she reached home. Who was waiting for her there? No one else but her dear brother. The brother and sister then put up the sweetly speaking bird on the world-beautifully sounding tree, and the sweetly speaking bird spoke, sang more sweetly than any cithara, so that whoever heard it became ten years younger. If the flowery garden had been famous before, it now stood in seven times greater fame, so that from seven kingdoms the people came to look at it; and the king, hearing of the fair fame of the flowery garden, resolved in his mind that, though he had not gone yet, he would go to see it now. The old witch barely divined this intention of the king when she gave him powders in black coffee, from which the king became so sick that this time, too, his visit to the beautiful garden came to nothing. And then the old woman, without invitation, stood before him, and said, 'High king, thou hast such a great desire to see the flowery garden, I will go at once, and bring back word if its beauty is as great as its fame.' The king agreed, and the old woman went to see the flowery garden. She had barely put foot in it when the two children ran out to meet her, received her very cordially, and did not know where to seat her. 'Beautiful children,' began the old sinner, 'the marble palace is beautiful, the flowery garden is beautiful, the world-sweetly speaking bird is beautiful; but the flowery garden would be still more beautiful if the silver lake were flowing in it, and in the lake golden fish were playing.' 'What must I do to get the lake?' asked the king's son. 'Only this,' answered the old skeleton. 'In a certain place, in an enchanted castle, is the world-silver lake, and in it the world-golden fish; it is only necessary to go for the silver lake, for the golden fish will come in it. All that is needed is to bring the lake.' Then the old woman took leave of the pair pleasantly, and went home. But the king's son from that day had no rest, so he took leave of his dear sister, and went out into the world for the silver lake. He traveled and journeyed across forty-nine kingdoms, and the Operentsia Sea, till he came to the first enchanted castle. A devil was guarding there, who sent him to his elder brother, and he to his eldest. The king's son arrived at the third enchanted palace. A devil stood guard there, with an enormous knotty club, to hit every man going up or down, without mercy or pity. 'God give thee good evening, my lord elder brother.' 'God receive thee, Yanoshka; whither art thou faring in this strange land, where not even a bird goes?' 'I am looking for the world-silver lake. Hast thou not heard of it, lord elder brother?' 'Of course I have heard, -- of course; it is here in this enchanted castle. But, my younger brother, thou wilt have to tie up thy drawers well if 't is thy wish to take that away; for if thou dost not obey my word, I tell thee, on my true soul, that thou wilt reach Pilate by supper-time. I wish to say this: Here is a golden rod; strike the side of the enchanted palace with it, and suddenly the door will open before thee, run in straight to the garden. Thou wilt hear thy name called, but listen not. Every kind of beautiful maiden will come before thee, offering meat and drink; but eat not, neither drink. Thou wilt find on the way every kind of rich thing, -- gold, silver, diamonds, -- but touch nothing. Then every kind of disgusting snake and toad will come out, but be not afraid; run straight to the silver lake, which flows in the garden, run around it three times towards home, and then run out as thou didst go in' Well, the king's son took the golden rod, struck the side of the enchanted castle three times, and the door opened before him; scarcely had he put foot inside when maidens called him by name. 'This way, this way, Yanoshka! Eat, drink, with relish, Yanoshka! This way, Yanoshka, my embracing two arms are open to thee, run no farther!' The king's son, as if deaf, did not listen, but ran farther. Then maidens more and more beautiful came before him. Some sprang at him, dangled their golden hair in his face; the king's son did not stop, but struck at them rudely, rushing on. He had barely left the maidens when he fell on to piles of treasure thrown in his way: beaten gold was piled high, and milk-white silver coin, -- here every kind of diamond ring, there swords set in diamonds; but the king's son touched nothing, and ran on. Then every kind of crawling, creeping thing swarmed around him, -- here hissing snakes, there warty toads. Yanoshka looked not under his feet, but ran till he came to the silver lake, around which he rushed three times, and went out as he had come. A thousand-fold was his fortune, for had he been an instant later the stone wall would have closed before him; as it was it took the heel off his boot, but he cared nothing for that. He left his boots there and ran home barefoot; when he reached home the silver lake was already flowing through the flowery garden, and in it all kinds of precious golden fish were jumping. Hitherto the marble palace and the flowery garden with the sounding tree and the sweetly speaking bird had been in fair fame, but now, when the silver lake was flowing through the garden, and golden fish playing in it, now I say their fame spoke to the seven worlds, and people came to look at them. When this reached the ears of the king he resolved that he would neither eat nor drink till he saw the marble palace with all its wonders. Though the old witch offered him black coffee repeatedly, the king did not take it; but sitting in the golden carriage with his wife, he drove to see the flowery garden. Scarcely had the king and queen entered the flowery garden when the brother and sister ran out before them, panting, and kissed their hands. 'Oh, father, this little girl is like thee!' cried the queen; 'She is thy carved second!' 'And the little boy looks like thee,' answered the king. Well, the king and the queen went around the garden in order, and they could not do justice to its beauty; when they saw the sounding tree and the sweetly speaking bird, they clapped their hands. The boy went up in a moment on the sounding tree, plucked from it a couple of golden apples, gave one to the king and the other to the queen, who could not praise sufficiently his kindness. Then the king and queen looked at the silver lake and the golden fish in it; they visited the marble palace, and went from chamber to chamber till they had gone through seven in order. The king and queen were unable to praise sufficiently the beauty of the rooms; but when they came to the most beautiful of all, the king found this to say, speaking speech, ' Well, my little servant, wilt thou not answer a question of mine?' 'And what is it?' asked the prince. 'I should like to know why that picture is covered with velvet, and what it depicts.' One word is not much, but the king's little son did not say that much; speechless he drew the velvet covering aside. The king and queen were amazed, and knew their own children, whom they had never seen before. One embraced one of them, and the other the other; they could not speak, but they wept and laughed, and then the world-sounding tree and the sweetly speaking bird were heard. Great was the rejoicing of every kind, but sad grew the old sinner when the king seized her, made her fast to a tree, and piled up beneath her a fire of sulfur.", "title": "The Hedgehog, the Merchant, the King, and the Poor Man", "id": 581}
{"label": "545B", "text": "There was one time in my dear city of Naples an old man who was as poor as poor could be. He was so wretched, so bare, so light, and with not a farthing in his pocket, that he went naked as a flea.  And being about to shake out the bags of life, he called to him his sons, Oratiello and Pippo, and said to them, 'I am now called upon by the tenor of my bill to pay the debt I owe to nature; and believe me I should feel great pleasure in leaving this abode of misery, but that I leave you here behind me, a pair of miserable fellows, without a stitch upon your backs, without so much as a fly can carry upon its foot; so that were you to run a hundred miles, not a farthing would drop from you. My ill fortune has indeed brought me to such beggary that I lead the life of a dog; for I have all along, as you well know, gaped with hunger and gone to bed without a candle. Nevertheless, now that I am dying, I wish to leave you some token of my love. So do you, Oratiello, who are my first-born, take the sieve that hangs yonder against the wall, with which you can earn your bread; and do you, little fellow, take the cat, and remember your daddy.'  So saying he began to whimper, and presently after said, 'God be with you, for it is night!'  Oratiello had his father buried by charity, and then took the sieve, and went riddling [sifting] here and there and everywhere to gain a livelihood; and the more he riddled the more he earned.  And Pippo, taking the cat, said, 'Only see now what a pretty legacy my father has left me! I, who am not able to support myself, must now provide for two. Whoever beheld such a miserable inheritance?'  But the cat, who overheard this lamentation, said to him, 'You are grieving without need, and have more luck than sense; but you little know the good fortune in store for you, and that I am able to make you rich if I set about it.'  When Pippo heard this, he thanked her pussyship, stroked her three or four times on the back, and commended himself warmly to her.  So the cat took compassion upon poor Gagliuso, and every morning she betook herself either to the shore of the Chiaja or to the Fishrock, and catching a goodly gray mullet, or a fine dory, she bagged it, and carried it to the king, and said, 'My lord Gagliuso, your majesty's most humble slave, sends you this fish with all reverence, and says, 'A small present to a great lord.''  Then the king with a joyful face, as one usually shows to those who bring a gift, answered the cat, 'Tell this lord, whom I do not know, that I thank him heartily.'  At another time the cat would run to the marshes or fields, and when the fowlers had brought down a blackbird, a snipe, or a lark, she caught it up, and presented it to the king with the same message.  She repeated this trick again and again, until one morning the king said to her, 'I feel infinitely obliged to this lord Gagliuso, and am desirous of knowing him, that I may make a return for the kindness he has shown me.'  And the cat replied, The desire of my lord Gagliuso is to give his life and blood for your majesty's crown, and tomorrow morning without fail, as soon as the sun has set fire to the stubble of the fields of air, he will come and pay his respects to you.'  So when the morning came the cat went to the king, and said to him, 'Sire, my lord Gagliuso sends to excuse himself for not coming; as last night some of his servants robbed him and ran off, and have not left him a single shirt to his back.'  When the king heard this, he instantly commanded his servants to take out of his wardrobe a quantity of clothes and linen, and sent them to Gagliuso; and before two hours had passed Gagliuso went to the palace, conducted by the cat, where he received a thousand compliments from the king, who made him sit beside him, and gave him a banquet that would amaze you.  While they were eating Gagliuso from time to time turned to the cat, and said to her, 'My pretty puss, prithee take care that those rags don't slip through our fingers.'  Then the cat answered, 'Be quiet, be quiet; don't be talking of these beggarly things.'  The king wishing to know what it was, the cat made answer that he had taken a fancy for a small lemon, whereupon the king instantly set out to the garden for a basketful. But Gagliuso returned to the same tune about the old clothes and shirts, and the cat again told him to hold his tongue. Then the king once more asked what was the matter, and the cat had another excuse ready to make amends for Gagliuso's rudeness.  At last when they had eaten and had chatted for some time of one thing and another, Gagliuso took his leave; and the cat stayed with the king, describing the worth, and the genius, and the judgment of Gagliuso, and, above all, the great wealth he had in the plains of Rome and Lombardy, which well entitled him to marry into the family of a crowned king.  Then the king asked what might be his fortune; and the cat replied that no one could ever count the movables, the immovables, and the household furniture of this immensely rich man, who did not even know what he possessed; and if the king wished to be informed of it, he had only to send people with her out of the kingdom, and she would prove to him that there was no wealth in the world equal to his.  Then the king called some trusty persons, and commanded them to inform themselves minutely of the truth; so they followed in the footsteps of the cat, who, as soon as they had passed the frontier of the kingdom, from time to time ran on before, under the pretext of providing refreshments for them on the road; and whenever she met a flock of sheep, a herd of cows, a troop of horses, or a drove of pigs, she would say to the herdsmen and keepers, 'Ho! Have a care! There's a troop of robbers coming to carry off everything in the country. So if you wish to escape their fury, and to have your things respected, say that they all belong to the lord Gagliuso, and not a hair will be touched.'  She said the same at all the farmhouses that she passed on the road; so that wherever the king's people came, they found the pipe tuned; for everything they met with, they were told, belonged to the lord Gagliuso. So at last they were tired of asking, and went back to the king, telling seas and mountains of the riches of lord Gagliuso. The king, hearing this report, promised the cat a good drink if she should manage to bring about the match; and the cat concluded the marriage. So Gagliuso came, and the king gave him his daughter and a large portion.  At the end of a month of festivities Gagliuso said he wished to take his bride to his estates; so the king accompanied them as far as the frontiers, and he went to Lombardy, where, by the cat's advice, he purchased a quantity of lands and territories, and became a baron.  Gagliuso, now seeing himself so extremely rich, thanked the cat more than words can express, saying that he owed his life and his greatness to her good offices, and that the ingenuity of a cat had done more for him than the wit of his father; therefore she might dispose of his life and property as she pleased; and he gave her his word that when she died, which he prayed might not be for a hundred years, he would have her embalmed and put into a golden coffin, and set in his own chamber, that he might keep her memory always before his eyes.  The cat listened to these lavish professions, and before three days were over she pretended to be dead, and stretched herself at her full length in the garden; and when Gagliuso's wife saw her, she cried out, 'O husband, what a sad misfortune! The cat is dead!'  'Devil die with her!' said Gagliuso. 'Better she than we!'  'What shall we do with her?' asked the wife.  'Take her by the leg,' said he, 'and fling her out of the window.'  Then the cat, who heard this fine reward when she least expected it, began to say, 'Is this the return you make for my taking you from beggary? Is this the thanks I get for freeing you from rags that you might have hung distaffs with? Is this my reward for having put good clothes on your back, and fed you well when you were a poor, starved, miserable, tatter-brogued ragamuffin? But such is the fate of him who washes an ass's head. Go, a curse upon all I have done for you! You are not worth spitting upon in the face. A fine gold coffin you had prepared for me! A fine funeral you were going to give me! Go now, serve, labor, toil, sweat, to get this fine reward! Unhappy is he who does a good deed in hopes of a return! Well was it said by the philosopher, 'He who lies down an ass, an ass he finds himself.' But let him who does most expect least. Smooth words and ill deeds deceive alike both wise and fools.'  So saying she threw her cloak about her, and went her way; and all that Gagliuso with the utmost humility could do to soothe her was of no avail. She would not return, but kept running on without ever turning her head about, and saying,  Heaven protect us from a rich man grown poor, And from a beggar who of wealth has got store.  The poor cat was compassionated beyond measure for seeing herself so ill rewarded; but one of those present observed, that she might have found some consolation in not being alone; for at the present day ingratitude has become a domestic evil; and there are many others also who, after they have worked and toiled, and spent their money, and ruined their health, to serve this race of ungrateful people, and have fancied them selves sure of another and a better reward than a golden coffin, find themselves destined to be buried in the hospital.", "title": "Gagliuso", "id": 582}
{"label": "706", "text": "Once upon a time there was a woman innkeeper who had a daughter. Whenever guests came there they said, 'The innkeeper is in truth the most beautiful woman in all the land.' But when they saw her daughter they could not take their eyes from her, and they said, 'The innkeeper is beautiful, but her daughter is much more beautiful.' The innkeeper was proud of her beauty and would liked to have been the most beautiful. It made her ill to hear people say that her daughter was more beautiful than she was. Every day the girl became more and more beautiful until the mother could no longer contain her envy and anger. She hired a man and ordered him to take the girl into the mountains and kill her. As proof he was to bring back her heart. The man took the girl into the mountains and told her what the mother had demanded. The girl wept bitterly, fell to her knees, and begged him to spare her young life. The man was moved and spared her life on the condition that she would go away into foreign lands and never again return home. He brought back a dog's heart to the innkeeper. Sadly the girl went into the wide world, arriving finally in a city where she remained for some time as a servant girl. However, she was always sad, thinking constantly about her homeland and her wicked mother. She could not believe that her mother could be so cruel, and said to herself, 'For sure she is filled with regret and now weeps sorrowfully and silently because of my presumed death.' Finally she no longer could withstand her longing, and she set forth for her homeland. Her mother received her with angry surprise. The proud woman summoned the man once again and reproved him for his previous disobedience. Once again she told him to take the girl into the mountains and kill her. This time he was to bring back her chopped off hands as proof of her death. The man took the girl into the mountains, and she again fell to her knees and begged him to spare her life. The man was indeed moved, but he feared the innkeeper's anger. 'What can I do?' he said. 'Your mother has demanded that I bring her your hands. I have to obey her.' The girl looked painfully toward heaven and said, 'I would sooner lose my hands than my life. Chop off my hands, but spare my life!' She laid her hands onto a tree stump, and the horrible thing happened. The man helped her to bind up her bleeding arms, than told her to go far away, making her swear that she never again would return home. In unspeakable pain the girl went far into the dark woods. She prayed that God might heal her and protect her, and her prayer was not in vain. Soon her wounds began to heal, and she found nourishment from herbs, roots, and fruits of the forest. The wild animals did not threaten her life. At first she lived in a cave, but then she found an old willow tree with a rotten inside. With great difficulty and stress she hollowed it out. Here she was better protected against heat, cold, and wild animals. When her wounds pained her, and she despaired over what might become of her, she prayed and wept, and her prayers and tears comforted her. An inner voice cried out to her, 'God will not forsake you!' Even the poorest and the most miserable individual who listens to and believes in such a voice will find comfort. One day it happened that the king's son from a somewhat distant city who was hunting in these mountains became separated from his companions. Wandering alone through the woods he suddenly caught sight of the beautiful maiden. At first he thought it was a beautiful, strange animal. Wanting to capture it alive, he did not shoot an arrow at it. When she saw him, she ran away like a deer. He chased after her and saw that she fled into the hollow willow tree. He approached it and commanded her to step outside. To his surprise he saw a beautiful maiden with chopped off hands standing before him. 'Who are you, my child, and why are you here? Who cut off your hands?' She wept and said nothing. Falling in love with her, he said, 'I see that you must have fallen into the hands of wicked people. I will rescue you. Now you shall experience better days. Come with me into the city.' Then he blew into his hunting horn, and it sounded through the woods, echoing from the cliffs. Not long afterward his companions and servants approached. They fashioned a litter. The prince lifted the maiden onto it and covered her with his cloak. After arriving at the palace in the city he had rooms made ready for her, then provided her with servants and costly clothing and took care of her in the best possible manner. One day he went to her and asked her if she did not want to become his wife. She blushed and said, 'That cannot be.' Sadly, he asked her why. 'How can I, a poor girl without hands become your wife?' she replied. 'What would your mother say?' 'Don't worry about that,' he said. 'I am my own master and follow my heart's voice, which tells me that you will make me happy. I love you truly and sincerely, even if you cannot love me.' Hearing these words, her face turned fire-red and her heart beat loudly. She dropped to her knees before him and covered his hands with kisses and hot tears. 'You are now my bride before God and before the people,' he cried with joy. Lifting her up he pressed a kiss onto her pure white forehead. The he went to his mother and explained to her that he wanted to marry the maiden. The mother was a proud woman and for a long time had secretly assumed that her son would marry the world's most beautiful and wealthiest princess. Therefore the prince's proposal made her exceedingly angry. 'Are you out of your mind?' she shouted at him. 'You want to make a vagabond low-class girl without hands into my daughter-in-law and the people's queen?' But the prince remained steadfast. He forced his mother to tame, or at least to hide her anger, and he wed the maiden. The people did not complain; to the contrary, they loved the young queen more and more, for in a short time she did more for them without hands than the old queen had done for them in her entire lifetime with her healthy hands. The couple's happiness lasted only a few months, for war broke out, and the prince had to go to battle with his army. He ordered all his servants to care for his wife and to assure that no harm would come to her. Then he fondly bad her farewell and departed with his army. More months passed by, and the young queen gave birth to two beautiful boys. The old queen was beside herself with anger and would have pulled the children away from her, but the servants, true to their master, kept watch over the young queen and her children, not leaving them alone for even a moment. The old queen sent a trusted messenger to the prince with the claim that his wife had given birth to two children that looked like dogs. The people were revolting, and he therefore should order what was to be done. She believed that her son would give the order to have the young mother and her children killed, but she was wrong. The prince ordered that no one should do anything to his wife or the children until after he had returned home. This angered the old queen all the more, and she sent the same messenger to the prince with the claim that the people were threatening a revolution, and that she therefore saw no other remedy but to publicly burn to death the young mother and her children. And she would have had this done, but the young queen discovered her plan in time. In the middle of the night she took both children into her arms and secretly fled from the palace and from the city. 'God will not abandon me and my poor little ones!' she thought as she went on her way. She walked until she came to a valley in a forest wilderness. Then two honorable men approached her and asked, 'Have these children been baptized?' 'No,' she replied and then told them of her escape and of her difficulties. Then the one man said, 'I'll baptize the children. What names shall I give them?' 'Whatever ones you like,' she said. 'Good,' replied the man. 'The one shall be named Johannes and the other one Joseph.' And he baptized them with the water from the river that flowed through the valley. The two men were none other than Saint Johannes and Saint Joseph themselves. Then the first man said, 'Take your children to the far edge of the valley. There you will find a lovely house supplied with everything that you need for yourself and your children. Do not leave the house, and do not open the door for anyone unless he addresses you by the five wounds of our savior.' Relieved, she promised this, thanked he men graciously, and went on her way. She than came upon a beautiful woman who looked at her kindly and said, 'My poor woman, you have no hands.' The young mother wept. The beautiful woman was none other than Saint Mary, and she said, 'Stick your arms into the water of this river.' She did this, and when she pulled her arms out, she once again had her healthy hands. Weeping with joy she thanked heavenly woman, who then said to her in parting, 'Go to that house and faithfully heed what the two saints have told you. Then things will go well for you and your children, for you have always been pious and in your need have trusted in heaven. With a joyful heart she went on her way and found the promised house. There they remained by themselves, for no other human soul was to be found near and far. There she had everything that she needed. The two boys grew and were soon running cheerfully around in the woods. The mother kept her promise, and they were pious and good, praying morning and evening to God that he would bless and protect them. Six years passed. Meanwhile the prince had returned from the wars and had become king. He was always sad, for he often thought about his wife and his children, who he assumed were dead. He had banned his mother from the court. One time he went hunting and lost his way in the woods. Night was approaching and it had begun to storm. Without success he sought shelter beneath the old trees; the wind whipped rain into his face, it thundered without pause, and lightning lit up the entire area. Then he saw the house where his wife and children were living. He knocked on the door, but no one opened it for him. The weather became more and more angry, and lighting struck once again. In great fear he cried out, 'By the five wounds of our savior, open the door!' Hearing these words, the queen opened the door and let him enter. 'Give me shelter for the night,' he cried out. 'I am dead tired and soaked through.' She recognized him immediately. He too thought that this was he wife, and he wanted to cry out with joy, but the sight of her hands told him that he was mistaken, for his wife had no hands. She controlled herself and did not tell him who she was. She led him to the hearth, stirred up the flames, and brought food and drink to him. At first two children did not dare look at the strange man, for until now they had never seen a human being, except for their mother. Finally, encouraged by their mother they shyly approached the stranger, then, snuggled against their mother's arms, they stared at him with wide-open eyes, and he looked back with kindness. With tears in his eyes he thought, 'My children would be just this age, if they were still alive.' The king sat by the fire and dried his clothes. Then sleep overcame him, and he closed his eyes. Seeing that he was asleep, she told her children that this man was their father. Therefore, when he awoke, they should be very friendly toward him. Then it happened that the sleeping king's hat fell off his head to the floor. 'Johannes,' said the mother, 'pick up your father's hat.' The boy obeyed. The king was half awake and heard what was said. 'What is this?' he thought to himself. 'I'll pretend to be asleep and let my hat fall again.' A little later the hat fell to the floor again. 'Joseph,' said the mother, 'pick up your father's hat.' Hearing this, the king got up and said, 'Woman, why do you call me father?' She smiled and said, 'Look at me closely!' He broke out in tears and said, 'Yes, you look like dear wife, but it is not possible that you are she, for my dear wife had no hands.' She cried out, 'But it is possible, my beloved husband. God has given me back my hands, and these boys are your children. Then they embraced one another until their hearts almost broke for joy. He took the two boys into his arms and could not stop looking at them and kissing them; all the while tears of joy were running down his cheeks. They stayed together the entire night, telling each other what had happened to them. The next morning he wanted to take her and the boys to the city, but she said, 'My dear husband, the saints have commanded that I remain here forever, and I must obey them.' He did not object, but kissed her and the boys in parting, and said, 'I'll come back to you soon.' He returned to the city. There he gave up the crown and the kingship, sold all of his belongings, chose the most faithful of his servants, then returned to his wife and his children. They lived together many long years in that beautiful, peaceful mountain valley. They enjoyed in the largest measure that happiness which mankind can only achieve through sacred peace of mind.", "title": "The Girl without Hands (Schneller)", "id": 583}
{"label": "510A", "text": "And the fairy said, 'Why dost thou cry, little Orange?' Orange said, 'Because I have broken our pitcher, and mother will beat me.' 'Dry up thy tears,' said the fairy, 'and see, I live in the well and know all about you, and I will help you, because thou art such a good little girl, and so ill used.' Then the fairy struck the ground, and the pitcher came back out of the well sound and whole, and just as it was before, except that it had arms and legs. 'See,' said the fairy, 'this little pitcher shall always be thy friend, and now it will walk home with thee and carry the water itself. Go home now, tell it to nobody, and be a good little girl.' Having said this the fairy disappeared down the well. After this Orange soon dried up her tears, and, taking hold of the pitcher's hand, she and the pitcher walked home together. But when they got to the door of her mother's house the arms and legs of the pitcher were gone. Then Orange took the pitcher into the house, and, remembering what the fairy had said, told what had happened to nobody. The next morning Orange awoke very early, as she always did, and said to herself, 'How tired I shall be before night comes, for there is so much work to do in the house.' So she got up, and when she came downstairs she found the pitcher, with its arms and legs on, sweeping the kitchen and doing all the hard work, and ever after the pitcher was her faithful and helpful friend.", "title": "The Broken Pitcher", "id": 584}
{"label": "1641", "text": "Once upon a time there was a poor peasant by the name of Crab who drove two oxen with a load of wood into town where he sold it to a doctor for two thalers. He received his money just as the doctor was sitting down to eat. When the peasant saw how well the doctor ate and drank, his heart took a longing for the same things, and he decided that he would like to have been a doctor. He stood there for a while, and then asked if he too could not become a doctor. 'Certainly,' said the doctor, 'in no time at all.' 'What do I have to do?' asked the peasant. First of all, buy yourself an ABC-book, one that has a picture of a rooster up front. Second, sell your wagon and your two oxen and buy yourself some clothing and other things that doctors use. Third, have yourself a sign painted with the words 'I am Doctor Know-All' and nail it above the door to your house.' The peasant did everything he was told to do. After he had doctored a little -- but not very much -- some money was stolen from a great and wealthy nobleman. Someone told him about the Doctor Know-All who lived in such and such a village, and who must know where the money had gone. So the nobleman had his carriage hitched up, rode out to the village, and asked him if he were Doctor Know-All. 'Yes, that I am.' 'Then you must come with me and recover my stolen money.' 'Yes, but my wife Grete must come along too.' The nobleman agreed and had them take their places in his carriage. They rode away together. They arrived at the nobleman's court just at mealtime, and the nobleman invited him to eat. 'Yes, but include my wife Grete,' he replied, and the two of them sat down behind the table. When the first servant brought out a platter of fine food the peasant nudged his wife and said, 'Grete, that's the first one,' meaning the meal's first course. However, the servant thought that he meant, 'That's the first thief,' and because that is indeed what he was, he took fright, and outside he said to his comrades, 'The doctor knows everything. It's going to go badly for us. He said that I'm the first one.' The second one did not want to go inside at all, but finally he had to, and when he entered, the peasant nudged his wife and said, 'Grete, that's the second one.' This servant took fright as well, and went outside. It did not go any better for the third one. Once again the peasant said, 'Grete, that's the third one.' The fourth one brought in a covered platter, and the nobleman told the doctor that he should demonstrate his art by guessing what it contained. It was crabs. The peasant looked at the platter, and seeing no way out of his dilemma, he said to himself, 'Oh, poor Crab!' Hearing this, the nobleman called out, 'If he knows that then he must know who has the money as well!' The servant grew very fearful and motioned to the doctor to go outside. There all four of them confessed to him that they had stolen the money. They offered to give it all to him and a handsome sum in addition, if he would not turn them in. Otherwise they would all hang. They showed him where the money was hidden. The doctor was satisfied with this, and he went back inside and sat down again at the table. 'My lord,' he said, 'Now I will look in my book to see where the money is hidden. However, the fifth servant climbed into the stove in order to hear if the doctor knew anything else. The doctor leafed back and forth in his book looking for the picture of the rooster. Not finding it, he said, 'I know that you are in there. Come on out.' The man in the stove thought that the doctor was talking to him, and terrified, he jumped out, saying, 'The man knows everything!' Then Doctor Know-All showed the nobleman where the money was, but he did not tell who had stolen it. Thus he received a large reward from each side and became a famous man.

Now such butter was dear in those parts and the devotee laid all that came to him together in a jar he had, till he filled it and hung it up over his head for safekeeping. One night, as he sat on his bed staff in hand, he fell a-musing upon the butter and the greatness of its price and said in himself: I sell all this butter I have accumulated and with the proceeds buy a ewe. The first year she will bear a male lamb and a female and the second a female and a male and these in their turn will bear other males and other females. The males I will sell and buy with them bulls and cows, which will also increase and multiply; after which I will purchase a piece of land and plant a garden therein and build thereon a fine palace. Moreover, I will purchase robes and raiment and slaves and slave-girls, and then hold a wedding exceeding all that have ever been seen. I will slaughter cattle and make rich meats and confections and assemble all the musicians and mimes and performers and invite rich and poor to the celebration. Lastly I will go in to my bride, after her unveiling and enjoy her beauty and loveliness. In due time my wife will bear me a boy, and I shall rejoice in him and make banquets in his honor and rear him daintily and teach him philosophy and mathematics and polite letters, so that I shall make his name renowned among men and glory in him among the assemblies of the learned; and I will bid him do good and he shall not contradict me, and I will forbid him from lewdness and iniquity and exhort him to piety and the practice of righteousness; and, I will bestow on him rich and goodly gifts. I will reward his obedience with rich gifts, but if I should ever see him incline to disobedience, I will come down on him with this staff. So saying, he raised his hand to beat his son, but the staff hit the jar of butter hanging above his head, and broke it.

{"label": "777", "text": "The supposed origin of the 'Flying Dutchman' is that a vessel from Batavia was on the point of entering Table Bay in stress of weather during the Dutch occupation os the Cape, when in the winter season, no vessel was allowed to enter the bay: the batteries fired on the distressed ship, and compelled it to put to sea, where it was lost, and as the sailors say has continued ever since beating about, and will continue to do so till the day of judgment. The 'Dutchman' is said to appear generally to ships in a heavy gale, with all sail set -- and when the eastern navigator is in a calm, the Dutchman appears to be scudding under bare poles. As many persons think such an apparition the creation of fancy, I give the following statement which was noted down in the logbook of his Majesty's ship Leven, when employed with the Barracouta, &c, in surveying East Africa, and in the dangers and disaster of which squadron I participated. His Majesty's ship Leven, Capt. W. F. W. Owen, on the 6th April, 1823, when off Point Danger, on her voyage from Algoa to Simon's Bay, saw her consort the Barracouta about two miles to leeward; this was considered extraordinary as her sailing orders would have placed her in a different direction; but her peculiar rig left no doubt as to her identity, and at last many well known faces were distinctly visible looking towards the Leven. Capt. Owen attempted to close with her to speak, but was surprised that she not only made no effort to join the Leven, on the contrary stood away: being near the destined port, Capt. Owen did not follow her, and continued on his course to the Cape, but at sunset she was observed to heave to and lower a boat, apparently for the purpose of picking up a man overboard; during the night there was no light nor any symptoms of her locality. The next morning, the Leven anchored in Simon's Bay where for a whole week the Barracouta was anxiously expected. On her arrival (the 14th) it was seen by her log, that she was 300 miles from the Leven, when the latter thought she saw her, and had not lowered any boat that evening; it should also be remarked that no other vessel of the same class was ever seen about the Cape. On another occasion a similar phenomenon was witnessed by the Leven, and a boat was apparently lowered as is generally the case when the phantom seeks to lure his victim. The veteran sailor was not however, to be caught,* and the Leven after many perils, reached England in safety. *It is said that any vessel which the 'Dutchman' can get his letters on board of is certain to be lost. Thrice as a passenger in a merchant ship, I saw a vessel in nearly similar circumstances: on one occasion we hoisted lights over the gang-way to speak with the stranger; the third time was my recent return from India. We had been in 'dirty weather,' as the sailors say, for several days, and to beguile the afternoon I commenced after dinner narrating to the French officers and passengers (who were strangers to the Eastern seas), the stories current about the 'Flying Dutchman.' The wind, which had been freshening during the evening, now blew a stiff gale, and we proceeded on deck to see the crew make our bark all snug for the night. The clouds, dark and heavy, coursed with rapidity across the moon, whose lustre is peculiar in the S. hemisphere, and we could see a distance of from eight to ten miles on the horizon. Suddenly the second officer, a fine Marseilles sailor, who had been among the foremost in the cabin in laughing at and ridiculing the story of the 'Flying Dutchman,' ascended the weather rigging, exclaiming, 'Voila le volant Hollandais!' The captain sent for his night glass, and soon observed, 'It is very strange, but there is a ship bearing down upon us with all sail set, while we dare scarcely show a pocket-handkerchief to the breeze.' In a few minutes the stranger was visible to all on deck; her rig plainly discernible, and people on her poop; she seemed to near us with the rapidity of lightning, and apparently wished to pass under our quarter, as if for the purpose of speaking. The captain, a resolute Bordeaux mariner, said it was quite incomprehensible, and sent for the trumpet to hail or answer, when in an instant, and while we were all standing on the qui vive, the stranger totally disappeared, and was no more seen. I give this, coupled with Capt. Owen's statement as regards H. M. S. Leven, without remark, and, but that it would seem frivolous, could relate several other instances. The reader will, I hope, excuse this digression, which could not well be avoided in treating of the Cape of Good Hope, whose name is almost associated with that of the 'Flying Dutchman.' li>This account was reprinted in: Army and Navy Chronicle, vol. 3, no. 26 (Washington: December 29, 1836), p. 406.", "title": "The Flying Dutchman", "id": 587}
{"label": "20C", "text": "In the yard he passed the house dog who was sitting in front of his kennel. 'Hallo, Chaton!' cried the dog. 'Where are you going to in such a hurry?' 'I am fleeing the country,' answered Chaton. 'I have just heard the sounding of the last trump! The end of the world is at hand!' 'If that is so,' said the dog, 'I would like to run away too. May I come with you?' 'Certainly,' answered Chaton. 'Seat yourself on my beautiful curly tail.' So the dog perched himself on the cat s tail, and off they went together. A little farther on they came to the farm gate, and there, perched on the topmost rail, was the cock. 'Whither away, Chaton?' asked the cock. 'You seem to be in haste.' 'Yes,' said Chaton. 'I have heard the last trump, which proves that the world is coming to an end, and I want to get safely away before that happens.' 'Take me with you, Chaton dear,' said the cock. 'By all means,' answered the cat. 'Jump on to my beautiful curly tail beside the dog.' So the cock perched himself on Chaton's tail, and now there were two passengers. Away went the cat even faster than before, so as to make up for lost time, and presently they passed a rabbit who was nibbling the grass in a field. 'Chaton, Chaton,' cried the rabbit, 'why are you running so quickly?' 'Don't stop me!' answered the cat. 'I've heard the last trump! The end of the world is coming!' 'Oh, dear me!' cried the rabbit. 'What an unfortunate thing! Don't leave me here, Chaton, for I am afraid to face the end of the world.' 'Very well,' said Chaton. 'Jump on to my beautiful curly tail with the dog and the cock, and I'll take you with me.' So the rabbit also perched himself on the cat's tail, and now there were three of them riding there. Off went the cat again, but not so quickly this time, because of the weight on his tail, and before very long he came to a pond by the side of which a goose was standing. 'Now then, now then, what's the hurry?' asked the goose. 'If you run so fast you'll overheat your blood and die of a fever.' 'It's all very well to scoff,' answered the cat, 'but you must know that the end of the world is coming. I have heard the last trump sound!' 'My goodness!' said the goose. 'This is dreadful! Take me with you, Chaton, and I'll be grateful for ever.' 'Very well,' said the cat. 'Jump on to my beautiful curly tail with the dog and the fox and the rabbit.' So the goose also perched herself on the cat's tail, so now there were four passengers, and that made five altogether who were running away to escape the end of the world. All that day the cat kept on running, and towards dusk they came to a forest. 'This seems a good place to rest,' said Chaton. 'Now then, master cock, fly to the top of a tree and see if you can espy a house in which we can take shelter.' The cock flew to the top of a high tree and from there he saw a number of lights twinkling in the distance. The five fugitives thereupon set off in the direction from which the lights shone, and before long they came to a little village. All the people of the village had left their houses and were gathered together in the square, round a man dressed all in red, with a big red feather in his cap, who was addressing them. Chaton and his companions pressed close to the edge of the crowd and were just in time to hear these words: 'Whoever finds the ring,' said the man with the red feather,' and places it on the table in my palace tomorrow before dawn, shall have the five bags of gold which hang on my saddle bow.' Having said this, the man in red mounted his horse and rode away. Chaton went up to a little peasant who was standing in the crowd. 'Tell me, gossip,' said he, 'who is the man with the red feather, and what's all this about a ring and five bags of gold?' 'Why,' said the peasant, 'the man in red is the king of this country. He had a valuable ring which was kept in a tiny wooden case on the table by his bed. This afternoon a magpie flew in through the window, snatched up the case, and bore it away to its nest in the topmost boughs of the walnut tree on the village green. The king wants his ring back again, and will give the five bags of gold to anybody who will recover it for him.' 'I see,' said Chaton; 'and why don't you climb the walnut tree and get the ring?' 'Because I have too much respect for my neck,' answered the peasant, 'and so has everybody else here. The boughs at the top of the tree where the nest is are so thin and slender that they would not bear the weight of a child, let alone a grown man. Gold is good, but whole limbs are better, that's what I say!' 'And I!' 'And I!' echoed other villagers who had been listening to this conversation. 'In my belief you are quite right,' said Chaton seriously. 'Let the king risk his own life if he is so anxious to recover his ring.' But afterwards, when he had withdrawn with his companions to the shelter of the wood, he sang a different tune. 'My friends,' said he, 'our fortunes are made! As soon as all is quiet I will climb the tree and get the ring; then you shall sit on my tail again and we'll all go off together to the king's palace and get the bags of gold!' He danced for joy, and the dog and the cock and the goose and the rabbit danced with him. An hour afterwards the cat climbed the tree and came down safely with the little wooden box. The rabbit gnawed it open with his teeth, and sure enough there was the ring inside it. 'Now,' said Chaton, 'we will all go to the king's palace, but I am very tired with running all day. I propose that the dog takes a turn at carrying us.' This was agreed. The other four got on to the dog's back and clung there while he ambled off as fast as he could along the road towards the palace. Just before dawn they came to a wide river. Now it was the turn of the goose to work for the common good. She was quite used to the water, and one by one she took the other animals across on her back. Shortly afterwards they arrived at the king's palace, and the cock flew up through the open window of the king's room with the ring in his beak, and placed it on the table by the bed. Then he awoke the king with a loud crow and claimed the reward, which was willingly given. In great glee at their good fortune the animals went on their way, each with his bag of gold, and every one of them had by this time quite forgotten his fear about the coming of the end of the world. They went on and on until they came to a place where five ways met. Then Chaton said, 'Here we are at the parting of the ways. Let us each choose a road, and part good friends.' At this moment there came along a pig with a knife and fork stuck in his back. In his right ear was salt; in his left ear pepper, and mustard was on his tail, so that everybody who was hungry had only to cut themselves a slice of meat and sit down to feast. Our friends gladly availed themselves of this good chance, and I who tell you this story would willingly have done the same, but as soon as I went up to the pig, he ran at me with his head down and sent me flying through the air, and through the window of my house, where I fell into the chair in which I am now sitting, finishing this story of the wonderful adventures of Chaton, the dog, the cock, the rabbit, and the goose.", "title": "The End of the World (Flanders)", "id": 588}
{"label": "130", "text": "There was a farmer before now who had a White Pet (sheep), and when Christmas was drawing near, he thought that he would kill the White Pet. The White Pet heard that, and he thought he would run away; and that is what he did. He had not gone far when a bull met him. Said the bull to him, 'All hail! White Pet, where are you going?' 'I,' said the White Pet, 'am going to seek my fortune; they were going to kill me for Christmas, and I thought I had better run away.' 'It is better for me,' said the bull, 'to go with you, for they were going to do the very same with me.' 'I am willing,' said the White Pet; 'the larger the party the better the fun.' They went forward until they fell in with a dog. 'All hail! White Pet,' said the dog. 'All hail! dog.' 'Where are you going?' said the dog. 'I am running away, for I heard that they were threatening to kill me for Christmas.' 'They were going to do the very same to me,' said the dog, 'and I will go with you.' 'Come, then,' said the White Pet. They went then, until a cat joined them. 'All hail! White Pet,' said the cat. 'All hail! oh cat.' 'Where are you going?' said the cat. 'I am going to seek my fortune,' said the White Pet, ' because they were going to kill me at Christmas.' 'They were talking about killing me too,' said the cat,' and I had better go with you.' 'Come on then,' said the White Pet. Then they went forward until a cock met them. 'All hail! White Pet,' said the cock. 'All hail to yourself! oh cock,' said the White Pet. 'Where,' said the cock,' are you going?' 'I,' said the White Pet, 'am going away, for they were threatening my death at Christmas.' 'They were going to kill me at the very same time,' said the cock, ' and I will go with you.' 'Come, then,' said the White Pet. They went forward until they fell in with a goose. 'All hail! White Pet,' said the goose. 'All hail to yourself! oh goose,' said the White Pet. 'Where are you going?' said the goose. 'I,' said the White Pet, 'am running away, because they were going to kill me at Christmas.' 'They were going to do that to me too,' said the goose, 'and I will go with you.' The party went forward until the night was drawing on them, and they saw a little light far away; and though far off, they were not long getting there. When they reached the house they said to each other that they would look in at the window to see who was in the house, and they saw thieves counting money; and the White Pet said, 'Let every one of us call his own call. I will call my own call; and let the bull call his own call; let the dog call his own call; and the cat her own call; and the cock his own call; and the goose his own call.' With that they gave out one shout -- Gaire! When the thieves heard the shouting outside, they thought the mischief was there; and they fled out, and they went to a wood that was near them. When the White Pet and his company saw that the house was empty, they went in and they got the money that the thieves had been counting, and they divided it among themselves; and then they thought that they would settle to rest. Said the White Pet, 'Where will you sleep tonight, oh bull?' 'I will sleep,' said the bull, 'behind the door where I used to be.' 'Where will you sleep, White Pet?' 'I will sleep,' said the White Pet, 'in the middle of the floor where I used to be.' 'Where will you sleep, oh dog?' said the White Pet. 'I will sleep beside the fire where I used to be,' said the dog. 'Where will you sleep, oh cat?' 'I will sleep,' said the cat, 'in the candle press, where I like to be.' 'Where will you sleep, oh cock?' said the White Pet. 'I,' said the cock, ' will sleep on the rafters where I used to be.' 'Where will you sleep, oh goose?' 'I will sleep,' said the goose, 'on the manure pile, where I was accustomed to be.' They were not long settled to rest, when one of the thieves returned to look in to see if he could perceive if any one at all was in the house. All things were still, and he went on forward to the candle press for a candle, that he might kindle to make him a light; but when he put his hand in the box the cat thrust her claws into his hand, but he took a candle with him, and he tried to light it. Then the dog got up, and he stuck his tail into a pot of water that was beside the fire; he shook his tail and put out the candle. Then the thief thought that the mischief was in the house, and he fled; but when he was passing the White Pet, he gave him a blow; before he got past the bull, he gave him a kick; and the cock began to crow; and when he went out, the goose began to belabor him with his wings about the shanks. He went to the wood where his comrades were, as fast as was in his legs. They asked him how it had gone with him. 'It went,' said he, 'but middling; when I went to the candle press, there was a man in it who thrust ten knives into my hand; and when I went to the fireside to light the candle, there was a big black man lying there, who was sprinkling water on it to put it out; and when I tried to go out, there was a big man in the middle of the floor, who gave me a shove; and another man behind the door who pushed me out; and there was a little brat on the loft calling out Cuir-anees-an-shaw-ay-s-foni-mi-hayn-da -- Send him up here and I'll do for him; and there was a shoemaker, out on the manure pile, belaboring me about the shanks with his apron.' When the thieves heard that, they did not return to seek their lot of money; and the White Pet and his comrades got it to themselves; and it kept them peaceably as long as they lived.", "title": "The Story of the White Pet", "id": 589}

She is distinguished from earthly vessels by bearing a press of sail when all others are unable, from stress of weather, to show an inch of canvass. The cause of her wandering is not altogether certain; but the general account is, that she was originally a vessel loaded with great wealth, on board of which some horrid act of murder and piracy had been committed; that the plague broke out among the wicked crew who had perpetrated the crime, and that they sailed in vain from port to port, offering, as the price of shelter, the whole of their ill-gotten wealth; that they were excluded from every harbour, for fear of the contagion which was devouring them, and that, as a punishment of their crimes, the apparition of the ship still continues to haunt those seas in which the catastrophe took place, and is considered by the mariners as the worst of all possible omens.", "title": "The D\u00e6mon-Frigate", "id": 590}
{"label": "779", "text": "In the beginning of the fourteenth century a poor widow lived just outside the Doven Gate [in Bremen] in the vicinity of Jodenberg. She occupied a cottage that had been given to her by the wealthy Frau Schwanke, the wife of Conrad von Verden. For many long years she had served Frau Schwanke's parents as a faithful and industrious maid, and for this reason Frau Schwanke provided her with various means of support, even in her old age. To be sure, the old widow had a daughter who was married to a wealthy tanner in the city, but the daughter had a hard and proud personality, and when the council at that time gave tanners the right to have their own guild in the future, the devil of arrogance so overcame the tanner-master's wife that she became ashamed of her mother, and in the end she even forbade her to enter her house. The old woman was slow and frail, and she could no longer manage to provide for herself, even by spinning. She would have perished had it not been for the help of others. But this help came to a terrible end when Conrad von Verden, who together with his wealthy cousins had committed a number of acts of violence, was driven from the city along with all of his relatives. The old woman could no longer take her pot to Frau Schwanke to get leftovers from their noon meal, as she had been accustomed to do for a year and a day. Bitter necessity now drove her to turn to her daughter for charity. It was a difficult step for her. With a shaking hand she reached for the staff which for a long time now she had been forced to rely on to support her unsteady gait. Underway she stopped several times. She feared an angry confrontation with her daughter, and reflected if it would not be better to take her problems to someone other than her own child. Suddenly she found herself standing in front of her son-in-law's house. She hesitated another moment, then took courage and stepped inside. 'After all, she is my daughter, my only child,' she murmured quietly to herself. 'God and Saint Willhadus will soften her harshness.' She entered the parlor, where the entire family had gathered to eat their noon meal. At first she was very embarrassed, standing there in her poor clothing surrounded by expensive household furnishings and utensils, and she struggled unsuccessfully for words with which to express her plea. Having collected herself somewhat, she most movingly described in simple and unassuming language the hopelessness of her plight. Tears came to her son-in-law's eyes, but he was a weak man who was completely dominated by his wife, and for nothing in the world would he have made an independent decision, directed only by his heart. He would have taken the helpless old woman into his house with pleasure, if it had depended upon him alone. But as it was, he cast a questioning glance toward his wife to assure himself of her approval. Fear overcame him when he saw her face. It was nothing new for him that she should become angry, even in unimportant matters, but never before had he seen such fury, such an ugly distortion of her features. It was as though upon the sight of her mother she had become possessed of an evil spirit. The redness of her raging anger gave way to a corpse-like paleness. With sparking animal-like eyes she appeared to want to penetrate the being to whom she owed her life and existence and who had protected her with maternal nurture in her youth and had cared for her in sickness. Terrified, the old woman looked around for a chair, for her strength threatened to leave her. For a moment the man's human feelings overcame his fear of his wife, and he rushed forward to catch the half-unconscious woman. Until now the tanner-master's wife had sat there quietly without saying a word, or without even moving. But now her anger suddenly exploded like a crashing thunder-storm that had been threatening in the skies for some time. With superhuman strength she pushed her husband aside and like a wild animal threw herself furiously at her own mother, in order to punish her for having dared to come here, although she had been expressly forbidden to do so. Striking at her with her fists, she finally drove her out of the parlor door. The old woman lay on the hallway floor with her face to the ground. She did not move, and the daughter's demands that she stand up were in vain. The daughter's unnatural anger suddenly dissipated at this pitiful sight. It was as though a curtain had been drawn from her eyes and that she could finally see whom she had directed her blind fury against. 'Mother!' she cried, horrified at what she had done. 'Forgive me! Come to your sinful and repentant daughter. Before God and all the saints, if the most tender attention and the most loving care can erase this terrible sin from your memory, then you shall forget it.' Gripped by the deepest sympathy, she bent over the unfortunate woman in order to lift her up. She wanted never again to be separated from her, never again to cause her concern. But this change of disposition came too late, and with horror she saw that she was wasting her loving caresses on a corpse. The tanner-master's wife was spared by an earthly judge, for it was determined that the old woman did not die only as a result of the attack, but even more from fear and terror. But there is also a judge who dwells above the clouds who does not make his determinations according to earthly expectations and sophistry. The tanner-master's wife died suddenly thereafter, and a few days after her burial, the gravedigger noticed with horror that the buried woman's hands -- with which she had attacked her mother -- were extending from the grave. And this miracle can be seen to this day, eternalized in stone in the ambulatory of the cathedral.", "title": "A Child's Hand That Wrongly Attacked a Mother Grows Out of the Grave", "id": 591}

{"label": "480", "text": "Holena sat around in idleness, while Marushka had to cook, wash, spin, weave, bring grass, and take care of the cow. She was willing to work; she didn't know why her mother hated her, but she bore reproaches with patience. At last the stepmother and her daughter thought only of how to get rid of poor Marushka. They tortured her with hunger, and beat her, but she endured it all and grew more beautiful each day. One day, in the middle of winter, Holena pretended to want violets, and she said to Marushka, 'Go to the woods and get me some violets. I want to put them in my belt and enjoy their perfume.' 'But, sister, what has come to your mind? I have never heard of violets blossoming in winter,' answered Marushka. 'How do you dare to question when I command? Worthless creature, toad! If you do not go this minute to the woods and get me violets I will kill you,' threatened Holena. The stepmother seized Marushka, pushed her out of the house, and closed the door. The girl went to the forest, weeping bitterly. Deep snow was on the ground; there was no trace of a path. Long she wandered. She was hungry and cold, and prayed to God to take her out of the world. At last, off in the distance, she saw a bright light. She went toward it and ascending a hill she came to a fire; around the fire on twelve stones, sat twelve men; three old men with long white beards, three somewhat younger, three in years of manhood, and three beautiful youths. They were sitting in silence and looking calmly on the fire. They were the Twelve Months. December sat in the first place; his hair and beard were white as snow; he held a scepter in his hand. Marushka stood in astonishment, but after a time, summoning courage, she drew near, and asked, 'Kind men, will you let me warm myself at the fire? I am shivering with cold.' December nodded his head. When the maid was warm, he asked, 'Why are you here?' 'I am looking for violets,' answered Marushka. 'But there are no violets in winter; everything is covered with snow.' 'I know that,' answered Marushka, sadly; 'but my mother and sister have sent me for violets; if I do not get them they will kill me. Tell me, good shepherds, is there any place where I can find violets?' December rose from his seat, went to the youngest month, and said, 'Brother March, sit in the first place.' March took the highest place and waved the scepter above the fire; that instant the fire burned more powerfully. The snow thawed; birds appeared on the branches and grass grew green, beneath the trees; flowers began to open. Spring had come. In the thickets violets were blooming; there were so many that they were like a blue carpet. 'Quick, Marushka, pluck them!' said March. Marushka gathered a great bouquet, thanked the Twelve Months, and hurried home. Holena and her mother were astonished when they saw Marushka coming with a large bunch of violets in her hand. They opened the door; she entered and the whole house was filled with the perfume. 'Where did you find them?' asked Holena. 'On a hill; there are many of them under the trees.' Holena took the violets, put them in her belt and enjoyed their perfume; she didn't offer even one of them to Marushka. The next day they sent Marushka for strawberries. Long she wandered around in the cold, praying God to take her out of the world; then she came to the Twelve Months and again met with a kind reception. Learning what she wanted, December left his place and going to the month sitting just opposite, gave him the scepter, and said, 'Brother June, sit in the first place.' June sat in the highest place and waved the scepter above the fire; that instant the flames leaped high, the snow melted, the earth was covered with grass, the trees with leaves; the birds began to sing; many-colored flowers bloomed in the forest. Summer had come. Little white blossoms gleamed, like stars, in the grass, as if some one had put them there on purpose. Before Marushka's eyes the flowers became fruit, and the berries were ripe. She could not look around before the grass was dotted with them as if some one had sprinkled it with blood-drops. Marushka gathered many berries and took them to her sister. Helena ate some of them and gave her mother some, but did not offer even one to Marushka. The next day Holena wanted apples, and she sent Marushka for them. The unfortunate girl waded through deep snow and wandered around in the cold praying God to take her out of the world. At last she found the Twelve Months sitting in front of their fire as formerly. When she told them what she had been sent for, December gave the scepter to his brother September, who sat in the first place and waved the scepter over the fire. The fire burned brighter and the snow vanished, but Nature had a solemn face; leaves were falling from the trees, a fresh wind drove them hither and thither over the dry and yellow grass. Marushka saw no flowers, but she saw an apple tree loaded with red fruit. 'Shake the tree quickly,' said September. She shook it; one blushing apple fell. She shook it again; another fell. 'Now hurry home,' said September. She obeyed, and carried home the two apples. Holena wondered at their beauty and so did her mother. 'Where did you get them?' 'On a hill; there are many there yet.' 'Why didn't you bring more?' asked Holena, angrily. 'No doubt you ate them on the road.' 'I did not. I shook the tree once: one apple fell; I shook it again: another fell. They wouldn't let me shake it again; they told me to go home.' 'May lightning strike you!' screamed Holena, and she wanted to beat her sister. The poor girl began to cry. Holena ate an apple; it seemed to her wonderfully sweet. She finished, and said to her mother, 'Give me my cloak, I'll go into the forest myself. If that good-for-nothing girl goes she will be sure to eat the apples. I'll shake off every apple whether they permit me to or not; it's all the same to me,' She put on her cloak, tied a shawl over her head and went out. The snow was deep; there was no trace of a human foot anywhere. She wandered long, and at last she came to the Twelve Months. Without asking leave Holena walked straight to the fire and began to warm her hands. 'What do you want; why are you here?' asked December, severely. 'Why ask, old man? What business is it of yours where I am going?' answered Holena, and turned to go into the forest. December frowned and raised his scepter. That moment the fire died down, the heavens grew dark; snow fell in great flakes, as if someone were shaking feathers out of a tick; and a cutting, all-chilling wind whistled through the forest. Holena could not see one step before her; she felt that her limbs were growing stiff. She cursed Marushka, and stumbled on. The mother, waiting at home, looked through the window, and ran to the gate; but hours passed by, one after another, and no Holena came. 'Most likely she found the apples so good that she can't stop eating them. I'll go myself and look for her,' said the mother. She put on her cloak, threw a shawl over her head and went in search of her daughter. Time passed. Marushka got supper ready, and fed the cow, but neither Holena nor her mother came. 'Where are they stopping so long?' thought Marushka, and she sat down to spin. The spinning was finished, then night came, but still they were not at home. 'Lord be merciful to us! What has happened to them?' said the kind-hearted girl. She looked out. The heavens were gleaming with stars, the earth glittering with snow, but no human being was visible anywhere. She closed the door, made the sign of the cross, repeated 'Our Father' for her stepmother and sister, and then lay down to sleep. The next day she looked for them at breakfast, waited for them at dinner; but in vain. They came not again to the house of living man.", "title": "The Twelve Months", "id": 595}

{"label": "425C", "text": "Scarlet thread, spun on the wheel, Twisting on the twirling reel, Like the dancers turn and spin, While I now my tale begin! Once upon a time there was a merchant, and he traded 'all the way to Bagdad,' as the saying is. He had twelve ships which sailed to foreign countries, and he had besides three pretty daughters. Well, as time went on, luck turned against the merchant. His wife died; one by one he lost his ships; and every year he became poorer and poorer. At last he had lost all his property with the exception of one farm, and he went to live there with his daughters. As they had now no money to hire laborers, the merchant told the girls that they must set to and work on the farm in order that they might gain a living. 'We cannot do farm work,' replied the two eldest, tossing their heads. 'We are not accustomed to it.' But the youngest, whose name was Rosa, loved her father very dearly; and she at once prepared to do as he wished. So she set to with a will, and digged in the garden, and raked, and planted; and when the fruits and vegetables were grown, she rose early in the morning to gather them for her father to carry to market. Time passed, and after many months tidings came to the merchant that three of his belated ships had come into port laden with costly goods, when he immediately prepared to go to the city. But before mounting his horse, he asked his daughters what each desired as a present. The two eldest begged for fine silken gowns; but when he asked the youngest, she said, 'I want nothing, papa mine, now that I see you released from your poverty.' And when her father pressed her, she said, 'Well, then, papa mine, bring me a rose, a beautiful, sweet-smelling damask rose.' So the merchant set off for the port, and landed his goods. In twelve days' time he had sold them all save the two silken gowns which he had kept for his daughters; but he had found no rose for the youngest. As he was riding home to his farm, it began to rain so heavily that when they came to the open gateway of a house by the wayside, his horse trotted through it into the courtyard. There was no one about, so he put the horse in the stable, and went up to the house. The door stood wide open, so he walked in and sate himself down on a seat in the hall. At once he found by his side coffee and sweetmeats, and a long pipe filled with fragrant tobacco, without his seeing who had brought them. Presently the rain ceased, and the merchant arose and went from chamber to chamber to seek the host and thank him for the shelter and entertainment. Finding no one, however, he was going forth to take his beast from the stable and continue his journey, when, as he crossed the courtyard, he caught sight of a bush of damask roses which had three blossoms on one stem. No sooner, however, had he stretched out his hand and plucked them than there appeared at his feet a snake, who said, 'Ah, thankless man! After I have opened my doors to save thee from the storm, canst not see a rose or two without desiring and plucking them?' 'I sought through the chambers to find the host and say a 'Thank you' to him, but found him not,' the merchant replied. 'Listen to me,' then said the snake. 'Thou hast three daughters, and thou must bring me the youngest. Think not to thyself that I am only a snake, and cannot come and find thee if thou dost not my bidding.' The poor man asked how many days' grace he would give him; and he granted him forty days. At last he got home to his house; his daughters gathered round him; and when the two eldest had got their gowns he gave the roses to the youngest, and then sat down weeping. 'What is the matter, papa mine, that you weep?' she asked, anxiously. Then, as the merchant related his adventure, Rosa's sisters began to reproach her, and point their fingers at her, saying, 'Wretched girl that thou art! A gown was not good enough for thee, but thou must have a damask rose, forsooth, that the snake might come and destroy us!' When her father had also told them of the forty days' grace, Rosa went to her chamber and wrote down the date; and she did not seem at all troubled, though her sisters were continually reproaching her. On the thirty-eighth day she went to her father and said, 'Papa mine, saddle now the horse so that we may go where I am invited.' 'Can I take thee, my darling child, to the snake who will destroy thee?' cried the unhappy man. 'The snake will not destroy me, if I do his bidding,' replied Rosa. 'What ill-will can he have against me? Arise, and let us be gone.' She bade farewell to her sisters; she and her father set out on their journey, and on the fortieth day they arrived at the snake's abode. The gate was open, as before, and when the merchant had stabled his horse he led his daughter into the house, and they sate them down. Soon came coffee and sweets, as before, without anyone being seen; and in a little while the snake appeared and said to the merchant, 'So thou hast done my bidding and brought thy daughter?' 'Yea, I have brought her, as I promised,' he replied; and when he had kissed and embraced his daughter, he mounted his horse and rode home again. But in a few days he fell ill with grief and took to his bed. So the poor girl was left alone with the snake. And it became the snake's custom, every day when she was taking her coffee after dinner, to climb into her lap and ask her, 'Wilt thou take me for thy husband?' And she would reply, 'But I am afraid of thee.' And she was very sad and lonely because her father did not come to see her as he had promised. Well, one day, as she was sitting at the table, it suddenly opened before her and disclosed a mirror in which all the world was reflected; and, when she saw in it her father lying ill in bed, she began to weep and tear her hair. The snake, who was in the garden, hearing her cries and her breast-beatings, hurried to her and asked, 'What ails thee, my Rose?' 'See in the mirror,' she cried, 'how my father lies nigh unto death!' Then said the snake, 'Open the table drawer and thou wilt find a ring. Put it on thy finger, and tell me how many days thou wilt be absent?' 'I will come back,' she replied, 'as soon as my father recovers.' 'Well, I will give thee thirty-one days' leave. If thou come one day later, thou wilt find me dead on some mound in the garden.' 'Do thyself no harm,' said the girl. 'When my leave has expired I will return to thee.' The snake ordered supper to be served, and when she had eaten, he said, 'Put the ring on thy tongue, and thou wilt find thyself at home in thy chamber.' Rosa lay down, put the ring on her tongue, and closed her eyes. Her father's servants, passing the door of her chamber, heard her breathing, and ran to tell their young mistresses, who hastened in and found her asleep on her bed. The maiden awoke, and when she found that she was indeed at home again she praised God. Her father was rejoiced to see his Rosa again, and asked her many questions about her life with the snake. When she told him what the snake had said to her every day at dinner time, and that she had replied, 'But I am afraid of thee,' he said to her, 'My daughter dear, the next time he asks thee that question, do thou answer, 'Yea, I will take thee!' and we shall see what will hap.' And she promised to say this. Her sisters, however, tried to persuade her not to go back, so that the snake might die and they would be rid of him. But Rosa was indignant, and replied, 'How could I leave my beast to die, who have received such help from him?' So she remained with her father, whose joy she was, for as many days as she had leave. Then, bidding him and her sisters farewell, she lay down on her bed, put the ring in her mouth, and went back to the snake. When he saw her, he said, 'Ah, thou hast come back to me, my Rose!' And after dinner, when coffee was served, and he lay in her lap as before and asked, 'Wilt thou take me for thy husband?' she replied, 'Yea, I will take thee!' When she had said these words the snake's skin fell off him, and he became a handsome prince. And the table again opened and all the world was seen therein. Then Rosa asked him what manner of man he was, and how he had become a snake. And he told her how that he had fallen under the spell of an enchantress who had changed him into a snake, and had doomed him to retain that shape until he should find a maiden who would consent to marry him. 'But now,' he said, 'I will return to my kingdom. Thy father and sisters shall be conveyed thither, and then we will hold our wedding.' So they were married, and the prince made his father-in-law his grand vizier. And we will leave them well, and return and find them better -- God be praised!", "title": "The Snake-Prince", "id": 599}
{"label": "124", "text": "Brer Rabbit could never get any peace. He couldn't leave home without Brer Wolf making a raid and toting off some of the family. Brer Rabbit built himself a straw house, and it was torn down. Then a made a house out of pine tops, and that went the same way. Then he made himself a bark house, and it was raided. And every time he lost a house, he lost one of his children. At last Brer Rabbit got mad, he did, and cussed, and then he went off, he did, and got some carpenters, and they built him a plank house with a rock foundation. After that he could have some peace and quiet. He could go out and pass the time of day with his neighbors, and come back and sit by the fire and smoke his pipe and read the newspapers the same as any man who has a family. He made a hole, he did, in the cellar where the little rabbits could hide out when there was much of a racket in the neighborhood, and the latch of the front door caught on the inside. Brer Wolf, he saw the lay of the land, he did, and he laid low. The little rabbits were mighty skittish, but it got so that cold chills didn't run up Brer Rabbit's back any more when he heard Brer Wolf go galloping by. By and by, one day when Brer Rabbit was fixing to call on Miss Coon, he heard a monstrous fuss and clatter up the big road, and almost before he could fix his ears to listen, Brer Wolf ran in the door. The little rabbits, they went into the hole in the cellar, they did, like blowing out a candle. Brer Wolf was fairly covered with mud, and mighty well nigh out of wind. 'Oh, do pray save me, Brer Rabbit!' said Brer Wolf. 'Do please, Brer Rabbit! The dogs are after me, and they'll tear me up. Don't you hear them coming? O, do please save me, Brer Rabbit! Hide me somewhere the dogs won't get me.' No quicker said than done. 'Jump in that chest there, Brer Wolf,' said Brer Rabbit. 'Jump in there and make yourself at home.' In jumped Brer Wolf, down came the lid, and into the hasp went the hook, and there Mr. Wolf was. Then Brer Rabbit went to the looking-glass, he did, and winked at himself. And then he pulled the rocking chair in front of the fire, he did, and took a big chew of tobacco. Then Brer Rabbit sat there a long time, he did, turning his mind over and working his thinking machine. By and by he got up and sort of stirred around. Then Brer Wolf opened up, 'Are the dogs all gone, Brer Rabbit?' 'It seems like I hear one of them smelling around the chimney corner just now.' Then Brer Rabbit got the kettle and filled it full of water and put it on the fire. 'What are you doing now, Brer Rabbit?' 'I'm fixing to make you a nice cup of tea, Brer Wolf.' Then Brer Rabbit went to the cupboard and got the gimlet, and commenced to bore little holes in the chest lid. 'What are you doing now, Brer Rabbit?' 'I'm boring little holes so you can breathe, Brer Wolf.' Then Brer Rabbit went out and got some more wood, and flung it on the fire. 'What are you doing now, Brer Rabbit?' 'I'm chunking up the fire so you won't get cold, Brer Wolf.' Then Brer Rabbit went down into the cellar and fetched out all his children. 'What are you doing now, Brer Rabbit?' 'I'm telling my children what a nice man you are, Brer Wolf.' And the children, they had to put their hands on their mouth to keep from laughing. Then Brer Rabbit, he got the kettle and commenced to pour the hot water onto the chest lid. 'What's that I hear, Brer Rabbit?' 'You hear the wind a-blowing, Brer Wolf.' Then the water began to sift through. 'What's that I feel, Brer Rabbit?' 'You feel the fleas a-biting, Brer Wolf.' 'They are biting might hard, Brer Rabbit.' 'Turn over on the other side, Brer Wolf.' 'What's that I feel now, Brer Rabbit?' 'You still feel the fleas, Brer Wolf.' 'They are eating me up, Brer Rabbit.' And those were the last words of Brer Wolf, because the scalding water did the business. Then Brer Rabbit called in his neighbors, he did, and they held a regular jubilee. And if you go to Brer Rabbit's house right now, I don't know but what you'll find Brer Wolf's hide hanging in the back porch, and all because he was so busy with other folks's doings.", "title": "The Awful Fate of Mr. Wolf", "id": 600}
{"label": "311", "text": "Like many others in the world, there was a cobbler who had three daughters. They were very poor. He only earned enough just to feed his children. He did not know what would become of him. He went about in his grief, walking, walking sadly on, and he meets a gentleman, who asks him where he is going, melancholy like that. He answers him, 'Even if I shall tell you, I shall get no relief.' 'Yes, yes; who knows? Tell it.' 'I have three daughters, and I have not work enough to maintain them. I have famine in the house.' 'If it is only that, we will manage it. You will give me one of your daughters, and I will give you so much money.' The father was, very grieved to make any such bargain; but at last he comes down to that. He gives him his eldest daughter. This gentleman takes her to his palace, and, after having passed some time there, he said to her that he has a short journey to make -- that he will leave her all the keys, that she might see everything, but that there is one key that she must not make use of -- that it would bring misfortune on her. He locks the door on the young lady. This young girl goes into all the rooms, and finds them very beautiful, and she was curious to see what there was in that which was forbidden. She goes in, and sees heaps of dead bodies. Judge of her fright! With her trembling she lets the key fall upon the ground. She trembles for the coming of her husband. He arrives, and asks her if she has entered the forbidden chamber. She tells him 'Yes.' He takes her and puts her into an underground dungeon; hardly, hardly did he give her enough to eat (to live on), and that was human flesh. This cobbler had finished his money, and he was again melancholy. The gentleman meets him again, and says to him, 'Your other daughter is not happy alone; you must give me another daughter. When she is happy, I will send her back; and I will give you so much money.' The father did not like it; but he was so poor that, in order to have a little money, he gives him his daughter. The gentleman takes her home with him, like the other. After some days he said to her too, 'I must take a short journey. I will give you all the keys of the house, but do not touch such a key of such a room.' He locks the house door, and goes off, after having left her the food she needed. This young girl goes into all the rooms, and, as she was curious, she went to look into the forbidden chamber. She was so terribly frightened at the sight of so many dead bodies in this room, that she lets the key fall, and it gets stained. Our young girl was trembling as to what should become of her when the master should come back. He arrives, and the first thing he asks, 'Have you been in that room?' She told him 'Yes.' He takes her underground, like her other sister. This cobbler had finished his money, and he was in misery; when the gentleman comes to him again, and says to him, 'I will give you a great deal of money if you will let your daughter come to my house for a few days; the three will be happier together, and I will send you the two back again together.' The father believes it, and gives him his third daughter. The gentleman gives him the money, and he takes this young girl, like the others. At the end of some days he leaves her, saying that he is going to make a short journey. He gives her all the keys of the house, saying to her, 'You will go into all the rooms except this one,' pointing out the key to her. He locks the outside door, and goes off. This young girl goes straight, straight to the forbidden chamber; she opens it, and think of her horror at seeing so many dead people. She thought that he would kill her too, and, as there were all kinds of arms in this chamber, she takes a sabre with her, and hides it under her dress. She goes a little further on, and sees her two sisters almost dying with hunger, and a young man in the same condition. She takes care of them as well as she can till the gentleman comes home. On his arrival, he asks her, 'Have you been in that room?' She says, 'Yes;' and, in giving him back the keys, she lets them fall on the ground, on purpose, and at the instant that this gentleman stoops to pick them up, the young lady cuts off his head (with her sword). Oh, how glad she was! Quickly she runs to deliver her sisters and that young man, who was the son of a king. She sends for her father, the cobbler, and leaves him there with his two daughters, and the youngest daughter goes away with her young gentleman, after being married to him.

He'd travelled o'er the wide, wide world. Amid its heat and cold, But he had never, never seen A man one-half so old. His face was wrinkled like a skin That's shrivell'd by the heat; His hair was whiter than the snow We tread beneath our feet. It made the pilgrim very sad. As he was passing by, To see his old eyes fill'd with tears. To hear him sob and cry. The man was crying like a child, His tears fell like the rain; The pilgrim felt for him, and ask'd, 'Old man, are you in pain? 'Oh, tell me, tell me, poor old man, Why do you sob and cry?' The old man rubb'd his eyes, and said, 'Feethur's bin a byutting I!' 'Old man, old man, you must be mad. For that can never be; Your father surely has been dead At least a century.' 'My feethur be alive and well, I wish that he weer dy'ud. For he ha bin and byut his stick About my face and yud.' The pilgrim pick'd the old man up.

{"label": "510B", "text": "But this she said because the shoe was under a spell, and would fit no one whom he could marry. The king, however, caused the shoe to be tried on all manner of women; and when the answer always was that it would fit none of them, he grew quite bewildered and strange in his mind. After some years had passed, his young daughter, having grown up to girl's estate, came to him one day, saying, 'Oh, papa; only think! Mamma's shoe just fits me!' 'Does it!' replied the simple king; 'then I must marry you.' 'Oh, that cannot be, papa,' said the girl, and ran away. But the simple king was so possessed with the idea that he must marry the woman whom his wife's shoe fitted, that he sent for her every day and said the same thing. But the queen had not said that he should marry the woman whom her shoe fitted, but that he should not marry any whom it did not fit. When the princess found that he persevered in his silly caprice, she said at last, 'Papa, if I am to do what you say, you must do some thing for me first.' 'Agreed, my child,' replied the king; 'you have only to speak.' 'Then, before I marry,' said the girl, 'I want a lot of things, but I will begin with one at a time. First, I want a dress of the color of a beautiful noontide sky, but all covered with stars like the sky at midnight, and furnished with a parure to suit it.' Such a dress the king had made and brought to her. 'Next,' said the princess, 'I want a dress of the color of the sea, all covered with golden fishes, with a fitting parure.' Such a dress the king had made, and brought to her. 'Next,' said the princess, 'I want a dress of a dark blue, all covered with gold embroidery and spangled with silver bells, and with a parure to match.' Such a dress the king had made and brought to her. 'These are all very good,' said the princess; 'but now you must send for the most cunning artificer in your whole kingdom, and let him make me a figure of an old woman just like life, fitted with all sorts of springs to make it move and walk when one gets inside it, just like a real woman.' Such a figure the king had made, and brought it to the princess. 'That is just the sort of figure I wanted,' said she;' and now I don't want anything more.' And the simple king went away quite happy. As soon as she was alone, however, the princess packed all the three dresses and many of her other dresses, and all her jewelry and a large sum of money, inside the figure of the old woman, and then she got into it and walked away. No one seeing an old woman walking out of the palace thought she had anything to do with the princess, and thus she got far away without anyone thinking of stopping her. On, on, on, she wandered till she came to the palace of a great king, and just at the time that the king's son was coming in from hunting. 'Have you a place in all this fine palace to take in a poor old body?' whined the princess inside the figure of the old woman. 'No, no! get out of the way! How dare you come in the way of the prince!' said the servants, and drove her away. But the prince took compassion on her, and called her to him. 'What's your name, good woman?' said the prince. 'Maria Wood is my name, your Highness,' replied the princess. 'And what can you do, since you ask for a place?' 'Oh, I can do many things. First, I understand all about poultry, and then --' 'That'll do,' replied the prince; 'take her, and let her be the hen-wife, and let her have food and lodging, and all she wants.' So they gave her a little hut on the borders of the forest, and set her to tend the poultry. But the prince as he went out hunting often passed by her hut, and when she saw him pass she never failed to come out and salute him, and now and then he would stop his horse and spend a few moments in gossip with her. Before long it was Carnival time; and as the prince came by Maria Wood came out and wished him a 'good Carnival.' The prince stopped his horse and said, his young head full of the pleasure he expected, 'Tomorrow, you know, we have the first day of the feast.' 'To be sure I know it; and how I should like to be there; won't you take me?' answered Maria Wood. 'You shameless old woman,' replied the prince, 'to think of your wanting to go to a festino at your time of life!' and he gave her a cut with his whip. The next day Maria put on her dress of the color of the noontide sky, covered with stars like the sky at midnight, with the parure made to wear with it, and came to the feast. Every lady made place before her dazzling appearance, and the prince alone dared to ask her to dance. With her he danced all the evening, and fairly fell in love with her, nor could he leave her side; and as they sat together, he took the ring off his own finger and put it on to her hand. She appeared equally satisfied with his attentions, and seemed to desire no other partner. Only when he tried to gather from her whence she was, she would only say she came from the country of Whipblow, which set the prince wondering very much, as he had never heard of such a country. At the end of the ball, the prince sent his attendants to watch her that he might learn where she lived, but she disappeared so swiftly it was impossible for them to tell what had become of her. When the prince came by Maria Wood's hut next day, she did not fail to wish him again a 'good Carnival.' 'Tomorrow we have the second festino, you know,' said the prince. 'Well I know it,' replied Maria Wood; 'shouldn't I like to go! Won't you take me?' 'You contemptible old woman to talk in that way!' exclaimed the prince. 'You ought to know better!' and he struck her with his boot. Next night Maria put on her dress of the color of the sea, covered all over with gold fishes, and the parure made to wear with it, and went to the feast. The prince recognized her at once, and claimed her for his partner all the evening, nor did she seem to wish for any other, only when he tried to learn from her whence she was, she would only say she came from the country of Bootkick. The prince could not remember ever to have heard of the Bootkick country, and thought she meant to laugh at him; however, he ordered his attendants to make more haste this night in following her; but what diligence so ever they used she was too swift for them. The next time the prince came by Maria Wood's hut, she did not fail to wish him again a 'good Carnival.' 'Tomorrow we have the last festino!' exclaimed he, with a touch of sadness, for he remembered it was the last of the happy evenings that he could feel sure of seeing his fair unknown. 'Ah! you must take me. But, what'll you say if I come to it in spite of you?' answered Maria Wood. 'You incorrigible old woman!' exclaimed the prince; 'you provoke me so with your nonsense, I really cannot keep my hand off you;' and he gave her a slap. The next night Maria Wood put on her dress of a dark blue, all covered with gold embroidery and spangled with silver bells, and the parure made to wear with it. The prince constituted her his partner for the evening as before, nor did she seem to wish for any other, only when he wanted to learn from her whence she was, all she would say was that she came from Slapland. This night the prince told his servants to make more haste in following her, or he would discharge them all. But they answered, 'It is useless to attempt the thing, as no mortal can equal her in swiftness.' After this, the prince fell ill of his disappointment, because he saw no hope of hearing any more of the fair domino with whom he had spent three happy evenings, nor could any doctor find any remedy for his sickness. Then Maria Wood sent him word, saying, 'Though the prince's physicians cannot help him, yet let him but take a cup of broth of my making, and he will immediately be healed.' 'Nonsense! how can a cup of broth, or how can any medicament, help me!' exclaimed the prince. 'There is no cure for my ailment.' Again Maria Wood sent the same message; but the prince said angrily, 'Tell the silly old thing to hold her tongue; she doesn't know what she's talking about.' But again, the third time, Maria Wood sent to him, saying, 'Let the prince but take a cup of broth of my making, and he will immediately be healed.' By this time the prince was so weary that he did not take the trouble to refuse. The servants finding him so depressed began to fear that he was sinking, and they called to Maria Wood to make her broth, because, though they had little faith in her promise, they knew not what else to try. So Maria Wood made ready the cup of broth she had promised, and they put it down beside the prince. Presently the whole palace was roused; the prince had started up in bed, and was shouting, 'Bring hither Maria Wood! Quick! Bring hither Maria Wood!' So they ran and fetched Maria Wood, wondering what could have happened to bring about so great a change in the prince. But the truth was, that Maria had put into the cup of broth the ring the prince had put on her finger the first night of the feast, and when he began to take the broth he found the ring with the spoon. When he saw the ring, he knew at once that Maria Wood could tell where to find his fair partner. 'Wait a bit! There's plenty of time!' said Maria, when the servant came to fetch her in all haste; and she waited to put on her dress of the color of the noontide sky. The prince was beside himself for joy when he saw her, and would have the betrothal celebrated that very day.", "title": "Maria Wood (Busk)", "id": 603}
{"label": "1540", "text": "The following story will show how foolish a wife of one of these gamaralas was on one occasion. I heard the story related by an old woman, one of a class frequenting the houses of rich natives for gossip and a free meal. In order to render the story intelligible, it is necessary that I should explain the phrase which heads this paper. It is a common phrase among the Sinhalese, and is well understood by them. It literally means that one has gone to that world and returned to this world. 'Elova,' 'that world,' means the next world, or the place whither the dead go; and 'melova,' 'this world,' signi?es the earth, where mankind dwell. The phrase is used in reference to one who, having been at the point of death, recovered unexpectedly. It appears, however, that there are some extremely ignorant people, who understand the phrase literally, and think that the person in reference to whom it is used has actually gone to a world which is beyond the grave, and has come back to this world. After this explanation, I shall proceed to narrate the story: There was once a gamarala in whose absence a beggar, who was very lean, weak, and worn-out by sickness, came to his house. The gamarala's wife wondered how he could be so dis?gured, and said to him, 'Dear me! What has happened to you?' The man replied, 'Mama noboda elova gohin melova ava vada.' -- 'Having lately gone to the other world I have come to this world,' or in plain language, 'I almost died and recovered.' The woman understood the words literally, and thought within herself that the man went lately to the land of the departed souls, and then returned to this world. She was wonderstruck, and she listened to him with very great attention, with her mouth wide open and her eyes intently ?xed upon him. She then very tenderly addressed him and said to him, 'As you have come from the other world, you must have seen our daughter Kaluhami, who died and went to elova a few days ago. Pray tell me how she is.' The man at once understood the woman's mistake and shrewdly answered, 'Madam! She is my wife, and lives with me at present, and she has sent me to you for her geranam malla.' This is a bag in which young women in those times kept all that they considered valuable of their private property. The woman, believing the beggar to be her son-in-law, asked him very kindly to sit down and wait a few minutes, as the gamarala was expected to return by that time; but the man said that he could not prolong his stay as his wife, Kaluhami, would be impatiently waiting for his return. So saying, he requested her to give him the geranam malla. The woman placed before her supposed son-in-law a sumptuous breakfast, which he ?nished hastily, saying that he was anxious to get away without any loss of time. The woman then delivered to him the geranam malla, together with all the jewelry and such other articles that had been intended as presents to Kaluhami on her wedding day. The beggar, leaving the house with the valuables, was returning to his village as fast as he could, knowing that on the gamarala's return the woman would tell him all that had transpired at his house in his absence, and that he would then be irritated and would follow him for the purpose of arresting him and getting back the property. It was not long before his worst fears were realized. He saw the gamarala riding furiously after him calling out, 'Stop you rogue! Stop scoundrel!' The cunning beggar ran up at once to a large tree that stood by the road-side and climbed it. The gamarala rode up to the spot and dismounting from the horse tied it to the tree and climbed it with great dif?culty, whereupon the beggar hastily descended to the ground by means of a branch extending towards the opposite direction, and untying the horse and mounting on it galloped away as fast as he could. The gamarala then came down from the tree, and, seeing the man at such a distance that it was quite beyond his power to overtake him, called out to him and said, 'My son-in-law, tell our daughter that the geranam malla and jewels are from her mother, and that the horse is from me.'

{"label": "777", "text": "That wooden ghost, that spook-ship, is so called from the captain, a Dutchman, who once swore by all the devils that he would get round a certain mountain -- its name has escaped me -- in spite of a fearful storm, even if he would have to sail until Judgment Day. The devil took him at his word, therefore he must sail forever, until set free by a woman's loyalty. The devil, in his stupidity, has no faith in female loyalty, and allowed the enchanted captain to land once in seven years and get married, and thus find opportunities to save his soul. The poor Dutchman! He often has been only too glad to escape from his marriage and his wife-savior, and get on board again. The play which I saw in Amsterdam [in the year 1827] was based on this fable. Another seven years have passed; the poor Dutchman is more weary than ever of his endless wandering; he comes ashore, befriends a Scottish nobleman, to whom he sells diamonds at an unbelievably low price, and when he hears that his customer has a beautiful daughter, he asks for her hand in marriage. This bargain is agreed to as well. Next we see the Scotsman's home; with an anxious heart the maiden awaits the bridegroom. With melancholy she often looks up at a large, time-worn picture which hangs in the hall, and depicts a handsome man in Spanish-Dutch clothing. It is an old heirloom, and according to her grandmother, it is a true portrait of the Flying Dutchman as he was seen in Scotland a hundred years earlier, in the time of William of Orange. A warning connected to this portrait has been passed down as well: that the women of the family must beware of the person depicted in the painting. This warning has naturally enough had the result of deeply impressing the features of the dangerous man in the picture in the girl's mind, from her childhood onward. Therefore, when the authentic Flying Dutchman makes his appearance, she is startled, but not from fear. He too is moved when he sees the portrait. But when he is told who it represents, he tactfully turns aside all suspicion, makes fun of the superstition, and ridicules the Flying Dutchman, the Wandering Jew of the Ocean. Nevertheless, now in a melancholy mood, he relates how the gentleman must be suffering horribly out there on the endless waves, how his body is nothing other than a coffin of flesh in which is soul in imprisoned, how life and death alike reject him, like an empty cask scornfully cast ashore by the sea, then contemptuously again set adrift. He further muses that the poor Dutchman's agony must be as deep as the sea on which he sails -- cast between life and death, his ship without anchor, and his heart without hope. I believe that these were, more or less, the words with which the bridegroom ends. The bride looks at him earnestly, now and then casting glances at his portrait. It seems seems that she has guessed his secret; and when he afterwards asks, 'Katherine, will you be true to me?' she answers with resolve, 'True to death.' She cries aloud, 'I was true to you to this hour, and I know how to be true unto death! Saying this she throws herself into the waves, and the enchantment is ended. The Flying Dutchman is redeemed, and we see the ghostly ship slowly sink into the depths of the sea.", "title": "The Fable of the Flying Dutchman", "id": 605}
{"label": "510B", "text": "'How can you take me for a wife,' said the girl, 'for I am your daughter.' 'That is all the same to me. I want to marry you.' 'That is entirely impossible!' said the girl. 'Just go to the bishop and listen to what he says. If he says that you are right, then take me in God's name.' So the king went to the bishop and asked, 'If someone has a lamb that he himself has cared for and raised, is it better that he should eat it, or that another person should eat it?' 'No,' answered the bishop, 'it is better for the person to eat it who raised it.' Then the king went back to his daughter and said, 'He told me that I may take you.' 'If he really told you that you make take me, then take me in God's name. But first make me two dresses of pure gold, and fill the pockets with ducats. Also make a bed for me, and a shaft that goes ten fathoms deep into the earth.' When the king had done all this, the girl took the dresses, climbed into the bed, then rode in into the shaft, saying, 'Earth, open further.' And the earth opened further, and she rode one until she came out at another place, and there she remained. A prince was hunting there, and he found the girl, wrapped in an animal skin. He approached her and asked, 'Are you a human?' She answered, 'Yes, I am a human. May I go with you?' He replied, 'For all I care you may come with me.' He took her with him and let her herd the geese. One day the king gave a feast, and the women began to dance. Then the girl slipped out of her animal skin and went to the ball in her golden dress, and danced. The prince saw her and said to himself,' Who can that be? When she leaves the ball, I will follow her.' When the ball was over the girl left, and the prince crept after her. She noticed him, and she began to run, and he ran after her. Then the girl took a handful of ducats and threw them to the ground. While the prince was gathering up the gold she slipped away and hid herself in her animal skin. Then the prince said, 'Tomorrow I will give another feast, in order to see who she is.' The next day at the ball the girl came again and danced, and when she left the ball the prince ran after her. While running away she lost a shoe, and while the prince was picking it up she escaped half barefoot, then hid herself again in her animal skin. The prince took the shoe and tried it onto all the girls in order to see whom it fitted, but he could not find the right one. When the servant girls were taking wash water to the king before he ate, the girl split her animal skin a little at her knee so that her gold dress was visible. Then she went to the servant girls and said that she would like to take the water to the king. But they said, 'What? You, a goose girl want to take water to the king?' 'What is the matter?' asked the king. 'The goose girl want to bring your water.' 'Then let her do so. Just let her come.' When she knelt down the golden dress shone through the slit. The prince saw this and cried out, 'So you are the one who tormented me so!' And with that he took her as his wife.", "title": "All-Kinds-of-Fur (Hahn)", "id": 606}
{"label": "280A", "text": "One of the ants asked him how he had disposed of his time in summer, that he had not taken pains and laid in a stock, as they had done. 'Alas! my friends,' says he, 'I passed away the time merrily and pleasantly, in drinking, singing, and dancing, and never once thought of winter. 'If that be the case,' replied the ant, 'all I have to say is this: that they who drink, sing, and dance in the summer, run a great risk of starving in the winter.' Application: As summer is the season in which the industrious laborious husbandman lays up his supplies for the winter, so youth and manhood are the times of life which we should employ in laying in such a stock as may suffice for helpless old age; yet there are many whom we call rational creatures, who squander away in a profuse prodigality, whatever they get in their younger days, as if the infirmity of age would require no supplies to support it, or at least would find them administered to it in some miraculous way. From this fable we learn this admirable lesson, never to lose the present opportunity of fairly and honestly providing against the future evils and accidents of life; and while health and the vigour of our faculties remain firm and entire, to lay them out to the best advantage; so that when age and infirmities despoil us of our strength and abilities, we may not have to bewail that we have neglected to provide for the wants of our latter days: for it should always be remembered, that 'a youth of revels breeds an age of care,' and that temperance in youth lays the foundation of health and comfort for old age.", "title": "The Ant and the Grasshopper (Bewick)", "id": 607}
{"label": "451", "text": "A man had seven sons, but however much he wished for a daughter, he did not have one yet. Finally his wife gave him hope for another child, and when it came into the world it was indeed a girl. Great was their joy, but the child was sickly and small, and because of her weakness, she was to be given an emergency baptism. The father sent one of the boys to run quickly to the well and get some water for the baptism. The other six ran along with him. Because each one of them wanted to be first one to dip out the water, the jug fell into the well. There they stood not knowing what to do, and not one of them dared to go home. When they did not return the father grew impatient, and said, 'They have forgotten what they went after because they were playing, those godless boys.' Fearing that the girl would die without being baptized, he cried out in anger, 'I wish that those boys would all turn into ravens.' He had hardly spoken these words when he heard a whirring sound above his head, and looking up, he saw seven coal-black ravens flying up and away. The parents could not take back the curse, and however sad they were at the loss of their seven sons, they were still somewhat comforted because of their dear little daughter, who soon gained strength and became more beautiful every day. For a long time she did not know that she had had brothers, for her parents took care not to mention them to her. However, one day she accidentally overheard some people talking about her. They said that she was beautiful enough, but that in truth she was to blame for her seven brothers' misfortune. This troubled her greatly, and she went to her father and mother and asked them if she indeed had had brothers, and what had happened to them. Her parents could no longer keep the secret, but said that it had been heaven's fate, and that her birth had been only the innocent cause. However, this ate at the girl's conscience every day, and she came to believe that she would have to redeem her brothers. She had neither rest nor peace until she secretly set forth and went out into the wide world, hoping to find her brothers and to set them free, whatever it might cost. She took nothing with her but a little ring as a remembrance from her parents, a loaf of bread for hunger, a little jug of water for thirst, and a little chair for when she got tired. She walked on and on -- far, far to the end of the world. She came to the sun, but it was too hot and terrible, and ate little children. She hurried away, and ran to the moon, but it was much too cold, and also frightening and wicked, and when it saw the child, it said, 'I smell, smell human flesh.' Then she hurried away, and came to the stars, and they were friendly and good to her, each one sitting on its own little chair. When the morning star arose, it gave her a chicken bone, and said, 'Without that chicken bone you cannot open the glass mountain, and your brothers are inside the glass mountain.' The girl took the bone, wrapped it up well in a cloth, and went on her way again until she came to the glass mountain. The door was locked, and she started to take out the chicken bone, but when she opened up the cloth, it was empty. She had lost the gift of the good stars. What could she do now? She wanted to rescue her brothers, but she had no key to the glass mountain. The good little sister took a knife, cut off one of her little fingers, put it into the door, and fortunately the door opened. After she had gone inside a little dwarf came up to her and said, 'My child, what are you looking for?' 'I am looking for my brothers, the seven ravens,' she replied. The dwarf said, 'The lord ravens are not at home, but if you want to wait here until they return, step inside.' Then the dwarf carried in the ravens' dinner on seven little plates, and in seven little cups. The sister ate a little bit from each plate and took a little sip from each cup. Into the last cup she dropped the ring that she had brought with her. Suddenly she heard a whirring and rushing sound in the air, and the dwarf said, 'The lord ravens are flying home now.' They came, wanted to eat and drink, and looked for their plates and cups. Then one after the other of them said, 'Who has been eating from my plate? Who has been drinking from my cup? It was a human mouth.' When the seventh one came to the bottom of his cup, the ring rolled toward him. Looking at it, he saw that it was a ring from their father and mother, and said, 'God grant that our sister might be here; then we would be set free.' The girl was listening from behind the door, and when she heard this wish she came forth. Then the ravens were restored to their human forms again. They hugged and kissed one another, and went home happily.", "title": "The Seven Ravens", "id": 608}

She meant that she wanted to have for a son-in-law a man skillful in building canoes. Her daughter obeyed her commands and refused the wooings of all young men. One night a youth came to her bed.

{"label": "700", "text": "There was once upon a time a boy named Lars, and because he was so very little he was called 'Little Lasse.' He was a plucky boy, for once he travelled all round the world in a pea-pod boat. It was Summer-time, when the peas grew green and tall in the garden. Little Lasse crept into the pea-bed between the rows of peas, where the pea-stalks reached high above his cap, and broke off seventeen large pods, the biggest and straightest he could possibly have wished for. Little Lasse thought that no one saw him, and that was stupid, for God's eyes for God's eyes are every where. Then the Gardener came past with his gun upon his shoulder and heard some thing rustle among the peas. 'I think it must be Sparrows,' he called out. ''Sh! 'sh!' but no Sparrow flew out, for Little Lasse had no wings, only two little legs. 'Stop a a moment; I shall load my gun and shoot the Sparrows, ' said the Gardener. Then Little Lasse got frightened and crept out from the rows of peas. 'I am so sorry, Gardener, dear,' he said; 'I was only seeking some nice boats.' 'That excuse may do for this time, ' said the Gardener, ' but in future Little Lasse must ask leave if he wishes to search for ships in the pea-beds.' 'I'll do that,' answered Lasse, and off he was to the shore. There he split up his pods with a pin, slit them quite evenly, and broke up some small twigs for rowing benches. Then he took the peas which had been in the pods, and laid them as cargo in the boats. Some of the pods broke, some remained whole, and when all were ready Little Lasse had twelve boats, but they were they were never boats, they were large war-vessels. He had three ships of the line, three frigates, three brigs, and three schooners. The biggest ship of the line was called Hercules, and the smallest schooner was called The Flea. Little Lasse placed all twelve in the water, and they floated in such a stately manner that no real ship ever danced more proudly on the ocean's billows. Now the ships were to travel round the world. The big island far away there was Asia; the large stone was Africa; the little island was America; the small stones were Polynesia, and the shore from where the ships sailed was Europe. The whole fleet started and floated slowly away to the different parts of the world. The ships of the line sailed straight for Asia; the frigates sailed to Africa, the brigs to America, and the schooners to Polynesia. Little Lasse remained behind in Europe and threw small stones into the world's ocean. On the shore of Europe there was a real boat, papa's own, beautiful, white painted boat, and Little Lasse climbed into it. The pea-boats had sailed so far away, that to the eye they seemed like mere stalks of grass on the water. Little Lasse suddenly conceived a desire to row out into the world. That Papa and Mamma had certainly forbidden, but he never thought of that. 'I shall row a little bit -- just a little bit out,' thought he. 'I shall catch up the ship Hercules near the coast of Asia, and then row back to Europe again.' Little Lasse only shook the chain by which the boat was attached, so it was rather a wonder that it became unloosed. 'Ritsch, ratsch, a man is a man,' and Little Lasse shot out the boat. Now he had to row, and row he could, for he had rowed so often on the stair at home, with the stair for a boat and Papa's big stick as an oar. But when little Lasse wished to row he found there were no oars in the boat; these were kept in the boat-house, and Little Lasse had never noticed that the boat was empty. It is not so easy as one may think to row to Asia without oars. What was Little Lasse to do? The boat was now some distance out on the water, and the wind which blew from the shore was always driving it further. Little Lasse got frightened and began to cry; no one was on the shore, so no one heard him. Only a big crow sat by himself in the big birch-tree, beneath which crept the Gardener's black cat and lay in wait for the crow. No one was in the least concerned about Little Lasse, who was drifting out to sea. Ah, how sorry Little Lasse now was that he had been disobedient and got into the boat, doing what his Father and Mother had so often forbidden! Now it is too late! He will never reach land again; perhaps he may perish in the vast sea. What was he to do? When he had cried himself hoarse, and no one heard him, he clasped his little hands and said: 'Good God, do not be angry with Little Lasse!' and then he slept. In spite of the fact that it was now broad daylight, old Nukki Matti sat on the shore of Featherbed Island fishing with his long net for little children. He heard the soft words which Little Lasse had uttered; quickly he drew the boat towards him, and laid Little Lasse to sleep upon the rose-leaf beds, saying to one of his Dreamers: 'Play with Little Lasse that he may not weary!' This was addressed to a little Dream-boy, so very, very little that he was less than Lasse himself. He had blue eyes, fair hair, a red cap with silver band, and a white jacket with a pearl-trimmed collar. He came to Lasse, and said: 'Would you like to travel all round the world?' 'Yes,' said Lasse in his sleep; 'certainly I would.' 'Come then, ' said the Dream-boy, 'let us sail in your pea-ships. You shall sail in Hercules, and I'll travel on The Flea.' So they sailed away from Featherbed Island, and in a short time Hercules and The Flea were on the shores of Asia, far away at the end of the world, where the White Sea flows through Behring Straits and joins the Pacific Ocean. Far away through the winter fogs, Nordenskiold is seen, with the steamship Vega trying to find a passage through the ice. Here it was very, very cold; the mighty icebergs glistened so marvellously, the big whales were housed beneath them and tried in vain to make holes in the ice with their clumsy heads. All around the bleak shores was snow as far as the eye could reach; upon it little grey men walked about, clad in skins and drove in small sledges through the drifts, and dogs were harnessed to the sledges. 'Shall we land here?' asked the Dream-boy. 'No,' said Lasse. 'I am afraid of being swallowed up by the big whales, and the big dogs might bite us. Let us rather travel to another part of the world.' 'All right,' said the Dream-boy with the red cap and silver band; 'we are not far from America,' -- and at that moment they were there. The sun shone, and it was very hot. Tall palm-trees stood in long rows on the shore, bearing cocoanuts on their tops. Men as red as copper rode at a gallop across the vast green plains and threw their spears at buffaloes, which turned on them with their sharp horns. An enormous boaconstrictor had crept up the highest palm and threw itself down on a llama which was eating grass at the foot of the palm. In a twinkling it was all over with the little deer. 'No,' said Lasse. 'I am so afraid of being gored by the big buffaloes; and the big snake might swallow us up. Let us go to some other part of the world.' 'All right,' said the Dream-boy in the white jacket. 'We are only a short way from Polynesia' -- and as he said so, they were there. Here it was still hotter -- as hot as a Russian bath, when water has just been poured upon the stone. Here there grew upon the shore the richest spices, pepper trees, cinnamon, ginger, saffron, coffee and tea shrubs. Brown men, with long ears and thick lips and their faces hideously painted, hunted a yellow-spotted tiger among the tall bamboos on the shore, and the tiger turned round and planted its claws in one of the brown men. Then all took to flight. 'Are we going to land here?' asked the Dream-boy. 'No,' said Little Lasse. 'Don't you see the tiger over there among the pepper trees? Let us go to another part of the world.' 'That's not difficult to do,' said the Dream-boy with the blue eyes. 'We are not far from Africa' -- and as he said that they were there. They anchored at the mouth of a large river, whose banks were as green as the greenest velvet. A short distance from the river there stretched a vast sandy desert. The air was yellow, the sun burned as fiercely as if it were going to burn the earth to ashes, and the inhabitants were as black as the blackest ink. They rode on tall camels through the desert, the lions panted with thirst, and huge crocodiles with their big lizard-like heads gaped with their sharp white teeth out of the river. 'No,' said Little Lasse. 'The sun would burn us up, and the lions and crocodiles hurt us. Let us go to another part of the world.' 'We must just sail back again to Europe,' said the Dream-boy with the light hair -- and at that moment they were there. They reached a shore; it was all so cool, so familiar, so homelike. There stood the tall birch with its drooping leaves. On the top of it sat the old crow, and at the foot of it crept the Gardener's black cat. Not far off was a house which Lasse had seen before. Beside the house was a garden, and in the garden grew some rows of peas with long pea-pods. There was the old Gardener with his gardener's green hat, and he wondered if the cucumbers were ripe. There was Fylax barking on the steps, and when he saw Lasse he wagged his tail. There was old Stina milking the cows in the farmyard. There was a well-known lady, in her checked woollen shawl, watching the linen webs bleach on the green grass. There was an equally well-known gentleman in a yellow summer coat, with a long pipe in his mouth, watching the harvest workers reap the rye in the fields. There were a boy and girl jumping about on the shore, and calling out: 'Little Lasse! Little Lasse! Come in and have bread and butter!' 'Shall we land here?' asked the Dream-boy, winking so roguishly with his blue eyes. 'Come with me, and I'll ask Mamma to give you a piece of bread and butter and a glass of milk, ' said Little Lasse. 'Wait a bit,' said the Dream-boy. And now Little Lasse saw that the kitchen door stood open, and through it there issued a soft delightful hissing, as if one were pouring yellow batter from a spoon into a hot frying-pan. 'Perhaps we should return to Polynesia,' whispered the merry Dream-boy. 'No, the pancakes are frying in Europe,' said Little Lasse, trying to jump ashore, but could not, for the Dream-boy had bound him with fetters of flowers, so that to move was impossible. And now all the little Dreams surrounded him -- thousands and thousands of tiny children -- and they formed a circle round him, singing this little song: The world is so big a place, Bairnie, wee bairnie, Far bigger than thy thoughts can trace, Bairnie, wee bairnie. There are countries warm and cold, Bairnie, wee bairnie; God all things doth safely hold, People live there, great and small, Those dear to God are happy all, If God's angel thee do guide, No harm can ever thee betide, Say, where would'st thou like to rest, Bairnie, wee bairnie? The world is fair, but home is best, Bairnie, wee bairnie. When the Dreams had finished their song, they all hopped off, and Nukki Matti carried Little Lasse back to the boat. For a long time he lay quite still, and seemed to hear the pancakes frizzling over the fire at home. The frizzling became more distinct; Little Lasse seemed to hear it just beside him -- and then he awoke and opened his eyes. Then he lay in the boat, where he had fallen asleep The wind had changed, and while the boat was drifted out with one wind, it was blown back to shore with the other, while Little Lasse was sleeping. What Lasse had imagined to be the frying of pancakes was in reality the gentle ripple of the waves as they lapped against the pebbly beach. Little Lasse rubbed his sleepy eyes, and looked around him. All was as before the crow in the birch, the cat upon the grass, and the pea-pod fleet by the shore. Some of the ships had been wrecked, and some had drifted back to land. Hercules had arrived with his cargo from Asia; The Flea had returned from Polynesia, and all the divisions of the world were precisely where they were before. Little Lasse never knew exactly how it all happened. He had been so often to Featherbed Island, and yet he never knew how playful Dreams can be. He never troubled his head further to find out, but gathered his boats together, and marched up to the house. His brothers and sisters came to meet him, calling out at a dis tance: 'Where have you been all this time, Lasse? Come in and get bread and butter!' But the kitchen door stood open, and he heard a mysterious frying. The Gardener stood at the gate giving an evening watering to the parsley, dill, carrots, and turnips. 'Well,' said he, 'where have you been all this time?' Little Lasse tossed his head, looked dignified, and answered 'I have sailed all round the world in a pea-pod boat.' 'Oh ho,' said the Gardener. As for him, he had forgotten all about Featherbed Islands! But you haven't forgotten them; you know that they exist; you know their shining grotto. The glittering walls never rust, the shimmering diamonds never lose their lustre, and never does music sound so sweet as that which is heard in the grotto in the balmy evening twilight. As the bright stars never grow old, neither do the light airy Dreams in the halls of Feather bed Island. Perhaps you have caught a glimpse of their delicate wings as they flew around your pillow? Perhaps you have met the same Dream-boy with the blue eyes and the fair hair, he who wears a red cap with silver band, and the white jacket with pearls on the collar? Perhaps he has also shown you the different countries and peoples in the world, the chilly wastes and burning deserts, the many-coloured men and wild animals in forest and sea, so that you may learn something; but return gladly to your home? Yes, who knows? Perhaps you also have travelled all round the world in a pea-pod boat? Links to this story in the original Swedish:", "title": "Little Lasse", "id": 610}

'My dear fish,' said Sir Crane, 'I am so sorry that the fisherman is to come tomorrow with his net and take you all away.' 'Oh, what shall we do?' cried the fish. 'Why,' said the crane, if you would only listen to my advice, you will all be saved.' 'Do help us, by all means, Sir Crane; we will be so thankful to you,' said the fish. 'Well, it may be a source of some trouble to me, but that is immaterial; when one can do a kind turn, he ought to do it. I shall take up as many of you as I can at a time, and carry you to a pond at some distance in a forest, where no fisherman can molest you.' So saying, he carried each time a number of fish, and dropped them on a great piece of stone. There he made a hearty meal on as many as he could eat at a time, and left the remainder to dry in the sun. It came to the turn of the crab to be carried. While the crane was flying in the air, the crab saw fish all the way, dried and drying. He cut asunder the neck of the crane with his sharp feet, and, falling into a pond, saved himself and the remaining fish in the pond he had left.

{"label": "333", "text": "What a funny sight it is to see a brood of ducklings with a hen! -- Listen to the story of Jemima Puddle-duck, who was annoyed because the farmer's wife would not let her hatch her own eggs. Her sister-in-law, Mrs. Rebeccah Puddle-duck, was perfectly willing to leave the hatching to some one else -- 'I have not the patience to sit on a nest for twenty-eight days; and no more have you, Jemima. You would let them go cold; you know you would!' 'I wish to hatch my own eggs; I will hatch them all by myself,' quacked Jemima Puddle-duck. She tried to hide her eggs; but they were always found and carried off. Jemima Puddle-duck became quite desperate. She determined to make a nest right away from the farm. She set off on a fine spring afternoon along the cart-road that leads over the hill. She was wearing a shawl and a poke bonnet. When she reached the top of the hill, she saw a wood in the distance. She thought that it looked a safe quiet spot. Jemima Puddle-duck was not much in the habit of flying. She ran downhill a few yards flapping her shawl, and then she jumped off into the air. She flew beautifully when she had got a good start. She skimmed along over the tree-tops until she saw an open place in the middle of the wood, where the trees and brushwood had been cleared. Jemima alighted rather heavily, and began to waddle about in search of a convenient dry nesting-place. She rather fancied a tree-stump amongst some tall fox-gloves. But -- seated upon the stump, she was startled to find an elegantly dressed gentleman reading a newspaper. He had black prick ears and sandy coloured whiskers. 'Quack?' said Jemima Puddle-duck, with her head and her bonnet on one side -- 'Quack?' The gentleman raised his eyes above his newspaper and looked curiously at Jemima -- 'Madam, have you lost your way?' said he. He had a long bushy tail which he was sitting upon, as the stump was somewhat damp. Jemima thought him mighty civil and handsome. She explained that she had not lost her way, but that she was trying to find a convenient dry nesting-place. 'Ah! is that so? indeed!' said the gentleman with sandy whiskers, looking curiously at Jemima. He folded up the newspaper, and put it in his coat-tail pocket. Jemima complained of the superfluous hen. 'Indeed! how interesting! I wish I could meet with that fowl. I would teach it to mind its own business!' 'But as to a nest -- there is no difficulty: I have a sackful of feathers in my wood-shed. No, my dear madam, you will be in nobody's way. You may sit there as long as you like,' said the bushy long-tailed gentleman. He led the way to a very retired, dismal-looking house amongst the fox-gloves. It was built of faggots and turf, and there were two broken pails, one on top of another, by way of a chimney. 'This is my summer residence; you would not find my earth -- my winter house -- so convenient,' said the hospitable gentleman. There was a tumble-down shed at the back of the house, made of old soap-boxes. The gentleman opened the door, and showed Jemima in. The shed was almost quite full of feathers -- it was almost suffocating; but it was comfortable and very soft. Jemima Puddle-duck was rather surprised to find such a vast quantity of feathers. But it was very comfortable; and she made a nest without any trouble at all. When she came out, the sandy whiskered gentleman was sitting on a log reading the newspaper -- at least he had it spread out, but he was looking over the top of it. He was so polite, that he seemed almost sorry to let Jemima go home for the night. He promised to take great care of her nest until she came back again next day. He said he loved eggs and ducklings; he should be proud to see a fine nestful in his wood-shed. Jemima Puddle-duck came every afternoon; she laid nine eggs in the nest. They were greeny white and very large. The foxy gentleman admired them immensely. He used to turn them over and count them when Jemima was not there. At last Jemima told him that she intended to begin to sit next day -- 'and I will bring a bag of corn with me, so that I need never leave my nest until the eggs are hatched. They might catch cold,' said the conscientious Jemima. 'Madam, I beg you not to trouble yourself with a bag; I will provide oats. But before you commence your tedious sitting, I intend to give you a treat. Let us have a dinner-party all to ourselves! 'May I ask you to bring up some herbs from the farm-garden to make a savoury omelette? Sage and thyme, and mint and two onions, and some parsley. I will provide lard for the stuff-lard for the omelette,' said the hospitable gentleman with sandy whiskers. Jemima Puddle-duck was a simpleton: not even the mention of sage and onions made her suspicious. She went round the farm-garden, nibbling off snippets of all the different sorts of herbs that are used for stuffing roast duck. And she waddled into the kitchen, and got two onions out of a basket. The collie-dog Kep met her coming out, 'What are you doing with those onions? Where do you go every afternoon by yourself, Jemima Puddle-duck?' Jemima was rather in awe of the collie; she told him the whole story. The collie listened, with his wise head on one side; he grinned when she described the polite gentleman with sandy whiskers. He asked several questions about the wood, and about the exact position of the house and shed. Then he went out, and trotted down the village. He went to look for two fox-hound puppies who were out at walk with the butcher. Jemima Puddle-duck went up the cart-road for the last time, on a sunny afternoon. She was rather burdened with bunches of herbs and two onions in a bag. She flew over the wood, and alighted opposite the house of the bushy long-tailed gentleman. He was sitting on a log; he sniffed the air, and kept glancing uneasily round the wood. When Jemima alighted he quite jumped. 'Come into the house as soon as you have looked at your eggs. Give me the herbs for the omelette. Be sharp!' He was rather abrupt. Jemima Puddle-duck had never heard him speak like that. She felt surprised, and uncomfortable. While she was inside she heard pattering feet round the back of the shed. Some one with a black nose sniffed at the bottom of the door, and then locked it. Jemima became much alarmed. A moment afterwards there were most awful noises -- barking, baying, growls and howls, squealing and groans. And nothing more was ever seen of that foxy-whiskered gentleman. Presently Kep opened the door of the shed, and let out Jemima Puddle-duck. Unfortunately the puppies rushed in and gobbled up all the eggs before he could stop them. He had a bite on his ear and both the puppies were limping. Jemima Puddle-duck was escorted home in tears on account of those eggs. She laid some more in June, and she was permitted to keep them herself: but only four of them hatched. Jemima Puddle-duck said that it was because of her nerves; but she had always been a bad sitter.", "title": "The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck", "id": 612}
{"label": "306", "text": "Where was it? Where was it not? Once upon a time there was a poor man who had a very pious son who was a shepherd. One day he was grazing his sheep in a very mountainous area when, like someone whose heart was about to break because of a great wish, he uttered a deep sigh toward heaven. Hearing a quiet sound he looked around and saw Saint Peter as a gray old man walking toward him. 'Why are you sighing so, my son?' he asked, 'and what is your wish?' 'My only wish,' he answered respectfully, 'is a bag that can never be filled and a pelt that would make me invisible when I wrap myself in it.' Peter granted these wishes, and then disappeared. The boy left his shepherd's things lying there and made his way to the capital city. Here he hoped to find his luck, for a king lived here who had twelve daughters, eleven of whom wore out at least six pairs of shoes every night. This angered their father because it was costing him a good part of his income, and furthermore some people were thinking ill of his daughters. But in spite of all his cunning he could not discover how they were doing this. Finally the king promised his youngest daughter to the man who could bring the mystery to the light of day. This promise lured a great many suitors to the capital city, but they were all ridiculed by the girls, and they had to withdraw in shame. The shepherd boy, trusting in his pelt, presented himself as well, and the girls, as usual, measured him with spiteful looks. Night came, and the boy, wrapped in his pelt, lay down before their bedroom door, then quickly slipped inside when they went to bed. At midnight a spirit entered and awoke each girl. There was a flurry of activity: they got dressed, made themselves beautiful, then stuffed a travel bag full of shoes. However, the youngest one did not see what was happening. Therefore the invisible shepherd boy, without being noticed, awoke her as well, which frightened the other sisters. However, because it had already happened, they thought it would be best to tempt her to join them. After some hesitation the girl agreed to do so. When everyone was ready the spirit placed a basin on the table. Each sister rubbed some of its contents onto her shoulders, and wings immediately grew from them. The shepherd boy did the same thing, and when they all flew out the window, he flew after them. After flying a few hours they came to a great copper forest and to a well with a copper railing on which were twelve copper cups. Here they refreshed themselves and drank. The youngest one, who was taking this journey for the first time, looked about fearfully. The boy drank as well, and as they were setting forth again, he put into his bag a cup and some leaves that he pulled from a tree,. The tree rustled noisily, sounding through the entire forest. The littlest girl noticed this and warned her sisters that someone was following them, but thinking they were safe, they only laughed at her. They flew onward, and before long they came to a silver forest and to a well with a silver railing. They drank here as before, and the boy again put a cup and a silver twig into his bag. At the sound of the twig being broken from the tree the smallest sister again warned her sisters, but to no avail. Leaving this forest they arrived at a golden forest, and a well with a golden railing and golden cups. They also stopped here, and the boy put a golden cup and a golden twig into his bag. Hearing the cracking sound, the smallest sister alerted the others, but again they did nothing. After leaving this forest they came to a huge mountain cliff, whose moss-covered summit reached steeply toward heaven. They stopped here, and the spirit struck the cliff with a golden wand, upon which it opened up, and they all went through the opening, the boy as well. They entered a marvelous room which opened into a hall that was decorated with fairy-like splendor. Twelve handsome fairy-youths approached them. Ever more servants appeared and busied themselves making all necessary preparations for a magnificent ball. Magical music sounded forth. The doors opened onto a huge dance hall, and everything was happy and gay. As morning approached they returned home just as they had come (and the shepherd boy was with them). They lay down on their beds as though nothing had happened, which their worn-out shoes disproved, then got up at the normal time. The king was waiting impatiently for any news that the shepherd boy might bring, and in only a few minutes he told him everything that had happened. The girls were summoned, and they denied everything. However, the cups and the twigs testified against them, and the littlest sister spoke against them as well, which was why the shepherd boy had awakened her. The king now fulfilled his promise, but the eleven girls were burned to death as sorceresses. Source: G.

{"label": "451", "text": "There was once in the county of Arzano a good woman to whom every year gave a son, until at length there were seven of them, who looked like a syrinx of the god Pan, with seven reeds, one larger than another. And when they had changed their first teeth, they said to Jannetella their mother, 'Hark ye, mother, if, after so many sons, you do not this time have a daughter, we are resolved to leave home, and go wandering through the world like the sons of the blackbirds.' When their mother heard this sad announcement, she prayed Heaven to remove such an intention from her sons, and prevent her losing seven such jewels as they were. But the sons said to Jannetella, 'We will retire to the top of yonder hill or rock opposite; if Heaven sends you another son, put an inkstand and a pen up at the window; but if you have a little girl, put up a spoon and a distaff. For if we see the signal of a daughter, we shall return home and spend the rest of our lives under your wings; but if we see the signal of a son, then forget us, for you may know that we have taken ourselves off.' Soon after the sons had departed it pleased Heaven that Jannetella should have given her a pretty little daughter; then she told the nurse to make the signal to the brothers, but the woman was so stupid and confused that she put up the inkstand and the pen. As soon as the seven brothers saw this signal, they set off, and walked on and on, until at the end of three years they came to a wood, where the trees were performing the sword-dance to the sound of a river which made counterpoint upon the stones. In this wood was the house of an ogre, whose eyes having been blinded whilst asleep by a woman, he was such an enemy to the sex that he devoured all whom he could catch. When the youths arrived at the ogre's house, tired out with walking and exhausted with hunger, they begged him for pity's sake to give them a morsel of bread. And the ogre replied, that if they would serve him, he would give them food, and they would have nothing else to do but to watch over him, like a dog, each in turn for a day. The youths, upon hearing this, thought they had found mother and father; so they consented, and remained in the service of the ogre, who having gotten their names by heart, called one time Giangrazio, at another Cecchitiello, now Pascale, now Nuccio, now Pone, now Pezzillo, and now Carcavecchia, for so the brothers were named; and giving them a room in the lower part of his house, he allowed them enough to live upon. Meanwhile their sister had grown up; and hearing that her seven brothers, owing to the stupidity of the nurse, had set out to walk through the world, and that no tidings of them had ever been received, she took it into her head to go in search of them. And she begged and prayed her mother so long, that at last, overcome by her entreaties, she gave her leave to go, and dressed her like a pilgrim. Then the maiden walked and walked, asking at every place she came to whether anyone had seen seven brothers. And thus she journeyed on, until at length she got news of them at an inn, where having inquired the way to the wood, one morning, she arrived at the ogre's house, where she was recognized by her brothers with great joy, who cursed the inkstand and pen for writing falsely such misfortune for them. Then giving her a thousand caresses, they told her to remain quiet in their chamber, that the ogre might not see her; bidding her at the same time give a portion of whatever she had to eat to a cat which was in the room, or otherwise she would do her some harm. Cianna (for so the sister was named) wrote down this advice in the pocket-book of her heart, and shared everything with the cat, like a good companion, always cutting justly, and saying, 'This for me, this for thee, this for the daughter of the king!' giving the cat a share to the last morsel. Now it happened one day that the brothers, going to hunt for the ogre, left Cianna a little basket of chickpeas to cook; and as she was picking them, by ill luck she found among them a hazelnut, which was the stone of disturbance to her quiet; for having swallowed it without giving half to the cat, the latter out of spite ran up to the hearth and put out the fire. Cianna seeing this, and not knowing what to do, left the room, contrary to the command of her brothers, and going into the ogre's chamber begged him for a little fire. Then the ogre, hearing a woman's voice, said, 'Welcome, madam! Wait a while, you have found what you are seeking.' And so saying he took a Genoa stone, and daubing it with oil he fell to whetting his tusks. But Cianna, who saw that she had made a mistake, seizing a lighted stick, ran to her chamber; and bolting the door inside, she placed against it bars, stools, bedsteads, tables, stones, and everything there was in the room. As soon as the ogre had put an edge on his teeth he ran to the chamber of the brothers, and finding the door fastened, he fell to kicking it to break it open. At this noise and disturbance the seven brothers came home, and hearing themselves accused by the ogre of treachery for making their chamber the abode of his women-enemies, Giangrazio, who was the eldest and had more sense than the others, and saw matters going badly, said to the ogre, 'We know nothing of this affair, and it may be that this wicked woman has perchance come into the room whilst we were at the chase; but as she has fortified herself inside, come with me, and I will take you to a place where we can seize her without her being able to defend herself.' Then they took the ogre by the hand, and led him to a deep, deep pit, where giving him a push they sent him headlong to the bottom; and taking a shovel, which they found on the ground, they covered him with earth. Then they bade their sister unfasten the door, and they rated her soundly for the fault she had committed, and the danger in which she had placed herself; telling her to be more careful in future, and to beware of plucking grass upon the spot where the ogre was buried, or they would be turned into seven doves. 'Heaven keep me from bringing such a misfortune upon you!' replied Cianna. So taking possession of all the ogre's goods and chattels, and making themselves masters of the whole house, they lived there merrily enough, waiting until winter should pass away. Now it happened one day, when the brothers were gone to the mountains to get firewood, to defend themselves against the cold, which increased from day to day, that a poor pilgrim came to the ogre's wood, and made faces at an ape that was perched up in a pine tree; whereupon the ape threw down one of the fir apples from the tree upon the man's pate, which made such a terrible bump that the poor fellow set up a loud cry. Cianna hearing the noise went out, and taking pity on his disaster, she quickly plucked a sprig of rosemary from a tuft which grew upon the ogre's grave; then she made him a plaster of it with chewed bread and salt, and after giving the man some breakfast she sent him away. Whilst Cianna was laying the cloth, and expecting her brothers, lo! she saw seven doves come flying, who said to her, 'Ah! better that your hand had been cut off, you cause of all our misfortune, ere it plucked that accursed rosemary and brought such a calamity upon us! Have you eaten the brains of a cat, O sister, that you have driven our advice from your mind? Behold us turned to birds, a prey to the talons of kites, hawks, and falcons! Behold us made companions of water-hens, snipes, goldfinches, woodpeckers, jays, owls, magpies, jackdaws, rooks, starlings, woodcocks, cocks, hens and chickens, turkey-cocks, blackbirds, thrushes, chaffinches, tomtits, jenny-wrens, lapwings, linnets, greenfinches, crossbills, flycatchers, larks, plovers, kingfishers, wagtails, redbreasts, red finches, sparrows, ducks, fieldfares, wood-pigeons and bullfinches! A rare thing you have done! And now we may return to our country to find nets laid and twigs limed for us! To heal the head of a pilgrim, you have broken the heads of seven brothers; nor is there any help for our misfortune, unless you find the Mother of Time, who will tell you the way to get us out of trouble.' Cianna, looking like a plucked quail at the fault she had committed, begged pardon of her brothers, and offered to go round the world until she should find the dwelling of the old woman. Then praying them not to stir from the house until she returned, lest any ill should betide them, she set out, and journeyed on and on without ever tiring; and though she went on foot, her desire to aid her brothers served her as a sumpter-mule, with which she made three miles an hour. At last she came to the seashore, where with the blows of the waves the sea was banging the rocks. Here she saw a huge whale, who said to her, 'My pretty maiden, what go you seeking?' And she replied, 'I am seeking the dwelling of the Mother of Time.' 'Hear then what you must do,' replied the whale. 'Go straight along this shore, and on coming to the first river, follow it up to its source, and you will meet with someone who will show you the way. But do me one kindness. When you find the good old woman, beg of her the favor to tell me some means by which I may swim about safely, without so often knocking upon the rocks and being thrown on the sands.' 'Trust to me,' said Cianna. Then thanking the whale for pointing out the way, she set off walking along the shore; and after a long journey she came to the river, which was disbursing itself into the sea. Then taking the way up to its source, she arrived at a beautiful open country, where the meadow vied with the heaven, displaying her green mantle starred over with flowers. And there she met a mouse, who said to her, 'Whither are you going thus alone, my pretty girl?' And Cianna replied, 'I am seeking the Mother of Time.' 'You have a long way to go,' said the mouse; 'but do not lose heart. Everything has an end. Walk on therefore toward yon mountains, and you will soon have more news of what you are seeking. But do me one favor. When you arrive at the house you wish to find, get the good old woman to tell you what we can do to get rid of the tyranny of the cats; then command me, and I am your slave.' Cianna, after promising to do the mouse this kindness, set off toward the mountains, which, although they appeared to be close at hand, seemed never to be reached. But having come to them at length, she sat down tired out upon a stone; and there she saw an army of ants carrying a large store of grain, one of whom turning to Cianna said, 'Who art thou, and whither art thou going?' And Cianna, who was courteous to everyone, said to her, 'I am an unhappy girl, who for a matter that concerns me am seeking the dwelling of the Mother of Time.' 'Go on farther,' replied the ant, 'and where these mountains open into a large plain you will obtain more news. But do me a great favor. Set the secret from the old woman what we ants can do to live a little longer; for it seems to me a folly in worldly affairs to be heaping up such a large store of food for so short a life.' 'Be at ease,' said Cianna. 'I will return the kindness you have shown me.' Then she passed the mountains and arrived at a wide plain; and proceeding a little way over it, she came to a large oak tree, whose fruit tasted like sweetmeats to the maiden, who was satisfied with little. Then the oak, making lips of its bark and a tongue of its pith, said to Cianna, 'Whither are you going so sad, my little daughter? Come and rest under my shade.' Cianna thanked him much, but excused herself, saying that she was going in haste to find the Mother of Time. And when the oak heard this he replied, 'You are not far from her dwelling; for before you have gone another day's journey you will see upon a mountain a house, in which you will find her whom you seek. But if you have as much kindness as beauty, I prithee learn for me what I can do to regain my lost honor; for instead of being food for great men, I am now only made the food of hogs.' 'Leave that to me,' replied Cianna. 'I will take care to serve you.' So saying she departed, and walking on and on without ever resting, she came at length to the foot of an impertinent mountain, which was poking its head into the face of the clouds. There she found an old man, who wearied and way-worn had lain down upon some hay. And as soon as he saw Cianna, he knew her at once, and that it was she who had cured his bump. When the old man heard what she was seeking, he told her that he was carrying to Time the rent for the piece of earth which he had cultivated, and that Time was a tyrant who usurped everything in the world, claiming tribute from all, and especially from people of his age; and he added that, having received kindness from Cianna, he would now return it a hundredfold, by giving her some good information about her arrival at the mountain; and that he was sorry he could not accompany her thither, since his old age, which was condemned rather to go down than up, obliged him to remain at the foot of those mountains, to cast up accounts with the clerks of Time, which are the labors, the sufferings, and the infirmities of life, and to pay the debt of Nature. So the old man said to her, 'Now, my pretty innocent child, listen to me. You must know that on the top of this mountain you will find a ruined house, which was built long ago time out of mind; the walls are cracked, the foundations crumbling away, the doors worm eaten, the furniture all worn out, and in short everything is gone to wrack and ruin. On one side are seen shattered columns, on another broken statues, and nothing is left in a good state except a coat-of-arms over the door, quartered, on which you will see a serpent biting its tail, a stag, a raven, and a phoenix. When you enter, you will see on the ground files, saws, scythes, sickles, pruning-hooks, and hundreds and hundreds of vessels full of ashes, with the names written on them, like gallipots in an apothecary's shop; and there may be read Corinth, Saguntum, Carthage, Troy, and a thousand other cities, the ashes of which Time preserves as trophies of his conquests. When you come near the house, hide yourself until Time goes out; and as soon as he has gone forth, enter, and you will find an old, old woman, with a beard that touches the ground and a hump reaching to the sky. Her hair, like the tail of a dapple-gray horse, covers her heels; her face looks like a plaited collar, with the folds stiffened by the starch of years. The old woman is seated upon a clock, which is fastened to a wall; and her eyebrows are so large that they overshadow her eyes, so that she will not be able to see you. As soon as you enter, quickly take the weights off the clock; then call to the old woman, and beg her to answer your questions; whereupon she will instantly call her son to come and eat you up; but the clock upon which the old woman sits having lost its weights, her son cannot move, and she will therefore be obliged to tell you what you wish. But do not trust any oath she may make, unless she swear by the wings of her son. Then give faith to her, and do what she tells you, and you will be content.' So saying, the poor old man fell down and crumbled away, like a dead body brought from a catacomb to the light of day. Then Cianna took the ashes, and mixing them with a pint of tears, she made a grave and buried them, praying Heaven to grant them quiet and repose. And ascending the mountain, till she was quite out of breath, she waited until Time came out, who was an old man with a long, long beard, and who wore a very old cloak covered with slips of paper, on which were worked the names of various people. He had large wings, and ran so fast that he was out of sight in an instant. When Cianna entered the house of his mother, she started with affright at the sight of that black old chip; and instantly seizing the weights of the clock, she told what she wanted to the old woman, who setting up a loud cry called to her son. But Cianna said to her, 'You may butt your head against the wall as long as you like, for you will not see your son whilst I hold these clock-weights.' Thereupon the old woman, seeing herself foiled, began to coax Cianna, saying, 'Let go of them, my dear, and do not stop my son's course; for no man living has ever done that. Let go of them, and may Heaven preserve you! for I promise you by the aquafortis of my son, with which he corrodes everything, that I will do you no harm.' 'That's time lost,' answered Cianna. 'You must say something better if you would have me quit my hold.' 'I swear to you by those teeth which gnaw all mortal things, that I will tell you all you desire.' 'That is all nothing,' answered Cianna; 'for I know you are deceiving me.' 'Well then,' said the old woman, 'I swear to you by those wings which fly over all, that I will give you more pleasure than you imagine.' Thereupon Cianna, letting go the weights, kissed the old woman's hand, which had a moldy feel and a musty smell. And the old woman, seeing the courtesy of the damsel, said to her, 'Hide yourself behind this door, and when Time comes home I will make him tell me all you wish to know. And as soon as he goes out again, for he never stays quiet in one place, you can depart. But do not let yourself be heard or seen, for he is such a glutton that he does not spare even his own children; and when all fails, he devours himself, and then springs up anew.' Cianna did as the old woman told her, and lo! soon after Time came flying quick, quick, high, and light, and having gnawed whatever came to hand, down to the very moldiness upon the walls, he was about to depart, when his mother told him all she had heard from Cianna, beseeching him to answer exactly all her questions. After a thousand entreaties her son replied, 'To the tree may be answered, that it can never be prized by men so long as it keeps treasures buried under its roots To the mice, that they will never be safe from the cat, unless they tie a bell to her leg, to tell them when she is coming. To the ants, that they will live a hundred years, if they can dispense with flying; for when the ant is going to die she puts on wings. To the whale, that it should be of good cheer, and make friends with the sea-mouse, who will serve him as a guide, so that he will never go wrong. And to the doves, that when they alight on the column of wealth, they will return to their former state.' So saying, Time set out to run his accustomed post; and Cianna, taking leave of the old woman, descended to the foot of the mountain, just at the very time that the seven doves, who had followed their sister's footsteps, arrived there. Wearied with flying so far, they stopped to rest upon the horn of a dead ox; and no sooner had they alighted, than they were changed into handsome youths, as they were at first. But while they were marveling at this, they heard the reply which Time had given, and saw at once that the horn, as the symbol of plenty, was the column of wealth of which Time had spoken. Then embracing their sister with great joy, they all set out on the same road by which Cianna had come. And when they came to the oak tree, and told it what Cianna had heard from Time, the tree begged them to take away the treasure from its roots, since it was the cause why its acorns had lost their reputation. Thereupon the seven brothers, taking a spade which they found in a garden, dug and dug, until they came to a great heap of gold money, which they divided into eight parts, and shared among themselves and their sister, so that they might carry it away conveniently. But being wearied with the journey and the load, they laid themselves down to sleep under a hedge. Presently a band of robbers coming by, and seeing the poor fellows asleep, with their heads upon the cloths full of dollars, bound them hand and foot to some trees, and took away the money, leaving them to bewail not only their wealth, which had slipped through their fingers as soon as found, but their life; for being without hope of succor, they were in peril of either soon dying of starvation or allaying the hunger of some wild beast. As they were lamenting their unhappy lot, up came the mouse, who, as soon as she heard the reply which Time had given, in return for the good service nibbled the cords with which they were bound and set them free. And having gone a little way farther they met on the road the ant, who, when she heard the advice of Time, asked Cianna what was the matter, that she was so pale-faced and cast down. And when Cianna told her their misfortune, and the trick which the robbers had played them, the ant replied, 'Be quiet, I can now requite the kindness you have done me. You must know, that whilst I was carrying a load of grain underground, I saw a place where these dogs of assassins hide their plunder; they have made some holes under an old building, in which they shut up all the things they have stolen. They are just now gone out for some new robbery, and I will go with you and show you the place, so that you may recover your money.' So saying she took the way toward some tumble-down houses, and showed the seven brothers the mouth of a pit; whereupon Giangrazio, who was bolder than the rest, entering it, found there all the money of which they had been robbed. Then taking it with them, they set out, and walked towards the seashore, where they found the whale, and told him the good advice which Time -- who is the father of counsel -- had given them. And whilst they stood talking of their journey, and all that had befallen them, they saw the robbers suddenly appear, armed to the teeth, who had followed in their footsteps. At this sight they exclaimed, 'Alas, alas! we are now wholly lost, for here come the robbers armed, and they will not leave the skin on our bodies!' 'Fear not,' replied the whale,' for I can save you out of the fire, and will thus requite the love you have shown me. So get upon my back, and I will quickly carry you to a place of safety.' Cianna and her brothers, seeing the foe at their heels and the water up to their throat, climbed upon the whale, who, keeping far off from the rocks, carried them to within sight of Naples; but being afraid to land them on account of the shoals and shallows, he said, 'Where would you like me to land you? On the shore of Amalfi? ' And Giangrazio answered, 'See whether that cannot be avoided, my dear fish; I do not wish to land at any place hereabouts; for at Massa they say barely good-day, at Sorrento thieves are plenty, at Vico they say you may go your way, at Castel-a-Mare no one says how are ye?' Then the whale, to please them, turned about and went toward the Salt-Rock, where he left them; and they got put on shore by the first fishing boat that passed. Thereupon they returned to their own country, safe and sound and rich, to the great joy and consolation of their mother and father; and, thanks to the goodness of Cianna, they enjoyed a happy life, verifying the old saying, Do good whenever you can, and forget it.", "title": "The Seven Doves", "id": 614}
{"label": "332", "text": "A Legend from Dauphin\u00c3\u00a9 Once upon a time there was a man who had twelve children, and a thirteenth came to him. Very sadly he was walking along the path. He met a tall woman: It was Death. She said to him: 'What is it, my friend, that you are so sad?' 'In order to have my child baptized, I am looking for godfathers and godmothers, and I cannot find any.' The tall woman said, 'Well! I will be your little one's godmother.' When the child was grown, he was very intelligent. His godmother had him raised to be a doctor. She gave him the gift of being a skilled doctor. Before he went to his first patient, Death gave him this secret: 'My godson, if you see me at the head of the bed, you can say that the patient will not recover, but if you see me at the foot of the bed, you can say with complete certainty that you will heal him.' This secret gave the doctor a great reputation, and the king heard about his great skill. The king's daughter became ill. The king summoned the doctor and said to him: 'If you cure my daughter, I will give her to you in marriage.' When the doctor came to the patient, Death was at her head. The doctor thought: 'What should I do?' He immediately brought in four men and had them turn the bed so that Death was now at the foot. Thus the skillful doctor cured the king's daughter, and the king showered him with riches. However, Death called him to the underground where the candles of life were, and admonished him that if he ever returned, he would die. Death forgave him the first time. Then the king became ill, and he called the doctor back. Death was at the head of the bed. The doctor used the same stratagem as for the girl: He turned the foot of the bed to the head, and Death thus found himself at the foot. The king was healed. However, Death called the skillful doctor back to the underground and told him that he had broken his promise and abused her kindness. Death showed him his candle which was burnt up. The doctor had to die. All his gifts and all his fortune were of no use to him against Death.", "title": "The Godson of Death", "id": 615}

Reason on lonely people sheds no ray. It's good to speak -- better to silent stay: Both in excess are bad. No animal Was ever seen, or was within a call. Bear though he was, he wearied of this life, And longed for the world's joy and the world's strife. Then 'Melancholy marked him for her own.' Not far from him an old man lived alone. Dull as the bear, he loved his garden well; Was priest of Flora and Pomona; still, Though the employment's pleasant, a kind friend Is needfull, its full charms to it to lend. Gardens talk little, save in my small book. Weary at last of their mere smiling look, And those his dumb companions, one fine day, Our man set forth upon his lonely way, To seek a friend. The bear, with the same thought, Had left his mountain, satisfied with naught. By chance most strange the two adventurers meet At the same turning. He's afraid to greet The bear; but fly he can't. What can he do? Well, like a Gascon, he gets neatly through: Conceals his fright. The bear is not well bred; 'Here is my cottage; pray come in, my lord;' Still growls, 'Come see me!' but the other said, 'Do me the honor at my frugal board To lunch al fresco. I have milk and fruit, That will, perhaps, your worship's pleasure suit For once, though not your ordinary fare. I offer all I have.' With friendly air They're chums already before reaching home; Still better friends when there they've fairly come. In my opinion it's a golden rule: Better be lonely than be with a fool. The bear, who did not speak two words a day, Left the drudge there to work and toil away. Bruin went hunting, and brought in the game, Or flapped the blow-flies, when the blow-flies came; And kept from off his sleeping partner's face Of wing\u00c3\u00a8d parasites the teasing race. One day a buzzer o'er the sleeping man Poised, and then settled on his nose -- their plan. The bear was crazy: all his chase was vain; 'I'll catch you, thief!' he cried. It came again. 'Twas said, 'twas done: The flapper seized a stone, And launched it bravely -- bravely it was thrown. He crushed the fly, but smashed the poor man's skull -- A sturdy thrower, but a reasoner dull.

{"label": "1161", "text": "Once upon a time there was a man up in Finnmark who had caught a large white bear, which he was going to take to the King of Denmark. It so happened that he came to the Dovrefjell on Christmas Eve. He went to a cottage where a man lived whose name was Halvor, and he asked the man for lodging for himself and his white bear. 'God bless us!' said the man, 'but we can't give anyone lodging just now, for every Christmas Eve the house is so full of trolls that we are forced to move out, and we'll have no shelter over our own heads, to say nothing of providing for anyone else.' 'Oh?' said the man, 'If that's all, you can very well let me use your house. My bear can sleep under the stove here, and I can sleep in the storeroom.' Well, he begged so hard, that at last he got permission to stay there. The people of the house moved out, but before they went, everything was made ready for the trolls. The table was set with cream porridge and fish and sausages and everything else that was good, just as for any other grand feast. When everything was ready, in came the trolls. Some were large, and some were small. Some had long tails, and some had no tails at all. And some had long, long noses. They ate and drank and tasted everything. Then one of the troll youngsters saw the white bear lying under the stove, so he took a piece of sausage, stuck it onto a fork, and went and poked it against the white bear's nose, burning it. Then he shrieked, 'Kitty, do you want some sausage?' The white bear rose up and growled, and then chased the whole pack of them out, both large and small. A year later Halvor was out in the woods at midday of Christmas Eve, gathering wood for the holidays, for he expected the trolls again. As he was chopping, he heard a voice shouting from the woods, 'Halvor! Halvor!' 'Yes?' said Halvor. 'Do you still have that big cat?' 'Yes,' said Halvor. 'She's lying at home under the stove, and what's more, she now has seven kittens, far bigger and fiercer than she is herself.' 'Then, we'll never come to your place again,' shouted the troll in the woods, and since that time the trolls have never eaten their Yule porridge with Halvor on the Dovrefjell.'", "title": "The Cat on the Dovrefjell", "id": 617}

In these days in a border village in Kasi there dwelt a number of carpenters. And it chanced that one of them, a bald gray-haired man, was planing away at some wood with his head glistening like a copper bowl, when a mosquito settled on his scalp and stung him with its dart like sting. Said the carpenter to his son, who was seated hard by, 'My boy, there's a mosquito stinging me on the head. Do drive it away.' 'Hold still then father,' said the son. 'One blow will settle it.' (At that very time the Bodhisatta had reached that village in the way of trade, and was sitting in the carpenter's shop.) 'Rid me of it!' cried the father. 'All right, father,' answered the son, who was behind the old man's back, and, raising a sharp ax on high with intent to kill only the mosquito, he cleft his father's head in two. So the old man fell dead on the spot. Thought the Bodhisatta, who had been an eye witness of the whole scene, 'Better than such a friend is an enemy with sense, whom fear of men's vengeance will deter from killing a man.' And he recited these lines: So saying, the Bodhisatta rose up and departed, passing away in after days to fare according to his deserts.

{"label": "503", "text": "The tailor thought about his dear fianc\u00c3\u00a9e, whom he had left at home, and sighed because he was so poor that the musicians would not be playing at their wedding dance. As they walked along the music sounded nearer and nearer, and at last on a hill they saw many small figures, little men and little women, holding hands and dancing in a circle around an old man. They were singing (that was the music), and one after the other they bowed before the old man. The old man was somewhat larger than the others, had a long ice-gray beard that hung down low over his chest, had a majestic appearance, and was magnificently dressed. The tailor and the goldsmith stood there amazed and could not see enough. Then the old man motioned to them; the dancers opened their circle; and the goldsmith, who was a small hunchbacked fellow, stepped inside. The frightened tailor stayed where he was, but when he saw how the little men and women welcomed his companion, he took heart and followed him into the circle. With the circle now closed, the little people continued to dance and to sing. The old man took a long, broad knife, whetted it until it glistened brightly, and then shaved off the hair and the beards of the tailor and the goldsmith. They shook with fear that their heads would be next, but the old man patted them friendly on their shoulders, as if to say that it was good that they had not resisted. Afterward he pointed to a pile of coal that lay nearby, indicating to them with gestures that they should fill their pockets with it. The goldsmith, who was greedy by nature, took much more than did the tailor, even though the coal had no value. Then the two of them walked down the hill to seek shelter for the night, looking back repeatedly at the tiny dancers. The music sounded more distant and more softly. The monastery bell in the valley struck twelve, and suddenly the hill was empty. Everything had disappeared. Once at the inn the two wanderers covered themselves with their jackets, and because they were very tired, they forgot to take the coal out of their pockets. They awakened earlier than usual, because their jackets were pushing down on them like lead. They reached into the pockets and could not believe their eyes when they saw that they contained pure gold instead of coal. The goldsmith estimated that his was worth thirty thousand thalers, and the tailor's fifteen thousand. Furthermore, their hair and beards had been restored as well. They praised the old man on the mountain, and the goldsmith said, 'Do you know what? Let's go back this evening and fill our pockets clear full.' But the tailor did not want to do this. 'I have enough,' he said, 'and am satisfied. Now I can become a master tailor and marry my Margaret. We will manage beautifully.' The goldsmith did not want to journey onward, and because they had traveled together for a long time, as a favor the tailor spent the day with him at the inn. As evening approached, the goldsmith hung several bags over his shoulders and went back to the hill. He heard the music, as they had before, and saw the little dancers with the old man in the middle. And the old man again motioned to him, shaved him, indicating that he should take some coal. He gathered up as much as he could carry away, hurried back to the village inn, covered himself with his jacket, and could not fall asleep in anticipation that the pockets and bags, now filled with light coal, would be getting heavier and heavier. But on earth not everything happens the way foolish people think it will. The pockets and bags remained light. As dawn approached he went to the window and looked at each piece of coal. It was ordinary coal, and it made his fingers black. Frightened, he fetched the gold from the previous day, but it no longer glistened. Everything had turned back into coal. Then he awakened the tailor in order to share his sorrow with him. When the tailor saw him he was horrified. Only now did the goldsmith discover his entire misfortune. His hair and his beard had been shaved off completely, and they never grew back. But the worst thing was this: he had had a hump on his back, but now he had one of the same size on his chest, and would be unable to work. He recognized this as punishment for his greed, and began to cry bitterly. However, the tailor comforted him, saying, 'Since we have been good traveling companions for so long, and since we found the treasure together, from now on you can live with me and share my treasure.' The tailor soon became a master and married his Margaret. He had many pious children and always enough work; and he is still taking care of the goldsmith with the two humps and no hair.", "title": "The Gifts of the Mountain Spirits", "id": 620}

The bear asked the disputants, 'What are you quarreling about?' 'We are arguing about the question as to how many ways each of us has to save his life in time of danger,' they answered. The bear first asked the wolf, 'Now, how many ways do you have to escape?' 'A hundred,' was the answer. 'And you?' he asked the fox. 'A thousand,' he answered. Then the bear asked the hare, 'How many do you know?' 'I have only my fast legs,' was the answer. Finally the bear asked the cat, 'How many ways to escape do you know?' 'Only one,' answered the cat. Then the bear decided to put them all to the test in order to see how each one would save himself in time of danger. He suddenly threw himself at the wolf and crushed him half to death. Seeing what had happened to the wolf, the fox started to run away, but the bear grabbed him by the tip of his tail, and even to this day the fox has a white spot on his tail. The hare, with his fast legs, escaped by running away.

{"label": "706", "text": "It is related that a certain king said to the people of his dominions, 'If any one of you give aught in alms, I will assuredly cut off his hand.' So all the people refrained from alms-giving, and none could bestow upon another. And it happened that a beggar came to a woman one day, and hunger tormented him, and he said to her, 'Give me somewhat as an alms.' 'How,' said she, 'can I bestow an alms upon thee when the king cutteth off the hand of every one who doth so?' But he rejoined, 'I conjure thee by God (whose name be exalted!) that thou give me an alms.' So when he conjured her by God, she was moved with pity for him, and bestowed upon him two cakes of bread. And the news reached the king; whereupon he gave orders to bring her before him; and when she came, he cut off her hands. And she returned to her house. Then the king, after a while, said to his mother, 'I desire to marry; therefore marry me to a comely woman.' And she replied, 'There is, among our female slaves, a woman than whom none more beautiful existeth; but she hath a grievous defect.' 'And what is it?' he asked. She answered, 'She is maimed of the two hands.' The king however said, 'I desire to see her.' Wherefore she brought her to him, and when he saw her, he was tempted by her beauty, and married her. And that woman was she who bestowed upon the beggar the two cakes of bread, and whose hands were cut off on that account. But when he had married her, her fellow-wives envied her, and wrote to the king, telling him that she was unchaste; and she had given birth to a son. And the king wrote a letter to his mother, in which he commanded her to go forth with her to the desert, and to leave her there, and return. His mother therefore did so; she took her forth to the desert, and returned. And that woman began to weep for the misfortune that had befallen her, and to bewail violently, with a wailing not to be exceeded. And while she was walking, with the child upon her neck, she came to a river, and kneeled down to drink, because of the violence of the thirst that had affected her from her walking and fatigue and grief; and when she stooped her head, the child fell into the water. So she sat weeping violently for her child; and while she wept, lo, there passed by her two men, who said to her, 'What causeth thee to weep?' She answered, 'I had a child upon my neck, and he fell into the water.' And they said, 'Dost thou desire that we rescue him, and restore him to thee?' She answered, 'Yes.' And upon this they supplicated God (whose name be exalted!), and the child came forth to her safe and unhurt. Then they said to her, 'Dost thou desire that God should restore to thee thy hands as they were?' And they supplicated God (whose perfection be extolled, and whose name be exalted!); whereupon her hands returned to her in the most perfect state. After this they said to her, 'Knowest thou who we are?' 'God,' she replied, 'is all-knowing.' And they said, 'We are thy two cakes of bread which thou gavest as an alms to the beggar, and which alms occasioned the cutting off of thy hands. Therefore praise God (whose name be exalted!) that he hath restored to thee thy hands and thy child. And she praised God (whose name be exalted!), and glorified him.

{"label": "562", "text": "So late one evening he came to a great forest. He did not know where he should find a shelter for the night, but he went on looking and searching till he caught sight of an old tumble-down hut, which stood in the middle of some bushes. It was not exactly good enough for such a fine cavalier, but when you cannot get what you want you must take what you can get. And, since there was no help for it, he went into the hut. Not a living soul was to be seen; there was not even a stool to sit upon, but alongside the wall stood a big chest. What could there be inside that chest? If only there were some bits of moldy bread in it! How nice they would taste! For, you must know, he had not had a single bit of food the whole day, and he was so hungry and his stomach so empty that it groaned with pain. He lifted the lid. but inside the chest there was another chest, and inside that chest there was another; and so it went on, each one smaller than the other, until they became quite tiny boxes. The more there were the harder he worked away, for there must be something very fine inside, he thought, since it was so well hidden. At last he came to a tiny, little box, and in this box lay a bit of paper -- and that was all he got for his trouble! It was very annoying, of course, but then he discovered there was something written on the paper, and when he looked at it he was just able to spell it out, although at first it looked somewhat difficult. 'Lars, my lad!' As he pronounced these words something answered right in his ear, 'What are master's orders?' He looked round, but he saw nobody. This was very funny, he thought, and so he read out the words once more, 'Lars, my lad!' And the answer came as before, 'What are master's orders?' But he did not see anybody this time either. 'If there is anybody about who hears what I say, then be kind enough to bring me something to eat,' he said. And the next moment there stood a table laid out with all the best things one could think of. He set to work to eat and drink, and had a proper fill. He had never enjoyed himself so much in all his life, he thought. When he had eaten all he could get down, he began to feel sleepy, and so he took out the paper again, 'Lars, my lad!' 'What are master's orders?' 'Well, you have given me food and drink, and now you must get me a bed to sleep in as well. But I want a really fine bed,' he said, for you must know he was a little more bold now that his hunger was stayed. Well, there it stood, a bed so fine and dainty that even the king himself might covet it. Now this was all very well in its way, but when once you are well off you wish for still more, and he had no sooner got into bed than he began to think that the room was altogether too wretched for such a grand bed. So he took out the paper again: 'Lars, my lad!' 'What are master's orders?' 'Since you are able to get me such food and such a bed here in the midst of the wild forest, I suppose you can manage to get me a better room, for you see I am accustomed to sleep in a palace, with golden mirrors and draped walls and ornaments and comforts of all kinds,' he said. Well, he had no sooner spoken the words than he found himself lying in the grandest chamber anybody had ever seen. Now he was comfortable, he thought, and felt quite satisfied as he turned his face to the wall and closed his eyes. But that was not all the grandeur; for when he woke up in the morning and looked round, he saw it was a big palace he had been sleeping in. One room led into the other, and wherever he went the place was full of all sorts of finery and luxuries, both on the walls and on the ceilings, and they glittered so much when the sun shone on them that he had to shade his eyes with his hand, so strong was the glare of gold and silver wherever he turned. He then happened to look out of the window. Good gracious! How grand it was! There was something else than pine forests and juniper bushes to look at, for there was the finest garden anyone could wish for, with splendid trees and roses of all kinds. But he could not see a single human being, or even a cat; and that, you know, was rather lonely, for otherwise he had everything so grand and had been set up as his own master again. So he took out the bit of paper: 'Lars, my lad!' 'What are master's orders?' 'Well, now you have given me food and bed and a palace to live in, I intend to remain here, for I like the place,' he said, 'yet I don't like to live quite by myself. I must have both lads and lasses whom I may order about to wait on me,' he said. And there they were. There came servants and stewards and scullery maids and chambermaids of all sorts, and some came bowing and some curtseying. So now the duke thought he was really satisfied. But now it happened that there was a large palace on the other side of the forest, and there the king lived who owned the forest, and the great, big fields around it. As he was walking up and down in his room he happened to look out through the window and saw the new palace, where the golden weathercocks were swinging to and fro on the roof in the sunlight, dazzling his eyes. 'This is very strange,' he thought; and so he called his courtiers. They came rushing in, and began bowing and scraping. 'Do you see the palace over there?' said the king. They opened their eyes and began to stare. Yes, of course, they saw it. 'Who is it that has dared to build such a palace on my grounds?' said the king. They bowed, and they scraped with their feet, but they did not know anything about it. The king then called his generals and captains. They came, stood at attention and presented arms. 'Be gone, soldiers and troopers,' said the king, 'and pull down the palace over there, and hang him who has built it; and don't lose any time about it!' Well, they set off in great haste to arm themselves, and away they went. The drummers beat the skins of their drums, and the trumpeters blew their trumpets, and the other musicians played and blew as best they could, so that the duke heard them long before he could see them. But he had heard this kind of noise before, and knew what it meant, so he took out his scrap of paper: 'Lars, my lad!' 'What are master's orders?' 'There are soldiers coming here,' he said, 'and now you must provide me with soldiers and horses, that I may have double as many as those over in the wood, and with sabers and pistols, and guns and cannons with all that belongs to them; but be quick about it.' And no time was lost; for when the duke looked out, he saw an immense number of soldiers, who were drawn up around the palace. When the king's men arrived, they came to a sudden halt and dared not advance. But the duke was not afraid; he went straight up to the colonel of the king's soldiers and asked him what he wanted. The colonel told him his errand. 'It's of no use,' said the duke. 'You see how many men I have; and if the king will listen to me, we shall become good friends, and I will help him against his enemies, and in such a way that it will be heard of far and wide,' he said. The colonel was of the same opinion, and the duke then invited him and all his soldiers inside the palace, and the men had more than one glass to drink and plenty of everything to eat as well. But while they were eating and drinking they began talking; and the duke then got to hear that the king had a daughter who was his only child, and was so wonderfully fair and beautiful that no one had ever seen her like before. And the more the king's soldiers ate and drank the more they thought she would suit the duke for a wife. And they went on talking so long that the duke at last began to be of the same opinion. 'The worst of it,' said the soldiers, 'is that she is just as proud as she is beautiful, and will never look at a man.' But the duke laughed at this. 'If that's all,' said the duke, 'there's sure to be a remedy for that complaint.' When the soldiers had eaten and drunk as much as they could find room for, they shouted 'Hurrah!' so that it echoed among the hills, and then they set out homeward. But, as you may imagine, they did not walk exactly in parade order, for they were rather unsteady about the knees, and many of them did not carry their guns in regulation manner. The duke asked them to greet the king from him. He would call on him the following day, he said. When the duke was alone again, he began to think of the princess, and to wonder if she were as beautiful and fair as they had made her out to be. He would like to make sure of it; and as so many strange things had happened that day it might not be impossible to find that out as well, he thought. 'Lars, my lad!' 'What are master's orders?' 'Well, now you must bring me the king's daughter as soon as she has gone to sleep,' he said; 'but she must not be awakened either on the way here or back. Do you hear that?' he said. And before long the princess was lying on the bed. She slept so soundly and looked so wonderfully beautiful as she lay there. Yes, she was as sweet as sugar, I can tell you. The duke walked round about her, but she was just as beautiful from whatever point of view he looked at her. The more he looked the more he liked her. 'Lars, my lad!' 'What are master's orders?' 'You must now carry the princess home,' he said, 'for now I know how she looks and tomorrow I will ask for her hand,' he said. Next morning the king looked out of the window. 'I suppose I shall not be troubled with the sight of that palace anymore,' he thought. But, zounds! There it stood just as on the day before, and the sun shone so brightly on the roof, and the weathercocks dazzled his eyes. He now became furious, and called all his men. They came quicker than usual. The courtiers bowed and scraped, and the soldiers stood at attention and presented arms. 'Do you see the palace there?' screamed the king. They stretched their necks, and stared and gaped. Yes, of course, that they did. 'Have I not ordered you to pull down the palace and hang the builder?' he said. Yes, they could not deny that; but then the colonel himself stepped forward and reported what had happened and how many soldiers the duke had, and how wonderfully grand the palace was. And next he told him what the duke had said, and how he had asked him to give his greetings to the king, and all that sort of thing. The king felt quite confused, and had to put his crown on the table and scratch his head. He could not understand all this, although he was a king; for he could take his oath it had all been built in a single night; and if the duke were not the evil one himself, he must in any case have done it by magic. While he sat pondering, the princess came into the room. 'Good morning to you, father!' she said. 'Just fancy, I had such a strange and beautiful dream last night!' she said. 'What did you dream then, my girl?' said the king. 'I dreamed I was in the new palace over yonder, and that I saw a duke there, so fine and handsome that I could never have imagined the like; and now I want to get married, father,' she said. 'Do you want to get married? -- you, who never cared to look at a man! That's very strange!' said the king. 'That may be.' Said the princess; 'but it's different now, and I want to get married, and it's the duke I want,' she said. The king was quite beside himself, so frightened did he become of the duke. But all of a sudden he heard a terrible noise of drums and trumpets and instruments of all kinds; and then came a message that the duke had just arrived with a large company, all of whom were so grandly dressed that gold and silver glistened in every fold. The king put on his crown and his coronation robes, and then went out on the steps to receive them. And the princess was not slow to follow him. The duke bowed most graciously, and the king of course did likewise, and when they had talked awhile about their affairs and their grandeur they became the best of friends. A great banquet was then prepared, and the duke was placed next to the princess at the table. What they talked about is not easy to tell, but the duke spoke so well for himself that the princess could not very well say 'No' to anything he said, and then he went up to the king and asked for her hand. The king could not exactly say 'No' either, for he could very well see that the duke was a person with whom it was best to be on friendly terms; but give his sanction there and then, he could not very well do that either. He wanted to see the duke's palace first, and find out about the state of affairs over there, as you may understand. So it was arranged that he should visit the duke and take the princess with him to see his palace; and with this they parted company. When the duke returned home, Lars became busier than ever, for there was so much to attend to. But he set to work and strove hard; and when the king and his daughter arrived everything was so magnificent and splendid that no words can describe it. They went through all the rooms and looked about, and they found everything as it should be, and even still more splendid, thought the king, and so he was quite pleased. The wedding then took place, and that in grand style; and on the duke's arrival home with his bride he, too, gave a great feast, and then there was an end to the festivities. Some time passed by, and one evening the duke heard these words: 'Are you satisfied now?' It was Lars, as you may guess, but the duke could not see him. 'Well, I ought to be,' said the duke. 'You have provided me with everything I have,' he said. 'Yes, but what have I got in return?' asked Lars. 'Nothing,' said the duke; 'but, bless me, what could I have given you, who are not of flesh and blood, and whom I cannot see either?' he said. 'But if there is anything I can do for you, tell me what it is, and I shall do it.' 'Well, I should like to ask you for that little scrap of paper which you found in the chest,' said Lars. 'Nothing else?' said the duke. 'If such a trifle can help you, I can easily do without it, for now I begin to know the words by heart,' he said. Lars thanked the duke, and asked him to put the paper on the chair in front of the bed when he retired to rest, and he would be sure to fetch it during the night. The duke did as he was told; and so he and the princess lay down and went to sleep. But early in the morning the duke awoke and felt so cold that his teeth chattered, and when he had got his eyes quite open he found that he was quite naked and had not even as much as a thread on his back; and instead of the grand bed and the beautiful bedroom, and the magnificent palace, he lay on the big chest in the old tumble-down hut. He began to shout, 'Lars, my lad!' But he got no answer. He shouted once more, 'Lars, my lad!' But he got no answer this time either. So he shouted all he could, 'Lars, my lad!' But it was all in vain. Now he began to understand how matters stood. When Lars had got the scrap of paper he was freed from service at the same time, and now he had taken everything with him. But there was no help for it. There stood the duke in the old hut quite naked; and as for the princess she was not much better off, although she had her clothes on, for she had got them from her father, so Lars had no power over them. The duke had now to tell the princess everything, and ask her to leave him. He would have to manage as best he could, he said. But she would not hear of it. She well remembered what the parson had said when he married them, and she would never, never leave him, she said. In the meantime the king in his palace had also awakened, and when he looked out of the window he did not see any sign whatever of the other palace where his daughter and son-in-law lived. He became uneasy, as you may imagine, and called his courtiers. They came in, and began to bow and scrape. 'Do you see the palace over yonder behind the forest?' he asked. They stretched their necks and stared with all their might. No, they did not see it. 'Where had it gone to, then?' asked the king. Well, really they did not know. It was not long before the king set out with all his court through the forest; and when he arrived at the place where the palace with the beautiful gardens should have been, he could not see anything but heather and juniper bushes and firs. But then he discovered the old tumble-down hut, which stood there among the bushes. He entered the hut and -- mercy on us! -- what a sight met his eyes! There stood his son-in-law, quite naked, and his daughter, who had not very many clothes on either, and who was crying and moaning. 'Dear, dear! what does all this mean?' said the king; but he did not get any answer, for the duke would rather have died than tell him. The king did his utmost to get him to speak; but in spite of all the king's promises and threats the duke remained obstinate and would not utter a word. The king then became angry; and no wonder, for now he could see that this grand duke was not what he pretended to be, and so he ordered the duke to be hanged, and that without any loss of time. The princess begged and prayed for mercy; but neither prayers nor tears were of any help now; for an impostor he was, and as an impostor he should die, said the king. And so it had to be. They erected a gallows, and placed the rope round the duke's neck. But while they were getting the gallows ready, the princess got hold of the hangman, and gave both him and his assistant some money, that they should so manage the hanging of the duke that he should not lose his life, and in the night they were to cut him down, so that he and the princess might then flee the country. And that's how the matter was arranged. In the meantime they had strung up the duke, and the king and his court and all the people went their way. The duke was now in great straits. He had, however, plenty of time to reflect how foolish he had been in not saving some of the crumbs when he was living in plenty, and how unpardonably stupid he had been in letting Lars have the scrap of paper. This vexed him more than all. If only he had it again, he thought, they should see he had been gaining some sense in return for all he had lost. But it is of little use snarling if you haven't got any teeth. 'Ah, well, well!' he sighed, and so he dangled his legs, which was really all he could do. The day passed slowly and tediously for him, and he was not at all displeased when he saw the sun setting behind the forest. But just before it disappeared he heard a fearful shouting, and when he looked down the hill, he saw seven cartloads of worn-out shoes, and on the top of the hindmost cart he saw a little old man in gray clothes and with a red pointed cap on his head. His face was like that of the worst scarecrow, and the rest of him was not very handsome either. He drove straight up to the gallows, and when he arrived right under it he stopped and looked up at the duke, and then burst out laughing, the ugly old fellow! 'How stupid you were!' he said; 'but what should the fool do with his stupidity if he did not make use of it?' And then he laughed again. 'Yes, there you are hanging now, and here am I carting away all the shoes I have worn out for your whims. I wonder if you can read what is written on this bit of paper, and if you recognize it?' he said with an ugly laugh, holding up the paper before the duke's eyes. But all who hang are not dead, and this time it was Lars who was befooled. The duke made a clutch, and snatched the paper from him. 'Lars, my lad!' 'What are master's orders?' 'Well, you must cut me down from the gallows and put the palace and all the rest in its place again, exactly as it was before, and when the night has set in you must bring back the princess.' All went merrily as in a dance, and before long everything was in its place, just as it was when Lars took himself off. When the king awoke the next morning he looked out of the window, as was his custom, and there stood the palace again, with the weathercocks glittering so beautifully in the sunshine. He called his courtiers, and they came and began to bow and scrape. They stretched their necks as far as they could, and stared and gaped. 'Do you see the palace over there?' said the king. Yes, of course, they did. The king then sent for the princess, but she was not to be found. He then went out to see if his son-in-law was still hanging on the gallows, but neither son-in-law nor gallows was to be seen. He had to lift off his crown and scratch his head. But that did not improve matters; he could not make head or tail of either one thing or the other. He set off at once with all his court through the forest, and when he came to the place where the palace should stand, there it stood sure enough. The gardens and the roses were exactly as they used to be, and the duke's people were to be seen everywhere among the trees. His son-in-law and his daughter received him on the steps, dressed in their finest clothes. 'Well, I never saw the like of this,' said the king to himself; he could scarcely believe his own eyes, so wonderful did it all seem to him. 'God's peace be with you, father, and welcome here!' said the duke. The king stood staring at him. 'Are you my son-in-law?' he asked. 'Well, I suppose I am,' said the duke. 'Who else should I be?' 'Did I not order you to be hanged yesterday like any common thief?' said the king. 'I think you must have been bewitched on the way,' said the duke, with a laugh. 'Do you think I am the man to let myself be hanged? Or is there anyone here who dares to believe it?' he said, and looked so fiercely at the courtiers that they felt as if they were being pierced through and through. They bowed and scraped and cringed before him. Who could believe such a thing? Was it at all likely? 'Well, if there is anyone who dares to say the king could have wished me such evil, let him speak out,' said the duke, and fixed his eyes upon them still more fiercely than before. They went on bowing and scraping and cringing. How could anyone dare say such a thing? No, they had more sense than that, they should hope. The king did not know what to believe, for when he looked at the duke he thought he never could have wished him such evil; but still he was not quite convinced. 'Did I not come here yesterday, and was not the whole palace gone, and was there not an old hut in its place? And did not I go into that hut, and did not you stand stark naked right before my eyes?' he asked. 'I wonder the king can talk so,' said the duke. 'I think the trolls must have bewitched your eyes in the forest and made you quite crazy; or what do you think?' he said, and turned round to the courtiers. They bowed and bowed till their backs were bent double, and agreed with everything he said, there could be no mistake about that. The king rubbed his eyes, and looked round about him. 'I suppose it is as you say, then,' he said to the duke, 'and it is well I have got back my proper sight and have come to my senses again. For it would have been a sin and a shame if I had let you be hanged,' he said; and so he was happy again, and nobody thought any more about the matter. 'Once bitten, twice shy,' as the proverb says; and the duke now took upon himself to manage and look after most of his affairs, so that it was seldom Lars had to wear out his shoes. The king soon gave the duke half the kingdom into the bargain; so he had now plenty to do, and people said they would have to search a long time to find his equal in wise and just ruling. Then one day Lars came to the duke, looking very little better than the first time he had seen him; but he was, of course, more humble, and did not dare giggle and make grimaces. 'You do not want my help any longer, now,' he said; 'for although I did wear out my shoes at first, I am now unable to wear out a single pair, and my feet will soon be covered all over with moss. So I thought I might now get my leave of absence,' he said. The duke quite agreed with him. 'I have tried to spare you, and I almost think I could do without you,' he said. 'But the palace and all the rest I do not want to lose, for such a clever builder as you I shall never get again; nor do I ever want to adorn the gallows again, as you can well understand; so I cannot give you back the paper on any account,' he said. 'Well, as long as you have got it, I need not fear,' said Lars; 'but if anybody else should get hold of it there will be nothing but running and trudging about again, and that's what I want to avoid; for when one has been tramping about for a thousand years, as I have done, one begins to get tired of it,' he said. But they went on talking, and at last they agreed that the duke should put the paper in the box, and then bury it seven ells under the ground, under a stone fixed in the earth. They then gave mutual thanks for the time they had spent in each other's company, and so they parted. The duke carried out his part of the agreement, for he was not likely to want to change it. He lived happy and contented with the princess, and they had both sons and daughters. When the king died, he got the whole of the kingdom, and you may guess he was none the worse off for that; and there no doubt he still lives and reigns, if he is not dead. But as for the box with the scrap of paper in it, there are many who are still running about looking for it.", "title": "Lars, My Lad!", "id": 624}
{"label": "175", "text": "There was a great drought in the land; and the lion called together a number of animals, so that they might devise a plan for retaining water when the rains fell. The animals which attended to the lion's summons were the baboon, the leopard, the hyena, the jackal, the hare, and the mountain tortoise. It was agreed that they should scratch a large hole m some suitable place to hold water; and the next day they all began to work, with the exception of the jackal, who continually hovered about in that locality, and was overheard to mutter that he was not going to scratch his nails off in making waterholes. When the dam was finished, the rains fell, and it was soon filled with water, to the great delight of those who had worked so hard at it. The first one, however, to come and drink there, was the jackal, who not only drank, but filled his clay pot with water, and then proceeded to swim in the rest of the water, making it as muddy and dirty as he could. This was brought to the knowledge of the lion, who was very angry, and ordered the baboon to guard the water the next day, armed with a huge knobkirrie. The baboon was concealed in a bush close to the water; but the jackal soon became aware of his presence there, and guessed its cause. Knowing the fondness of baboons for honey, the jackal at once hit upon a plan, and marching to and fro, every now and then dipped his lingers into his clay pot, and licked them with an expression of intense relish, saying, in a low voice, to himself, 'I don't want any of their dirty water, when I have a pot full of delicious honey.' This was too much for the poor baboon, whose mouth began to water. He soon began to beg the jackal to give him a little honey, as he had been watching for several hours, and was very hungry and tired. After taking no notice of the baboon at first, the jackal looked round, and said, in a patronizing manner, that he pitied such an unfortunate creature, and would give, him some honey, on certain conditions, viz., that the baboon should give up his knobkirrie and allow himself to be bound by the jackal. He foolishly agreed; and was soon tied in such a manner that he could not move hand or foot. The jackal now proceeded to drink of the water, to fill his pot, and to swim, in the sight of the baboon; from time to time telling him what a foolish fellow he had been to be so easily duped, and that he (the jackal) had no honey or anything else to give him, excepting a good blow on the head every now and then with his own knobkirrie. The animals soon appeared, and found the poor baboon in this sorry plight; looking the picture of misery. The lion was so exasperated that he caused the baboon to be severely punished, and to be denounced as a fool. The tortoise hereupon stepped forward, and offered his services for the capture of the jackal. It was at first thought that he was merely joking; but, when he explained in what manner he proposed to catch him, his plan was considered so feasible that his offer was accepted. He proposed that a thick coating of bijenwerk (a kind of sticky black substance found on bee-hives, i.e., bee-glue) should be spread fill over him, and that he should then go and stand at the entrance of the dam, on the water level, so that the jackal might tread upon him, and stick fast. This was accordingly done, and the tortoise posted there. The next day, when the jackal came, he approached the water very cautiously, and wondered to find no one there. He then ventured to the entrance of the water, and remarked how kind they had been in placing there a large black stepping-stone for him. As soon, however, as he trod upon the supposed stone, he stuck fast, and saw that he had been tricked; for the tortoise now put his head out, and began to move. The jackal's hind feet being still free, he threatened to smash the tortoise with them if he did not let him go. The tortoise merely answered, 'Do as you like.' The jackal thereupon made a violent jump, and found, with horror, that his hind foot were now also fast. 'Tortoise,' said he, ' I have still my mouth and teeth left, and will eat you alive, if you do not let me go,' 'Do as you like,' the tortoise again replied. The jackal, in his endeavors to free himself, at last made a desperate bite at the tortoise, and found himself fixed, both head and feet. The tortoise, feeling proud of his successful capture, now marched quietly up to the top of the bank with the jackal on his back, so that he could easily be seen by the animals as they came to the water. They were indeed astonished to find how cleverly the crafty jackal had been caught; and the tortoise was much praised, while the unhappy baboon was again reminded of his misconduct when set to guard the water. The jackal was at once condemned to death by the lion; and the hyena was to execute the sentence. The jackal pleaded hard for mercy, but, finding this useless, he made a last request to the lion (always, as he said, so fair and just in his dealings) that he should not have to suffer a lingering death. The lion inquired of him in what manner he wished to die; and he asked that his tail might be shaved and rubbed with a little fat, and that the hyena might then swing him round twice, and dash his brains out upon a stone. This, being considered sufficiently fair by the lion, was ordered by him to be carried out in his presence. When the jackal's tail had been shaved and greased, the hyena caught hold of him with great force, and before he had fairly lifted him from the ground, the cunning jackal had slipped away from the hyena's grasp, and was running for his life, pursued by all the animals. The lion was the foremost pursuer, and, after a great chase, the jackal got under an overhanging precipice, and, standing on his hind legs with his shoulders pressed against the rock, called loudly lo the lion to help him, as the rock was falling, and would crush them both. The lion put his shoulders to the rock, and exerted himself to the utmost. After some little time, the jackal proposed that he should creep slowly out, and fetch a large pole to prop up the rock, so that the lion could get out and save his life. The jackal did creep out, and left the lion there to starve, and die.", "title": "The Story of a Dam", "id": 625}
{"label": "613", "text": "After the death of the father the elder son said to the younger, 'Depart; I will not live with you any longer. Here are three hundred ducats and a horse: this is your portion of our father's property. Take it, for I owe you nothing more than this.' The younger son took the money and the horse which were offered him, and said, 'Thank God! See only how much of the kingdom has fallen to me!' Some time afterwards the two brothers, both of whom were riding, met by chance in a road. The younger brother greeted the elder one, saying, 'God help thee, brother!' And the elder answered, 'Why do you speak always about God? Nowadays injustice is better than justice.' The younger brother, however, said to him, 'I will wager with you that injustice is not, as you say, better than justice.' So they betted one hundred golden zechins, and it was arranged that they should leave the decision to the first man they met in the road. Riding together a little farther they met with Satan, who had disguised himself as a monk, and they asked him to decide which was better, justice or injustice? Satan answered, 'Injustice!' And the good brother paid the bad one the hundred golden zechins which he had wagered. Then they betted for another hundred zechins, and again a third time for a third hundred, and each time Satan -- who managed to disguise himself in different ways and meet them -- decided that injustice was better than justice. Thus the younger brother lost all his money, and his horse into the bargain. Then he said, 'Thank God! I have no more money, but I have eyes, and I wager my eyes that justice is better than injustice.' Thereupon the unjust brother, without waiting for any one's decision, drew his knife and cut both his brother's eyes out, saying, 'Now you have no eyes, let justice help you.' But the younger brother in his trouble only thanked God and said, 'I have lost my eyes for the sake of God's justice, but I pray you, my brother, give me a little water in some vessel to wash my wounds and wet my mouth, and bring me away from this place to the pine tree just about the spring, before you leave me.' The unjust brother did so, gave him water, and left him alone under the pine tree near the spring of water. There the unfortunate remained, sitting on the ground. Late, however, in the night, some fairies came to the spring to bathe, and one of them came to the spring to bathe, and one of them said to the others, 'Do you know, my sisters, that the king's daughter has got the leprosy? The king has summoned all the physicians, but no one can possibly help her. But if the king only knew, he would take a little of this water in which we are bathing, and wash his daughter therewith; and then in a day and a night she would recover completely from her leprosy. Just as any one deaf, or dumb, or blind, could be cured by this same water.' Then, as the cocks began to crow, the fairies hurried away. As soon as they were gone, the unfortunate man felt his way slowly with his outstretched hands till he came to the spring of water. There he bathed his eyes, and in an instant recovered his sight. After that he filled the vessel with water, and hurried away to the king, whose daughter was leprous, and said to the servants, 'I am come to cure the king's daughter, if he will only let me try. I guarantee that she will become healthy in a day and night.' When the king heard that, he ordered him to be led into the room where the girl was, and made her immediately bathe in the water. After a day and a night the girl came out pure and healthy. Then the king was greatly pleased, and gave the young prince the half of his kingdom, and also his daughter for a wife, so that he became the king's son-in-law, and the first man after him in the kingdom. The tidings of this great event spread all over the world, and so came to the ears of the unjust brother. He guessed directly that his blind brother must have met with good fortune under the pine tree, so he went himself to try to find it also. He carried with him a vessel full of water, and then carved out his own eyes with his knife. When it was dark the fairies came again, and, as they bathed, spoke about the recovery of the king's daughter. 'It cannot be otherwise,' they said; 'someone must have been listening to our last conversation here. Perhaps someone is listening now. Let us see.' So they searched all around, and when they came to the pine tree they found there the unjust brother who had come to seek after good fortune, and who declared always that injustice was better than justice. They immediately caught him, and tore him into four parts. And so, at the last, his wickedness did not help him, and he found to his cost that justice is better than injustice.", "title": "Justice or Injustice? Which Is Best?", "id": 626}
{"label": "545B", "text": "Tiring-tirang was a barrio in the town of Tang-Tang, situated at the foot of a hill which was called 'La Campana' because of its shape. Around the hill, about a mile from the barrio, flowed the Malogo River, in which the people of the town used to bathe. It so happened that one time an epidemic broke out in the community, killing off all the inhabitants except one couple. This couple had an only son named Juan Pusong Tambi-Tambi. When Juan had reached his twelfth year, his father died. Consequently the boy had to go to work to earn money for the support of himself and his mother. At first Juan followed the occupation of his father, that of fisherman; but, seeing that he made little money from this, he decided to become a farmer. His mother had now reached the age of seventy (!), and was often sick. Juan frequently had to neglect his farm in order to take care of her. One day Juan went to Pit-Pit to buy medicine for his mother. On his way to the town he saw a flock of crows eating up his corn. He paid no attention to the birds; but on his way back, when he saw these same birds still eating his corn, he became angry. He picked up a stone about the size of his fist, and crept into a bush near by. He had hardly hidden himself when the birds heard a rustling, and began to fly off. Juan jumped up, and hurled his stone with such accuracy and force that one of the crows fell dead to the ground. He tied the dead crow to a bamboo pole, and planted it in the middle of his corn field. No sooner was he out of sight than the crows flew back to the field again; but when they saw their dead companion, they flew off, and never troubled Juan again. For six months Juan had no trouble from birds. He did not know, however, that not far from his field there was a monkey (chongo) living in a large tree. This monkey used to come to his field every day and steal two or three ears of corn. One day, as Juan was walking across his field, he saw many dead cornstalks. He said to himself, 'I wonder who it is that comes here and steals my corn! I am no longer troubled by birds; and yet I find here many husks.' He went home and made an image of a crooked old man like himself. This he covered with sticky wax. He placed it in the middle of the field. The next morning, when the sun was shining very brightly, the monkey felt hungry, so he ran towards the field to steal some corn to eat. There he saw the statue. Thinking that it was Juan, he decided to ask permission before he took any corn. 'Good-morning, Juan!' said the monkey in a courteous tone; but the image made no reply. 'You are too proud to bend your neck, Juan,' continued the monkey. 'I have only come to ask you for three or four ears of corn. I have not eaten since yesterday, you know; and if you deny me this request, I shall die before morning.' The waxen statue still stood motionless. 'Do you hear me, Juan?' said the monkey impatiently. Still the statue made no reply. 'Since you are too proud to answer me, I will soon give you some presents. Look out!' he cried, and with his right paw he slapped the statue which he thought was Juan; but his paw stuck to the wax, and he could not get free. 'Let my hand loose!' the monkey shouted, 'or you will get another present.' Then he slapped the statue with his left paw, and, as before, stuck fast. 'You are foolish, Juan. If you do not let me go this very moment, I'll kick you.' He did so, first with one foot, and then with the other. At last he could no longer move, and he began to curse the statue. Juan, who had been hiding in a bush near by, now presented himself, and said to the monkey, 'Now I have caught you, you thief!' He would have killed the monkey at once, had not the monkey begged for mercy, and promised that he would at some future time repay him for his kindness if he would only spare his life. So Juan set the monkey free. It was now the month of April. The monkey, impatient to fulfil his word to Juan, went one day to the field, and there he found Juan hard at work. 'Good-morning, Master Juan!' he cried. 'I see that you are busy.' 'Busy indeed!' replied Juan. 'Master Juan, do you want to marry the king's daughter? If you do, I'll arrange everything for you,' said the monkey. Juan replied, 'Yes,' little thinking that what the monkey promised could be true. The monkey scampered off towards the market. When he entered the market, he saw a boy counting his money. The monkey pretended to be looking in the other direction, but walked towards the boy. When he saw that the money was fairly within his reach, he seized it and ran back to Juan. After telling his master what he had done, the monkey went to the king's palace, and said, 'Sir, my master, Juan, wants to borrow your ganta, for he desires to measure his money.' The king gave him the ganta. In three days the monkey appeared at the palace again to return the measure, in the bottom of which he stuck three centavos. 'My master, Juan, thanks you for your kindness,' said the monkey. The monkey was about to leave the room when the king perceived the three centavos sticking to the bottom of the measure. 'Here, monkey, here are your three cents!' said the king. 'Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!' answered the monkey, laughing, 'my master cares not for three cents. He has too much money. He is very, very rich.' The king was much surprised to hear that there was a man richer than himself. Two weeks later the monkey returned to the palace again, and said, 'Pray, king, my master, Juan, desires to borrow your ganta again. He wants to finish measuring his money.' The king was filled with curiosity; and he said, 'I'll let you borrow the ganta, monkey, but you must tell me first who is this Juan whom you call your master.' 'My master, Juan,' replied the monkey, 'is the richest man in the world.' Before giving the measure to the monkey, the king went to his room and stuck four pieces of gold on the four corners of the ganta. 'I'll find out who is the richer, Juan or I,' he said to himself. The monkey took the measure, and left the hall with a polite bow. As he was walking towards Juan's farm, the monkey noticed the four pieces of gold sticking to the corners of the ganta. He knew that they had been artfully placed there by the king himself. Two weeks later he went back to the palace to return the measure, not forgetting to stick a gold dollar on each corner. 'Good-afternoon, king!' said he, 'my master, Juan, returns you your ganta with a thousand thanks.' 'Very well,' replied the king; 'but tell me all about this master of yours who measures his money. I am a king; still I only count my money.' The monkey remained silent. Not receiving a prompt reply, the king turned to Cabal, one of his lords, and said in a whisper, 'Do you know who this Juan is who measures his money?' 'I have not heard of him,' replied the lord, 'except from this monkey and yourself.' The king then turned to the monkey, and said, 'Monkey, if you don't tell me who your master is, where he lives, and all about him, I'll hang you.' Doubtless the king was jealous of Juan because of his great wealth. Fearing that he would lose his life, the monkey said to the king, 'My master, Juan, the richest and best man in the world, lives in the town of XYZ. He goes to church every morning wearing his striped (tambi-tambi) clothes. This is why he is known among his people as Juan Pusong Tambi-Tambi. If you will just look out of your window tomorrow morning, you will see him pass by your garden.' The king's anger was appeased by this explanation. Early the next morning he was at his window, anxious to get a glimpse of Juan. He had not been there long when his attention was attracted by the appearance of a crooked man dressed in striped clothes. 'This must be the man whom the monkey described to me yesterday,' he said to himself. Soon his servant entered the room, and said, 'The monkey desires to see you.' The king left the window and went to where the monkey was waiting for him. As soon as the monkey saw the king, he bowed politely, and said, 'My master, Juan, sends me to tell you frankly that he loves your daughter, and that, if it pleases you, he will marry her.' At first the king was angry to hear these words; but, being very desirous to get more money, he at last consented without even asking his daughter. 'If my master does not call on you today, he will surely come tomorrow.' So saying, the monkey left the palace, and ran about town, trying to think of some way he might escape the great danger he was in. It so happened that an old man who was carrying a bundle of clothes to his son in the mountains passed along the same road where the monkey was. The sun was very hot, so the old man decided to rest under a leafy tree. No sooner was he seated there than the cunning monkey climbed the tree, and shook the branches with such force that twigs and fruits fell all around the old man. Panic-stricken, he ran away as fast as his feet would carry him, leaving everything behind him. When the man was out of sight, the monkey climbed down the tree, picked up the bundle of clothes, and carried it to Juan. 'Tomorrow, Juan,' said the monkey, 'you will marry the princess. I'll arrange everything for you if you will only follow my advice.' Half doubting and half believing, Juan asked the monkey if he really meant what he said. 'What do you think of me?' asked the monkey. Without waiting for a reply from Juan, the monkey left the hut, and ran towards the home of the Burincantadas who lived on the summit of the hill. As soon as he entered the gate, he began to scoop up the ground as fast as he could. The Burincantadas, who at that very moment were looking out of the window, saw the monkey. They rushed downstairs, and, half frightened, said to him, 'What are you trying to do?' 'Why, our king has been defeated in the war. The enemies have already taken possession of the crown. The princess is dead, and it is said that everybody will be killed before to morrow noon,' replied the monkey, his teeth chattering. 'I am resolved to hide myself under the ground to save my life.' The three Burincantadas seized him by the arm, and said, 'For mercy's sake, have pity on us! Tell us where we can hide!' They were already trembling with fear. 'Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! let me loose! The enemy are coming!' On hearing these words, the Burincantadas all shouted at once, 'Tell us where to hide!' 'If you will not let me scoop out a hole here, I'll jump into the well,' said the monkey in a hoarse voice. As soon as the Burincantadas heard the word 'well,' they all ran as fast as they could, following the monkey. 'Let me jump first!' said the monkey. 'No, let us jump first!' shouted the Burincantadas; and so they did. The monkey made a motion as if he were going to follow; but, instead, he lifted up the biggest stone he could find and threw it down the well. 'They are dead,' he said to himself, laughing. 'Ah, I have caught you! Ha, ha!' The Burincantadas now being dead, the monkey was at leisure to decide what to do next. He entered their palace, and there he found everything magnificent. 'This is the very place where my master shall live!' He opened the first room, but there he found nothing but bones. He closed the door and opened the second, where he found many prisoners who were waiting to be eaten. He set them all free, and told them to clean up the palace at once. The prisoners set to work, not forgetting to thank the monkey for his kindness. Before he left the palace, he addressed the crowd as follows: 'My brothers and sisters, if any one comes and asks you who your master is, tell him that he is Don Juan Pusong Tambi-Tambi.' Then he left the crowd of people busy cleaning the palace, and went to the farm, where he found thousands of horses, cows, and sheep. 'My master is indeed rich,' he said to himself. He called the shepherd who was lying under the tree, and said to him, 'Tell your other companions that, if any one comes and asks whose animals these are, they must answer that they all belong to Don Juan Pusong. Don Juan is your master now.' After seeing that everything was in order, the monkey hastened to his master, who was still ploughing, and said, 'Throw away your plough. Let's go to the king's palace, for tonight you will be married to the princess Do\u00c3\u00b1a Elena.' Night came. The palace was splendidly adorned. The princess was sitting by her father, when Don Juan, dressed in his striped clothes and accompanied by the monkey, entered the gate of the palace. Soon the priest came, and the princess was called to the reception-hall. When she saw her bridegroom, she ran away in despair, and cried to her father, 'Father, how dare you accept as my husband such a base, dirty, crooked man! Look at him! Why, he is the meanest of the mean.' But the king replied, 'He is rich. If you don't marry him, I'll punish you very severely.' The princess had to obey her father; but, before giving her hand to Juan Pusong, she said, 'O God! let me die.' When the marriage ceremony was over, the king called the monkey, and asked, 'Where is the couple going to live?' 'In Don Juan's palace,' was the reply of the monkey. The king immediately ordered carriages to be gotten ready. Then they started on their journey. Four hours passed, and still no palace was to be seen. The king became impatient, and said to the monkey, 'Monkey, if what you have said to me is not true, your head shall answer for your lie.' Hardly had he said these words when he beheld before him a number of men watching a herd of cattle. 'I wonder who owns these, monkey!' said the king. The monkey made some signs, and soon three shepherds came running up to them. 'Good-evening, king!' they said. 'Good-evening!' replied the king. 'Whose cattle are these?' 'They are all owned by Don Juan Pusong,' said the shepherds. The king nodded, and said to himself, 'He is truly rich.' The palace was now in sight. The king could hardly express his joy on seeing such a magnificent building. 'Why, it is not a palace: it is heaven itself,' he said. They were now upstairs. The king, on seeing still more beauties, said, 'I confess, I am not the richest man on earth.' Soon he died of joy, and his body was placed in a golden coffin and buried in the church. The couple inherited his dominion; but Queen Elena could not endure her ugly husband, and two weeks later she died broken-hearted. So Juan was left as sole ruler of two kingdoms. The monkey became his chief minister. This story shows that a compassionate man oftentimes gets his reward.", "title": "The Monkey and Juan Pusong Tambi-Tambi", "id": 627}

Then the oldest of them came forth and said: 'We can only turn to God and to the crab, the wisest of all water-dwellers.' The other fish all agreed, and they presented themselves before the crab, who was lying peacefully at the door of his nest. He knew nothing of the fishes' problem. The oldest of them approached him, and after greeting him, said: 'You need not concern yourself with our sad situation, o wise and learned crab.' The crab asked: 'Just what is your problem then?' They told him about the lack of water and of their approaching downfall, then asked him for advice and support. The crab was silent for a while, thinking: 'These simple fish have but little trust in God. But I shall set them at ease. God's will shall then transpire.' Then he said to the fish: 'Don't you fish know that the year has just begun. There is still plenty of water. It will rain again. Trust in God. Pray to him often, for he hears the prayers of his creatures. Let us wait until winter when it will rain as usual. If not we shall flee from this pond to wherever God leads us.'

He told her of the kings hardheartedness and asked for advise. Then the old woman taught him the magic that he would need to finish the castle. When the king saw the castle, he was amazed and angry, and now he commanded the blacksmith to dig a great moat around the new castle and to build four bridges over the moat, with a gate for each one, and all that within three days. The blacksmith, using the old woman's magic, completed this task in three days as well. The king was even more amazed and more angry, because now he did not know what kind of a difficult and impossible task he would be able to give the blacksmith in order to find an excuse to take his life. Finally the king, quite beside himself, declared, 'If you don't want to lose your life, you must make a himphamp for me in three days!' The smith did not even know what a himphamp was, so more desperate than ever, he walked away. Once again he found the old woman, who said to him, 'Make a chamber pot of iron and place it under your bed. Then hide, and when you see anyone touch it, just say hold fast quietly to yourself, and you will soon see a himphamp!' The blacksmith did what the old woman said. One evening the king came, as usual, to visit the blacksmiths wife, and the smith hid himself where he could watch. The lovers got undressed, and the wife got into bed. Before following her, the king had to use the pot. As soon as he touched the iron pot, the smith whispered, 'Hold fast,' and the king, wearing only his nightshirt, stuck to the pot. The wife jumped out of bed and tried to tear the pot loose, but as soon as she touched it, the smith whispered 'hold fast,' and she too became stuck. The king was enraged at this tomfoolery, and the smith's wife began to cry. Her maid heard the commotion and, half asleep and stark naked, came running to help them. But she too became stuck, just like the others. Then the smith stepped forward and drove all three from the house with an iron club. It was almost daytime, and the embarrassed maid picked up a bundle of hay and tried to cover her shame with it. A cow came by and wanted to get at the hay, but the smith said 'hold fast!' and it also became attached. Then a bull came by and mounted the cow, and the smith called out once more, 'Hold fast!' He drove them -- all stuck to the iron pot -- up one street and down another. The people were just beginning to stir, and they all laughed and jeered.

The boy being mischievously inclined, was in the habit of trying to frighten the girl in a variety of ways, till she became at last so accustomed to his tricks, that she ceased to care for anything whatever, putting down everything strange that she saw and heard to the boy's mischief. One washing-day, the girl was sent by her mother to fetch home the linen, which had been spread to dry in the churchyard. When she had nearly filled her basket, she happened to look up, and saw sitting on a tomb near her a figure dressed in white from head to foot, but was not the least alarmed, believing it to be the boy playing her, as usual, a trick. So she ran up to it, and pulling its cap off said, 'You shall not frighten me, this time.' Then when she had finished collecting the linen she went home. But, to her astonishment -- for he could not have reached home before her without her seeing him -- the boy was the first person who greeted her on her arrival at the cottage. Among the linen, too, when it was sorted, was found a moldy white cap, which appeared to be nobody's property, and which was half full of earth. The next morning the ghost (for it was a ghost that the girl had seen) was found sitting with no cap upon its head, upon the same tombstone as the evening before. And as nobody had the courage to address it, or knew in the least how to get rid of it, they sent into the neighboring village for advice. An old man declared that the only way to avoid some general calamity, was for the little girl to replace on the ghost's head the cap she had seized from it, in the presence of many people, all of whom were to be perfectly silent. So a crowd collected in the churchyard, and the little girl, going forward, half afraid, with the cap, placed it upon the ghost's head, saying, 'Are you satisfied now?' But the ghost, raising its hand, gave her a fearful blow, and said, 'Yes, but are you now satisfied?' The little girl fell down dead, and at the same instant the ghost sank into the grave upon which it had been sitting, and was no more seen.", "title": "White Cap", "id": 632}
{"label": "850", "text": "Once upon a time in a distant kingdom there was a simple peasant lad who herded swine in a forest next to the king's castle. One of his pigs was smarter than all the rest, and the swineherd taught him how to stand on his hind legs and dance. A swineherd does get lonely, as you must know, alone in the woods with only his animals for company, and he must have been very pleased with himself that he had taught a pig to dance. One warm summer's day the princess was out walking in the shady woods, and she came upon the swineherd, just as his pig had finished dancing a jig. 'Oh, please make him dance once again,' asked the princess, ever so courteously, for she had never before seen a pig dance. 'Only if you will lift your skirts to your knees,' answered the swineherd. The princess could see no harm in this, so she lifted her skirts to her knees, and sure enough, the swineherd's pig danced a merry jig. 'That was too short,' said the princess. 'Can't he dance some more?' 'Only if you lift your skirts to your waist,' said the swineherd. The princess hesitated, but again she could see no harm in his request, so she lifted her skirts to her waist, and the pig danced another merry jig. She still had not had enough and asked, again ever so politely, if the pig couldn't dance just one more time. It was such a cheerful thing to see! 'Only if you lift your skirts to your neck,' said the swineherd. 'To my neck?' she asked. 'To your neck!' he replied. Now not even a princess can see a dancing pig every day, so she lifted her skirts to her neck, and the swineherd's pig danced his very best. Some time later the king decided that it was time for the princess to marry, and because she was the most beautiful maiden in all the land, suitors came from near and far. The king could not choose from the many princes and noblemen who came courting his daughter. Finally he decreed that to win the princess's hand in marriage a suitor would have to describe her secret birthmark. You see, from the day the princess was born she had had a birthmark on her belly, a dainty little spot from which grew three fine golden hairs. The swineherd soon learned of the proclamation, and went to the castle at once, because, of course, he had seen the mark with the three golden hairs on the day that the princess had lifted her skirts in order to make his pig dance. Now a king's word is a king's word, and even though he did not relish giving his daughter to a simple swineherd, he had to do as he had promised. After all, the swineherd was able to describe the birthmark ever so correctly, down to the last golden hair. But the story is not yet done, for one of the princes who had come to court the princess offered the princess's lady-in-waiting a bag of gold if she would just describe to him her mistress's birthmark. The faithless servant took the gold and told the unworthy prince what he wanted to know. When the deceitful prince presented himself to the king and described the princess's birthmark ever so accurately, the king, at first, did not know what to do. But then he struck upon a plan. 'Let the princess decide herself!' he proclaimed. She and the two suitors shall spend the night together in the princess's bed. At sunrise I will look in on them, and the one she is facing shall be her husband. When the swineherd learned of the king's decree, he made plans for the night. First he put a large clump of chocolate (some say that it was marzipan) into his pocket. Then he secretly dropped an herb into the false prince's evening soup, an herb that would summon nature's call quickly and surely. That night the swineherd, the deceitful prince, and the beautiful princess all lay down in her large bed; the king locked the door behind them; and they closed their eyes. Then suddenly the false prince jumped up with a start and ran to the door, but it was locked. 'I have to also!' said the swineherd, jumping out of bed. 'What can we do? We're locked in!' cried the prince. 'We'll have to do it on the floor.' said the swineherd. Then each man deposited something on the floor: the swineherd his clump of chocolate, and the prince --, well, some things are better left unsaid. 'Now we are in trouble!' said the swineherd. 'When the king discovers what we've done, he'll have us killed!' 'What can we do?' asked the terrified prince. 'We've no choice,' answered the swineherd. 'We'll have to eat it.' Thus the swineherd ate his clump of chocolate, and the false prince ate ----, well, again, some things are better left unsaid. They returned to the sleeping princess's bed, one on one side of her and one on the other. With time the princess turned toward the prince and breathed in deeply, but then she gasped and quickly turned the other way. At sunrise the king looked in on them and found the princess contentedly asleep with her face nearly touching that of the swineherd. And that is how a simple swineherd came to marry a princess.", "title": "The Swineherd Who Married a Princess", "id": 633}

{"label": "613", "text": "There was once upon a time a huntsman, who had a son, who was also a huntsman. He sent his son into a foreign land, to look about him and learn something additional. Here he went into a tavern, where he found a stranger, with whom he entered into conversation. They told each other all the news, till they also began to talk about right and wrong. The stranger asserted that the greatest wrong could be made right for money. But the huntsman opined that right always remained right, and offered to bet three hundred dollars upon it, if the stranger would do the same. [Footnote: This surely ought, from what transpires later in the story, to have run thus: 'To stake his life against three hundred dollars to be staked by the stranger.'] The stranger was content therewith, and they agreed to ask three advocates the question at once. They went to the first advocate, and he said that it was possible to make wrong right for money. They then went to another. He also asserted that wrong could be made right for money. Finally, they went to a third. He also told them that wrong could be made right for money. They then went back again, and as they had been going about the whole day, it wasn't till late in the evening that they got to their tavern. The stranger then asked the huntsman whether he still disbelieved that the greatest wrong could be made right for money, and the huntsman replied that he should soon be obliged to believe it on the assertion of the three advocates, although he was very unwilling to do so. The stranger was willing to grant him his life if he consented to pay three hundred dollars; but as they were talking about it, in came a man who over-persuaded the stranger that he must needs abide by what they had previously agreed upon. He did not, however, do this, but only, with a red-hot iron, took his eyesight from him, and told him at the same time, that he would then and then only believe that right remained right in the world, when the huntsman regained his sight. The huntsman entreated the host of the tavern to put him on the right road to the town. He put him on the road to the gallows, and went his way. When the huntsman had gone a little further, there was the end of the road, and he heard it strike eleven. He couldn't go any further, and remained lying where he was in hope that perhaps somebody would come there in the morning. After a short time he heard a clatter, and soon somebody came up; nor was it long before a second and a third arrived. These were three evil spirits, who quitted their bodies in the night time, and perpetrated all manner of villainy in the world. They began to talk together, and one said, 'Today it is a year and a day since we were here together and related the good deeds that we had done during the year before. A year has again elapsed, and it is therefore time that we should ascertain which of us has done the best action during the past year.' The first spoke, and said, 'I have deprived the inhabitants of the city of Ramul of their water supply; they can only be helped if somebody finds out what it is that stops up the spring.' 'What's that?' said the second; and the first replied, 'I have placed a great toad on the spring out of which the water at other times flowed; if that be removed, the water will spring up again as before.' The second said, 'I have caused the beauty of the princess of Sarahawsky to disappear, and herself to fade away to skin and bones; she cannot be helped until the silver nail, which hangs above her bed, be pulled out.' The third said, 'Yesterday I caused a person to be deprived of his eyesight with a red hot iron; he can only be helped by washing his eyes with the water that is in the well not far from this gallows.' It then struck twelve in the town, and the three disappeared at once, but the huntsman remembered all that he had heard, and rejoiced that it was in his power to regain his eyesight. Early on the morrow he heard somebody passing by, and begged him to send him people from the town, to tell where the healing spring was. Then all manner of people came to him, but no one could show him the spring, save at length one old woman. He caused himself to be led thither, and as soon as he had washed his eyes in it, he immediately obtained his eyesight again. He now asked the way to the city of Ramul, and went thither. As soon as he arrived, he told the town council that he would restore them their water. But plenty of people had been there already, and the city had spent a great deal of money upon them, yet no one had effected aught, so, as it had been all in vain, they intended to have nothing more to do with the matter. Well, he said that he would do it all for nothing, only they must give him some laborers to help him. It was done. When they had dug as far as the place where the pipes, through which the water used to flow, were laid into the spring, he sent all the workmen away and dug a little further himself, and behold! a toad, like a boiler, was sitting on the spring. He removed it, and immediately the water began to flow, and ere long all the fountains were filled with water. The citizens got up a grand banquet in his honor, and paid him a large sum of money for what he had done. He then went on and came to Sarahawsky. Then in a short time he learnt that the princess was ill, just as he had heard, and that no physician was able to help her; moreover that the king had promised that the person who could cure her malady should obtain her to wife. He therefore equipped himself very handsomely, went to the king's palace, and there declared that he had come from a far country, and would cure the princess. The king replied to him that he had scarce any hope left, but would nevertheless make the experiment with him. The huntsman said that he would fetch his medicine. He went out and bought all manner of sweet comfits, and then went to the princess. He gave her a first dose, and looked about to see in what part of her bed's head the silver nail was sticking. Early on the second day he came again, gave her again some of his medicine, took the opportunity of laying hold of the nail, and pulled it till it began to move. In the afternoon the princess felt that she was better. The third day he came again, and while the princess was taking the medicine, pulled again at the bed's head, pulled the nail clean out, and put it secretly into his pocket. At noon the princess was so far recovered, that she wanted to have her dinner, and the king invited the huntsman to a grand banquet. They settled when the wedding was to take place, but the huntsman considered that he must first go home. And when he had got home, he went again to the tavern where he had lost the sight of his eyes, and the stranger was there also. They began to tell each other all the news, and the huntsman related what he had heard under the gallows; how he had discovered the water, and finally how he had regained the sight of his eyes, and said that the stranger must now believe that in the world right always remained right. The stranger marveled exceedingly, and said that he would believe it. After this the huntsman went on and came to his princess, and they had a grand wedding festival, which lasted a whole week. The stranger bethought himself that he, too, would go under the gallows; peradventure he might also hear some such things as the huntsman had heard, and might in consequence also obtain a princess to wife. And when the year had elapsed, he also went there. He heard it strike one, and in a short time he heard a clatter; then up came somebody again, and it wasn't long before a second and third arrived. They began to talk together, and one said, 'It cannot but be, that some one overheard us last year, and through that everything that we have done is ruined. Let us, therefore, make a careful search before we again recount to each other what we have done.' They immediately began to search, and found the stranger. They tore him into three pieces and hung them up on the three corners of the gallows. When the old king died they took the huntsman for king, and if he has not died, he is reigning still at the present day, and firmly believes that in his realm right will always remain right.", "title": "Right Always Remains Right", "id": 635}

With this Resolution, they found an Outlet where a Pale had been broken down; and, bolting forth upon an adjoining Common, had not run far before their Course was stopt by that of a gentle Brook which glided across the way they intended to take. This was so grievous a Disappointment, that they were not able to bear it, and they deterinin'd rather to throw themselves headlong into the Water, let what would become of it, than lead a Life so full of Dangers and Crosses. But upon their coming to the brink of the River, a Parcel of Frogs, which were fitting there, frighted at their Approach, leapt into the Stream in great Confusion, and dived to the very Bottom for Fear. Which a cunning old Puss observing, call'd to the rest and said, 'Hold, have a care what ye do: here are other Creatures, I perceive, which have their Fears as well as us: Don't then let us fancy ourselves the most miserable of any upon Earth; but rather, by their Example, learn to bear patiently those Inconveniencies which our Nature has thrown upon us.' The Application This Fable is design'd to shew us how unreasonable many People are, for living in such continual Fears and Disquiets about the Miserableness of their Condition. There is hardly any State of Life great enough to satisfy the Wishes of an ambitious Man; and scarce any so mean, but may supply all the Necessities of him that is moderate. But if People will be so unwise as to work themselves up to imaginary Misfortunes, why do they grumble at Nature and their Stars, when their own perverse Minds are only to blame? If we are to conclude ourselves unhappy by as many Degrees as there are others greater than we, why then the greatest Part of Mankind must be miserable, in some degree at least. But, if they who repine at their own afflicted Condition, would but reckon up how many more there are with whom they would not change Cases, than whose Pleasures they envy, they would certainly rise up better satisfied from such a Calculation. But what shall we say to those who have a way of creating themselves Panics from the rustling of the Wind, the scratching of a Rat or Mouse, behind the Hangings, the fluttering of a Moth, or the Motion of their own Shadow by Moonlight? Their whole Life is as full of Alarms as that of a Hare, and they never think themselves so happy as when, like the timorous Folks in the Fable, they meet with a Set of Creatures as fearful as themselves.", "title": "The Hares and the Frogs (Croxall)", "id": 636}

She called out, 'Help me, Hedgehog! I'm caught in a trap.' He said, 'Empty the tricks out of your bag, so I can free you.' The fox said, 'I jumped over a ditch, and all my tricks fell out.

The fox did what the hedgehog had advised, and when the farmer came by, he thought that the fox was already stinky rotten and threw her out of the vineyard. Thus she escaped.

{"label": "451", "text": "There was once a woman who had nine sons. They were good boys and loved her dearly but there was one thing about which they were always complaining. 'Why haven't we a little sister?' they kept asking. 'Do give us a little sister!' When the time came that another child was to be born, they said to their mother, 'If the baby is a boy we are going away and you will never see us again, but if it is a little girl then we shall stay home and take care of it.' The mother agreed that if the child were a girl she would have her husband put a spindle outside on the gatepost and, if it were a boy, an ax. 'Just wait,' she said, 'and see what your father puts on the gatepost and then you will know whether it is another brother God has sent you or a little sister.' The baby turned out to be a girl and the mother was overjoyed. 'Hurry, husband!' she cried, 'and put a spindle on the gatepost so that our nine sons may know the good news!' The man did so and then quickly returned to the mother and baby. The moment he was gone Suyettar slipped up and changed the tokens. She took away the spindle and put in its place an ax. Then with an evil grin she hurried off mumbling to herself, 'Now we'll see what we'll see!' She hoped to bring trouble and grief and she succeeded. As soon as the nine sons saw the ax on the gatepost they thought their mother had given birth to another son and at once they left home vowing never to return. The poor mother waited for them and waited. 'What is keeping my sons?' she cried at last. 'Go out to the gate, husband, and see if they are coming.' The man went out and soon returned bringing back word that someone had changed the tokens. 'The spindle that I put on the gatepost is gone,' he said, 'and in its place is an ax.' 'Alas!' cried the poor mother, 'some evil creature has done this to spite us! Oh, if we could only get word to our sons of the little sister they were so eager to have!' But there was no way to reach them for no one knew the way they had gone. In a short time the husband died and the poor woman, abandoned by her nine sons, had only her little daughter left. She named the child Kerttu. Kerttu was a dear little girl and her face was as beautiful as her heart was good. Whenever she found her mother weeping alone she tried to comfort her and, as she grew older, she wanted to know the cause of her mother's grief. At last the mother told her about her nine brothers and how they had gone away never to return owing to the trick of some evil creature. 'My poor mother!' she cried, 'how sorry I am that I am the innocent cause of your loss! Let me go out into the world and find my brothers! When once they hear the truth they will gladly come home to you to care for you in your old age!' At first the mother would not consent to this. 'You are all I have,' she said, 'and I should indeed be miserable and lonely if anything happened you!' But Kerttu continued to weep every time she thought of her poor brothers driven unnecessarily from home and at last the mother, realizing that she would nevermore be happy unless she were allowed to go in search of them, gave up opposing her. 'Very well, my daughter, you may go and may God go with you and bring you safely back to me. But before you go I must prepare you a bag of food for the journey and bake you a magic cake that will show you the way.' So she baked a batch of bread and at the same time mixed a little round cake with Kerttu's own tears and baked it, too. Then she said, 'Here now, my child, are provisions for the journey and here is a magic cake that will lead you to your brothers. All you have to do is throw it down in front of you and say: Roll, roll, my little cake! Show me the way that I must take To find at last the brothers nine Whose own true mother is also mine! Then the little cake will start rolling and do you follow wherever it rolls. But, Kerttu, my child, you must not start out alone. You must have some friend or companion to go with you.' Now it happened that Kerttu had a little dog, Musti, that she loved dearly. 'I'll take Musti with me!' she said. 'Musti will protect me!' So she called Musti and Musti wagged his tail and barked with joy at the prospect of going out into the world with his mistress. Then Kerttu threw down the magic cake in front of her and sang: At once the cake rolled off like a little wheel and Kerttu and Musti followed it. They walked until they were tired. Then Kerttu picked up the little cake and they rested by the wayside. When they were ready again to start the cake a-rolling, all Kerttu had to do was throw it down in front of her and say the magic rhyme. Their first day was without adventure. When night came they ate their supper and went to sleep in a field under a tree. The second day they overtook an ugly old woman whom Kerttu disliked on sight. But she said to herself, 'Shame on you, Kerttu, not liking this woman just because she's old and ugly!' and she made herself answer the old woman's greetings politely, and she made Musti stop snarling and growling. The old hag asked Kerttu who she was and where she was going and Kerttu told her. 'Ah!' said the old woman, 'how fortunate that we have met each other for our ways lie together!' She smiled and petted Kerttu's arm and Kerttu felt like shuddering. But she restrained herself and told herself severely, 'You're a wicked girl not to feel more friendly to the poor old thing!' Musti felt much as Kerttu did. He no longer growled for Kerttu had told him not to, but he drooped his tail between his legs and, pressing up close to Kerttu, he trembled with fright. And well he might, too, for the old hag was none other than Suyettar who had been waiting all these years just for this very chance to do further injury to Kerttu and her brothers. Kerttu, poor child, was, alas! too good and innocent to suspect evil in others. She said to Suyettar, 'Very well, if our ways lie together then we can be companions.' So Suyettar joined Kerttu and Musti and the three of them walked on following the little cake. As the day advanced the sun grew hotter and hotter and at last when they reached a lake Suyettar said, 'My dear, let us sit down here for a few moments and rest.' They all sat down and presently Suyettar said, 'Let us go bathing in the lake. That will refresh us.' Kerttu would have agreed if Musti had not tugged at her skirts and warned her not to. 'Don't do it, dear mistress!' Musti growled softly. 'Don't go in bathing with her! She'll bewitch you!' So Kerttu said, 'No, I don't want to go in bathing.' Suyettar waited until they were again journeying on and then when Kerttu wasn't looking she turned around and kicked Musti and broke one of the poor little dog's legs. Thereafter Musti had to hop along on three legs. The next afternoon when they passed another lake, Suyettar tried again to tempt Kerttu into the water. 'The sun is very hot,' she said, 'and it would refresh us both to bathe. Come, Kerttu, my dear, don't refuse me this time!' But again Musti tugged at Kerttu's skirts and, licking her hand, whispered the warning, 'Don't do it, dear mistress! Don't go in bathing with her or she will bewitch you!' So again Kerttu said politely, 'No, I don't feel like going in bathing. You go in alone and I'll wait for you here.' But this was not what Suyettar wanted and she said, no, she didn't care to go in alone. She was furious, too, with Musti and later when Kerttu wasn't looking she gave the poor little dog a kick that broke another leg. Thereafter Musti had to hop along on two legs. They slept the third night by the wayside and the next day they went on again always following the magic cake. In midafternoon they passed a lake and Suyettar said: 'Surely, my dear, you must be tired and hot. Let us both bathe in this cool lake.' But Musti, hopping painfully along on two legs, yelped weakly and said to Kerttu, 'Don't do it, dear mistress! Don't go in bathing with her or she'll bewitch you!' So for a third time Kerttu refused and later, when she wasn't looking, Suyettar kicked Musti and broke the third of the poor little dog's legs. Thereafter Musti hopped on as best he could on only one leg, Well, they went on and on. When night came they slept by the roadside and then next morning they started on again. The sun grew hot and by midafternoon Kerttu was tired and ready to rest. When they reached a lake Suyettar again begged that they both go in bathing. Kerttu was tempted to agree when poor Musti threw himself panting at her feet and whimpered, 'Don't do it, dear mistress! Don't go in bathing with her or she will bewitch you!' So Kerttu again refused. 'That's right, dear mistress!' Musti panted, 'don't do it! I shall soon be dead, I know, for she hates me, but before I die I want to warn you one last time never to go in bathing with her or she will bewitch you!' 'What's that dog saying?' Suyettar demanded angrily, and without waiting for an answer she picked up a heavy piece of wood and struck poor Musti such a blow on the head that it killed him. 'What have you done to my poor little dog?' Kerttu cried. 'Don't mind him, my dear,' Suyettar said. 'He was sick and lame and it was better to put him out of his misery.' Suyettar tried to soothe Kerttu and make her forget Musti but all afternoon Kerttu wept to think that she would never again see her faithful little friend. The next afternoon when Suyettar begged her to go in bathing there was no Musti to warn her against it and at last Kerttu allowed herself to be persuaded. She was tired from her many days' wandering and it was true that the first touch of the cool water refreshed her. 'Now splash water in my face!' Suyettar cried. But Kerttu didn't want to splash water into Suyettar's face for she supposed Suyettar was an old woman and she thought it would be disrespectful to splash water into the face of an old woman. 'Do you hear me!' screamed Suyettar. When Kerttu still hesitated, Suyettar looked at her with such a terrible, threatening expression that Kerttu did as she was bidden. She splashed water into Suyettar's face and, as the water touched Suyettar's eyes, Suyettar cried out: Your bonny looks give up to me And you take mine for all to see! Instantly they two changed appearance: Suyettar looked young and beautiful like Kerttu, and Kerttu was changed to a hideous old hag. Then too late she realized that the awful old woman to whom she had been so polite was Suyettar. 'Oh, why,' Kerttu cried, 'why didn't I heed poor Musti's warning!' Suyettar dragged her roughly out of the water. 'Come along!' she said. 'Dress yourself in those rags of mine and start that cake a-rolling! We ought to reach your brothers' house by tonight.' So poor Kerttu had to dress herself in Suyettar's filthy old garments while Suyettar, looking like a fresh young girl, decked herself out in Kerttu's pretty bodice and skirt. Unwillingly now and with a heavy heart Kerttu threw down the cake and said: Off rolled the little cake and they two followed it, Kerttu weeping bitterly and Suyettar taunting her with ugly laughs. Then suddenly Kerttu forgot to weep for Suyettar took from her her memory and her tongue. The little cake led them at last to a farmhouse before which it stopped. This was where the nine brothers were living. Eight of them were out working in the fields but the youngest was at home. He opened the door and when Suyettar told him that she was Kerttu, his sister, he kissed her tenderly and made her welcome. Then he invited her inside and they sat side by side on the bench and talked and Suyettar told him all she had heard from Kerttu about his mother and about the tokens which had been changed at Kerttu's birth. The youngest brother listened eagerly and Suyettar told her story so glibly that of course he supposed that she was his own true sister. 'And who is the awful looking old hag that has come with you?' he asked pointing at Kerttu. 'That? Oh, that's an old serving woman whom our mother sent with me to bear me company. She's dumb and foolish but she's a good herd and we can let her drive the cow out to pasture every day.' The older brothers when they came home were greatly pleased to find what they thought was their sister. They began to love her at once and to pet her and they said that now she must stay with them and keep house for them. She told them that was what she wanted to do and she said that now she was here the youngest brother need no longer stay at home but could go out every morning with the rest of them to work in the fields. So now began a new life for poor Kerttu. In the morning after the brothers were gone Suyettar would scold and abuse her. She would bake a cake for her dinner to be eaten in the fields and she would fill the cake with stones and sticks and filth. Then she would take Kerttu as far as the gate where she would give her back her tongue and her memory and order her roughly to drive the cow to pasture and look after it all day long. In the late afternoon when Kerttu drove home the cow, Suyettar would meet her at the gate and take from her her tongue and her memory and then in the evening the brothers would see her as a foolish old woman who couldn't talk. Every morning and every evening Kerttu begged Suyettar to show her a little mercy, but far from showing her any mercy Suyettar grew more cruel from day to day. Suyettar was very proud to think that nine handsome young men took her for a beautiful girl and she felt sure they would never find out their mistake for only Kerttu knew who she really was and Kerttu was entirely in her power. At night seated in the shadow in a far corner of the kitchen with her nine brothers laughing and talking Kerttu felt no sorrow for at such times of course she had no memory. But during the day it was different. Then when she was alone in the meadow she had her memory and her tongue and she thought about her poor mother at home anxiously awaiting her return and she thought of her nine sturdy brothers all of whom might now through her mistake fall victims to Suyettar. These thoughts made her weep with grief and as the days went by she put this grief into a song which she sang constantly: I've found at last the brothers nine Whose own true mother is also mine, But they know me not from stick or stone! They leave me here to weep alone, While Suyettar sits in my place With stolen looks and stolen face! She snared me first with evil guile And now she mocks me all the while: By night she takes my tongue away, She feeds me sticks and stones by day! . . . Oh, little they guess, the brothers nine, That their own true mother is also mine! The brothers as they worked in nearby fields used to hear the song and they wondered about it. 'Strange!' they said to one another. 'Can that be the old woman singing? In the evening at home she never opens her mouth and our dear sister always says that she's dumb and foolish.' One afternoon when Kerttu's song sounded particularly sad, the youngest brother, crept close to the meadow where Kerttu was sitting in order to hear the words. He listened carefully and then hurried back to the others and with frightened face told them what he had heard. 'Nonsense I' the older brothers said. 'It can't be so!' However, they, too, wanted to hear for themselves the words of the strange song, so they all crept near to listen. It looked like an old hag who was singing but the voice that came out of the withered mouth was the voice of a young girl. As they listened they, too, grew pale: 'Can it be true?' they said, whispering together. They sent the youngest brother to question Kerttu, and he, when he had heard her story, believed it true. Then the other brothers went to her one by one and questioned her and finally they were all convinced of the truth of her story. 'It is well for us,' they said, 'if we do not all fall into the power of that awful creature! How, O how can we rescue our poor little sister!' 'I can never get back my own looks,' Kerttu said, 'unless Suyettar splashes water into my eyes and unless I cry out a magic rhyme as she does it.' The brothers discussed one plan after another and at last agreed on one that they thought might deceive Suyettar. They had Kerttu inflame her eyes with dust and come groping home one midday. The brothers, too, were at home and as Kerttu came stumbling into the kitchen they said to Suyettar, 'Oh, sister, sister, see the poor old woman! Something ails her! Her eyes -- they're all red and swollen! Get some water and bathe them!' 'Nonsense!' Suyettar said. 'The old hag's well enough! Let her be! She doesn't need any attention!' 'Oh, sister!' the youngest brother said, reproachfully, 'is that any way for a human, kindhearted girl like you to talk? If you won't bathe the old creature's eyes, I will myself!' Then Suyettar who of course wanted them to think that she was a human, kindhearted girl said, no, she would bathe them. So she took a basin of water over to Kerttu and told her to lean down her head. As she splashed the first drop of water into Kerttu's eyes, Kerttu cried out: 'My own true looks give back to me And take your own for all to see! Instantly Suyettar was again a hideous old hag though still dressed in Kerttu's pretty bodice and skirt, and Kerttu was herself again, young and fresh and sweet, though still incased in Suyettar's rags. But the brothers pretended that they saw no difference and kept on talking to Suyettar as though they still thought her Kerttu. And Suyettar because her eyes were blinded with the dust supposed that they were still deceived. Then one of the brothers said to Suyettar, 'Sister dear, the sauna is all heated and ready. Don't you want to bathe?' Suyettar thought that this would be a fine chance to wash the dust from her eyes, so she let them lead her to the sauna. Once they got her inside they locked the door and set the sauna afire. Oh, the noise she made then when she found she had been trapped! She kicked and screamed and cursed and threatened! But Kerttu and the brothers paid no heed to her. They left her burning in the sauna while they hurried homewards. They found their poor old mother seated at the window weeping, for she thought that now Kerttu as well as her sons was lost forever. As Kerttu and the nine handsome young men came in the gate she didn't recognize them until Kerttu sang out: I bring at last the brothers nine Then she knew who they were and with thanks to God she welcomed them home.", "title": "The Little Sister: The Story of Suyettar and the Nine Brothers", "id": 639}
{"label": "850", "text": "There was once, I don't know where, an old petticoat a hundred years old, and in this petticoat a tuck, in which I found the following story. There was once a king who had seven sons and seven daughters. He was in great trouble where to find princesses of royal blood as wives for his sons and princes as husbands for his daughters. At last the idea struck him that the seven sons should marry the seven daughters. They all consented to their father's wish with the exception of the youngest son and daughter. 'Well, if you won't,' said the father, 'I will give you your inheritance and you can go and try your fortune, and get married as best you can.' The two children went, and came to a strange land, where they were overtaken by darkness in a wood. They chose a bushy tree for their resting place, whose leafy boughs bent down to the ground and afforded shelter. When they woke next morning, the girl told her brother that she had dreamt that there was a town not far off, where a king lived who had been ill for a long time, and thousands upon thousands of doctors had failed to cure him. He again dreamt that an old man with snow-white hair told him that the tree under which they slept gave water. In this water the king was to be bathed, and he would be cured. They at once examined the tree, and from a crack in the bark sap as clear as crystal was dripping; they filled their flasks with the fluid and continued their journey. When they reached the outskirts of the forest, they saw a town in front of them. Having arrived there they went into an inn to find out whether their dream was true, and asked the host what the news was in the town; he, in his conversation, mentioned the illness of the king, and the many unsuccessful attempts of men to cure him, and that he had strict orders, under a heavy penalty, to report at once every doctor that came to his inn. 'I also am a doctor,' said the prince, 'and this youth is my assistant,' he continued, pointing to his sister, who was dressed in male attire. The innkeeper at once reported them, and they went to court to try their remedy on the king. The king's body was covered with sores, and the doctor bathed his hand with the juice of the tree. To his great joy, the king discovered next morning that the place which had been bathed was visibly improving; he therefore, the very same night, sent a huge wooden vessel on a cart to the tree, to bring him sufficient water for a bath. After a few baths the king actually recovered; and the doctor, having received a handsome present, requested a favor of the king, viz., to pay him a visit and to do him the honor of dining with him. The king cordially granted the request, and the prince received him with great splendor in his spacious apartments, which were decorated with a lavishness becoming a sovereign. As the king found the doctor alone, he inquired after his assistant, and at this moment a charming pretty girl stepped from one of the side rooms, whom the king at once recognized as the doctor's assistant. The strangers now related to him their story, and the king became more affable, especially towards the pretty assistant, who at once gained possession of his heart and soul, and the short acquaintance ended with a wedding. The prince, not forgetting the object of his journey, started soon after the wedding festivities were over. He passed on till he came to the boundary of the king's realm, and then went on as far as the capital of the next country. He was riding about the streets on a fine horse, when he heard a voice coming from a window close by, 'Hum, you, too, won't get on without me,' and looking in the direction from which the voice came, he discovered an old man looking out of the window. He didn't take any notice of the voice, but went on; and, having arrived at an inn, made sundry inquiries, when he was told that adventurous young men in this town might either meet with great fortune or with a great misfortune; because the king had a daughter whom no one had as yet seen, with the exception of her old nurse. The girl had three marks on her, and whoever found out what they were, and where they were, would become her husband; but whosoever undertook the task and failed, would be impaled, and that already ninety-nine young fellows had died in this manner. Upon hearing this, it became clear to the prince what the meaning of the old man's saying was; he thought, that no doubt the old man took him for another adventurer, and the thought struck him that the old man must be acquainted with the secret, and that it would be advantageous to make his acquaintance. He found a plea at once; the old man was a goldsmith, and, as the prince had lost the rowel of his golden spur on the road, he called on him, and, having come to terms about the spur, the prince inquired of him about the princess, and the old man's tale tallied with that of the innkeeper. After a short reflection, the prince told the old man who he was, and, with a look full of meaning, inquired if the goldsmith could help him in case he tried his luck. 'For a good sum with pleasure,' replied the goldsmith. 'You shall have it,' said the prince; 'but tell me how, and I will give you this purse on account.' The old man, seeing that there was good opportunity for gain, said, 'I will construct a silver horse in which you can conceal yourself, and I will expose it for sale in the market. I am almost sure that no one will buy it but someone attached to the royal court, and if once you get in there, you can get out of the horse by a secret opening and go back whenever you like and, I think, you will succeed.' And so it happened; on the following market day a splendid silver horse was exhibited in the vicinity of the royal palace. There were a good many admirers, but on account of the great price there was no buyer, till at last a person belonging to the royal court enquired the price; after a few moments he returned and bought the horse for the king, who presented it to his daughter, and thus the prince managed to get into the chamber of the princess, which was the most difficult of all things, and he listened amidst fear and joy to the silvery voice of the pretty girl, who amused herself with the horse -- which ran on wheels -- and called it her dear pet. Evening drew on, and the mysterious girl went to rest; everything became quiet, and only her old nurse was sitting up not far from her bed; but about midnight she, too, fell asleep. Hearing that she was fast asleep, the prince got out of the horse and approached the girl's bed, holding his breath, and found the mark of the sun shining on the girl's forehead, the moon on the right breast, and three stars on the left. Having found out the three secret marks, the prince was about to retire to his hiding place when the princess woke. She tried to scream, but at an imploring gesture of the youth she kept silence. The girl could not take her eyes off the handsome prince, who related to her how and for what reason he had dared to come. The girl, being tired of her long seclusion, consented to his scheme, and they secretly plotted how the prince should get out of the palace; whereupon he went back to his hiding place. In accord with the plot, next morning the girl broke one of the horse's ears off, and it was sent back to the goldsmith's to be repaired, and the prince was thus able to leave his dangerous position. Having again splendidly remunerated the goldsmith, he returned to his new brother-in-law, so that he might come back with a splendid suite and royal pomp, and appear as a king to try his fortune. The prince returned with many magnificently clad knights and splendid horses, and reported himself to the king, and informed him by message that he was anxious to try his luck for the possession of his daughter. The king was very much pleased with the appearance of the youth, and therefore kindly admonished him not to risk his life, but the prince seemed quite confident, and insisted on carrying out his wishes; so a day was fixed for carrying out the task. The people streamed out to the place where the trial was to take place, like as to a huge festival. And all pitied the handsome youth, and had sad misgivings as to his fate. The king granted three days to those who tried their fortune, and three guesses. On the first and second day, in order not to betray the plot, and in order to increase the \u00c3\u00a9clat the prince guessed wrongly on purpose; but on the third day, when everyone was convinced that he must die, he disclosed in a loud voice the secret marks of the princess. The king declared them to be right, and the prince was led to his future wife, amidst the cheers of the multitude and the joyous strains of the band. The king ordered immense wedding festivities all over the town, and resigned his throne in favor of his son-in-law, who reigned happy for many years after!", "title": "The Youngest Prince and the Youngest Princess", "id": 640}

{"label": "451", "text": "Once on a time there was a queen who was out driving, when there had been a new fall of snow in the winter; but when she had gone a little way, she began to bleed at the nose, and had to get out of her sledge. And so, as she stood there, leaning against the fence, and saw the red blood on the white snow, she fell a thinking how she had twelve sons and no daughter, and she said to herself, 'If I only had a daughter as white as snow and as red as blood, I shouldn't care what became of all my sons.' But the words were scarce out of her mouth before an old witch of the trolls came up to her. 'A daughter you shall have,' she said, 'and she shall be as white as snow and as red as blood; and your sons shall be mine, but you may keep them till the babe is christened.' So when the time came the queen had a daughter, and she was as white as snow, and as red as blood, just as the troll had promised, and so they called her 'Snow-White and Rosy-Red.' Well, there was great joy at the king's court, and the queen was as glad as glad could be; but when what she had promised to the old witch came into her mind, she sent for a silversmith, and bade him make twelve silver spoons, one for each prince, and after that she bade him make one more, and that she gave to Snow-White and Rosy-Red. But as soon as ever the princess was christened, the princes were turned into twelve wild ducks, and flew away. They never saw them again. Away they went, and away they stayed. So the princess grew up, and she was both tall and fair, but she was often so strange and sorrowful, and no one could understand what it was that ailed her. But one evening, the queen was also sorrowful, for she had many strange thoughts when she thought of her sons. She said to Snow-White and Rosy-Red, 'Why are you so sorrowful, my daughter? Is there anything you want? If so, only say the word, and you shall have it.' 'Oh, it seems so dull and lonely here,' said Snow-White and Rosy-Red.' Everyone else has brothers and sisters, but I am all alone; I have none; and that's why I'm so sorrowful.' 'But you had brothers, my daughter,' said the queen. 'I had twelve sons who were your brothers, but I gave them all away to get you.' And so she told her the whole story. So when the princes heard that, she had no rest; for, in spite of all the queen could say or do, and all she wept and prayed, the lassie would set off to seek her brothers, for she thought it was all her fault; and at last she got leave to go away from the palace. On and on she walked into the wide world, so far, yon would never have thought a young lady could have strength to walk so far. So, once, when she was walking through a great, great wood, one day she felt tired, and sat down on a mossy tuft and fell asleep. Then she dreamt that she went deeper and deeper into the wood, till she came to a little wooden hut, and there she found her brothers; just then she woke, and straight before her she saw a worn path in the green moss, and this path went deeper into the wood; so she followed it, and after a long time she came to just such a little wooden house as that she had seen in her dream. Now, when she went into the room there was no one at home, but there stood twelve beds, and twelve chairs, and twelve spoons -- a dozen of everything, in short. So when she saw that she was so glad, she hadn't been so glad for many a long year, for she could guess at once that her brothers lived here, and that they owned the beds, and chairs, and spoons. So she began to make up the fire, and sweep the room, and make the beds, and cook the dinner, and to make the house as tidy as she could; and when she had done all the cooking and work, she ate her own dinner, and crept under her youngest brother's bed, and lay down there, but she forgot her spoon upon the table. So she had scarcely laid herself down before she heard something flapping and whirring in the air, and so all the twelve wild ducks came sweeping in; but as soon as they crossed over the threshold they became princes. 'Oh, how nice and warm it is in here,' they said. 'Heaven bless him who made up the fire, and cooked such a good dinner for us.' And so each took up his silver spoon and was going to eat. But when each had taken his own there was one still left lying on the table, and it was so like the rest that they couldn't tell it from them. 'This is our sister's spoon,' they said; 'and if her spoon be here, she can't be very far off herself.' 'If this be our sister's spoon, and she be here,' said the eldest, 'she shall be killed, for she is to blame for all the ill we suffer.' And this she lay under the bed and listened to. 'No' said the youngest; ''twere a shame to kill her for that. She has nothing to do with our suffering ill; for if any one's to blame, it's our own mother.' So they set to work hunting for her both high and low, and at last they looked under all the beds, and so when they came to the youngest prince's bed, they found her, and dragged her out. Then the eldest prince wished again to have her killed, but she begged and prayed so prettily for herself. 'Oh! gracious goodness! don't kill me, for I've gone about seeking you these three years, and if I could only set you free, I'd willingly lose my life.' 'Well! 'said they, 'if you will set us free, you may keep your life; for you can if you choose.' 'Yes; only tell me,' said the princess, 'how it can be done, and I'll do it, whatever it be.' 'You must pick thistledown,' said the princes, 'and you must card it, and spin it, and weave it; and after you have done that, you must cut out and make twelve coats, and twelve shirts, and twelve neckerchiefs, one for each of us, and while you do that, you must neither talk, nor laugh, nor weep. If you can do that, we are free.' 'But where shall I ever get thistle-down enough for so many neckerchiefs, and shirts, and coats? ' asked Snow-White and Rosy-Red. 'We'll soon show you,' said the princes. And so they took her with them to a great wide moor, where there stood such a crop of thistles, all nodding and nodding in the breeze, and the down all floating and glistening like gossamers through the air in the sunbeams. The princess had never seen such a quantity of thistledown in her life, and she began to pluck and gather it as fast and as well as she could; and when she got home at night she set to work carding and spinning yarn from the down. So she went on a long long time, picking, and carding, and spinning, and all the while keeping the princes' house, cooking, and making their beds. At evening home they came, flapping and whirring like wild ducks, and all night they were princes, but in the morning off they flew again, and were wild ducks the whole day. But now it happened once, when she was out on the moor to pick thistledown -- and if I don't mistake, it was the very last time she was to go thither -- it happened that the young king who ruled that land was out hunting, and came riding across the moor and saw her. So he stopped there and wondered who the lovely lady could be that walked along the moor picking thistledown, and he asked her her name, and when he could get no answer, he was still more astonished. And at last he liked her so much, that nothing would do but he must take her home to his castle and marry her. So he ordered his servants to take her and put her up on his horse. Snow-White and Rosy-Red, she wrung her hands, and made signs to them, and pointed to the bags in which her work was, and when the king saw she wished to have them with her, he told his men to take up the bags behind them. When they had done that the princess came to herself, little by little, for the king was both a wise man and a handsome man too, and he was as soft and kind to her as a doctor. But when they got home to the palace, and the old queen, who was his stepmother, set eyes on Snow-White and Rosy-Red, she got so cross and jealous of her because she was so lovely, that she said to the king, 'Can't you see now, that this thing whom you have picked up, and whom you are going to many, is a witch. Why, she can't either talk, or laugh, or weep!' But the king didn't care a pin for what she said, but held on with the wedding, and married Snow-White and Rosy-Red, and they lived in great joy and glory; but she didn't forget to go on sewing at her shirts. So when the year was almost out, Snow-White and Rosy-Red brought a prince into the world, and then the old queen was more spiteful and jealous than ever, and at dead of night, she stole in to Snow-White and Rosy-Red, while she slept, and took away her babe, and threw it into a pit full of snakes. After that she cut Snow-White and Rosy-Red in her finger, and smeared the blood over her mouth, and went straight to the king. 'Now come and see,' she said, 'what sort of a thing you have taken for your queen; here she has eaten up her own babe.' Then the king was so downcast, he almost burst into tears, and said, 'Yes, it must be true, sure I see it with my own eyes; but she'll not do it again, I'm sure, and so this time I'll spare her life.' So before the next year was out she had another son, and the same thing happened. The king's stepmother got more and more jealous and spiteful. She stole in to the young queen at night while she slept, took away the babe, and threw it into a pit full of snakes, cut the young queen's finger, and smeared the blood over her mouth, and then went and told the king she had eaten up her own child. Then the king was so sorrowful, you can't think how sorry he was, and he said, 'Yes, it must be true, since I see it with my own eyes; but she'll not do it again, I'm sure, and so this time too I'll spare her life.' Well! before the next year was out, Snow-White and Rosy-Red brought a daughter into the world, and her, too, the old queen took and threw into the pit full of snakes, while the young queen slept. Then she cut her finger, smeared the blood over her mouth, and went again to the king and said, ' Now you may come and see if it isn't as I say; she's a wicked, wicked witch for here she has gone and eaten up her third babe too.' Then the king was so sad, there was no end to it, for now he couldn't spare her any longer, but had to order her to be burnt alive on a pile of wood. But just when the pile was all ablaze, and they were going to put her on it, she made signs to them to take twelve boards and lay them round the pile, and on these she laid the neckerchiefs, and the shirts, and the coats for her brothers, but the youngest brother's shirt wanted its left arm, for she hadn't had time to finish it. And as soon as ever she had done that, they heard such a flapping and whirring in the air, and down came twelve wild ducks flying over the forest, and each of them snapped up his clothes in his bill and flew off with them. 'See now! ' said the old queen to the king, 'Wasn't I right when I told you she was a witch; but make haste and burn her before the pile burns low.' 'Oh!' said the king, 'We've wood enough and to spare, and so I'll wait a bit, for I have a mind to see what the end of all this will be.' As he spoke up came the twelve princes riding along, as handsome well-grown lads as you'd wish to see; but the youngest prince had a wild duck's wing instead of his left arm. 'What's all this about?' asked the princes. 'My queen is to be burnt,' said the king, 'because she's a witch, and because she has eaten up her own babes.' 'She hasn't eaten them at all,' said the princes. 'Speak now, sister. You have set us free and saved us, now save yourself.' Then Snow-White and Rosy-Red spoke, and told the whole story; how every time she was brought to bed, the old queen, the king's stepmother, had stolen into her at night, and taken her babes away, and cut her little finger, and smeared the blood over her mouth. And then the princes took the king, and showed him the snake pit where three babes lay playing with adders and toads, and lovelier children you never saw. So the king had them taken out at once, and went to his stepmother, and asked her what punishment she thought that woman deserved who could find it in her heart to betray a guiltless queen and three such blessed little babes. 'She deserves to be fast bound between twelve unbroken steeds, so that each may take his share of her,' said the old queen. 'You have spoken your own doom,' said the king, 'and you shall suffer it at once.' So the wicked old queen was fast bound between twelve unbroken steeds, and each got his share of her. But the king took Snow-White and Rosy-Red, and their three children, and the twelve princes; and so they all went home to their father and mother, and told all that had befallen them, and there was joy and gladness over the whole kingdom, because the princess was saved and set free, and because she had set free her twelve brothers.", "title": "The Twelve Wild Ducks", "id": 642}
{"label": "777", "text": "A legend claims that in olden times this region blossomed like the rose, and that the highest mountains were as fertile as any valley nestling in a sheltered location at their foot. When Our Lord bade the Wandering Jew [footnote: See the author's Legends of the Virgin and Christ.] begin the never-ending journey for which he is so noted, he immediately set out, and tramping incessantly, started to cross the Alps at the Grimsel. Although constantly urged along by a power he could not resist, Ahasuerus, the Jew, marked the happy people dwelling on the banks of the Aare and the Rh\u00c3\u00b4ne, and marvelled at the extreme fertility of the pass, where grapes and figs grew in abundance, where no barren spot could be seen, and where mighty oaks covered the tops of mountains now crowned by eternal snows. The air was mild and balmy, even at the greatest altitude; and hosts of birds in bright plumage flitted about, twittering and singing in the merriest way. Ahasuerus also noticed that the people were gentle and hospitable, for wherever he asked for food or drink it was quickly granted, and he was warmly invited to tarry with them and rest his weary limbs. This invitation, however, he could not accept; but hurried on, unconscious of the fact that a blight fell over every place through which he passed; for the curse laid upon him not only condemned him to move on for ever, but enhanced his punishment by making cold, want, and pestilence follow in his train. Many years passed by before the Wandering Jew again found himself near the Alps; but weary as he was, he somewhat quickened his footsteps, hoping to feast his eyes upon the landscape which had so charmed him the first time, and to meet again the warm-hearted people who had been so kind to him once before. As he drew near the mountains, however, sad forebodings wrung his heart, for they were enveloped in a dense fog, which seemed to him particularly cold and clammy. Hurrying on up the pass, he eagerly looked from side to side, yet saw nothing but dark pines wildly tossing their sombre branches against a gray sky, while ravens and owls flew past him, croaking and hooting. Vines, figs, and oaks had vanished, and the happy people, driven away by the constant windstorms which swept the mountains, had taken refuge in the sheltered valleys. But although all else was changed, the spirit of hospitality still lingered on the heights, for the charcoal-burners gladly shared their meagre supply of coarse food with the Wandering Jew, and warmly invited him to be seated at their campfire. The Jew, however, had to hasten on; and many long years elapsed before he again trod the Grimsel Pass. For a while he still perceived dark firs and smouldering fires, but it seemed to him that they were much nearer the foot of the mountain than they had been at his second visit. As he climbed upward he also noticed that the path was much more rugged than before, for rocks and stones had fallen down upon it from above, making it almost impassable in certain places. As no obstacle could stop this involuntary traveller, he went on over rolling stones and jagged rocks, and nearing the top of the pass discovered that every trace of vegetation had vanished, and that the place formerly so fertile was now covered with barren rocks and vast fields of snow. Raising his eyes to the peaks all around him he perceived that oaks, beeches, and pines had all vanished, and that the steep mountain sides were heavily coated with ice, which ran far down into the valleys in great frozen streams. The sight of all this desolation, which had taken the place of such luxuriant vegetation, proved too much for poor Ahasuerus, who sank down on a rock by the wayside and burst into tears. There he sat and sobbed, as he realised for the first time the blighting effect of his passage. His tears flowed so freely that they trickled down into a rocky basin, and when he rose to pursue his way down into the Hasli Valley, he left a little lake behind him. In spite of the masses of snow and ice all around, and of the cold winds which constantly sweep over that region, the waters of the lake still remain as warm as the tears which fell from Ahasuerus's eyes; and no fish are ever found in this pool. Still, notwithstanding the desolate landscape, Ahasuerus found the spirit of hospitality not quite dead, for far up on the pass rose a shelter for weary travellers, where they were carefully tended by pious monks. But even here he could not rest, and as he passed along down the mountain, he heard the thunder of falling avalanches behind him. It is during this last journey that he is supposed to have lost the queer old shoe which was long treasured in one of the vaults of the Bern Library. It is also said that when pausing at one of the huts in the Hasli Valley, he sorrowfully foretold that when fate brought him there for the fourth and last time, the whole fruitful valley, from the top of the mountains down to the Lake of Brienz, would be transformed into a huge unbroken field of ice, where he would wander alone in quest of the final resting-place which until now has been denied him, although Eugene Field claims he found it in the New World. [Footnote: See 'The Holy Cross' by Eugene Field.] This account of the passage of the Wandering Jew is told with slight variations of all the passes between Switzerland and Italy. Every particularly barren spot in the former country is supposed to have been blighted because he passed through there, or because mortals sinned so grievously that they brought a curse down upon it.", "title": "The Wandering Jew on the Grimsel Pass", "id": 643}
{"label": "777", "text": "In this year [1228] a certain archbishop of Armenia Major came on a pilgrimage to England to see the relics of the saints, and visit the sacred places in this kingdom, as he had done in others; he also produced letters of recommendation from his holiness the pope to the religious men and prelates of the churches, in which they were enjoined to receive and entertain him with due reverence and honour. On his arrival he went to St. Alban's, where he was received with all respect by the abbat and monks; at this place, being fatigued with his journey, he remained some days to rest himself and his followers, and a conversation was commenced between him and the inhabitants of the convent by means of their interpreters, during which he made many inquiries concerning the religion and religious observances of this country, and related many strange things concerning eastern countries. In the course of conversation he was asked whether he had ever seen or heard anything of Joseph, a man of whom there was much talk in the world, who, when our Lord suffered, was present and spoke to him, and who is still alive in evidence of the Christian faith, in reply to which a knight in his retinue, who was his interpreter, replied, speaking in French, 'My lord well knows that man, and a little before he took his way to the western countries the said Joseph ate at the table of my lord the archbishop in Armenia, and he had often seen and held converse with him.' He was then asked about what had passed between Christ and the same Joseph, to which he replied: At the time of the suffering of Jesus Christ, he was seized by the Jews and led into the hall of judgment, before Pilate the governor, that he might be judged by him on the accusation of the Jews, and Pilate finding no cause for adjudging him to death, said to them, 'Take him and judge him according to your law.' The shouts of the Jews, however, increasing, he, at their request, released unto them Barabbas, and delivered Jesus to them to be crucified. When therefore the Jews were dragging Jesus forth, and had reached the door, Cartaphilus, a porter of the hall in Pilate's service, as Jesus was going out of the door, impiously struck him on the back with his hand, and said in mockery, 'Go quicker, Jesus, go quicker, why do you loiter?' And Jesus looking back on him with a severe countenance said to him, 'I am going, and you will wait till I return.' And according as our Lord said, this Cartaphilus is still awaiting his return; at the time of our Lord's suffering he was thirty years old, and when he attains the age of a hundred years, he always returns to the same age as he was when our Lord suffered. After Christ's death, when the Catholic faith gained ground, this Cartaphilus was baptized by Ananias (who also baptized the apostle Paul), and was called Joseph. He often dwells in both divisions of Armenia, and other eastern countries, passing his time amidst the bishops and other prelates of the church. He is a man of holy conversation and religious, a man of few words and circumspect in his behaviour, for he does not speak at all unless when questioned by the bishops and religious men; and then he tells of the events of old times, and of the events which occurred at the suffering and resurrection of our Lord, and of the witnesses of the resurrection, namely those who rose with Christ, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto men; he also tells of the creed of the apostles, and of their separation and preaching; and all this he relates without smiling or levity of conversation, as one who is well practised in sorrow and the fear of God, always looking forward with fear to the coming of Jesus Christ, lest at the last judgment he should find him in anger, whom, when on his way to death, he had provoked to just vengeance. Numbers come to him from different parts of the world, enjoying his society and conversation, and to them, if they are men of authority, he explains all doubts on the matters on which he is questioned. He refuses all gifts that are offered to him, being content with slight food and clothing. He places his hope of salvation on the fact that he sinned through ignorance, for the Lord when suffering prayed for his enemies in these words, 'Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.'", "title": "Of the Jew Joseph Who Is Still Alive Awaiting the Last Coming of Christ", "id": 644}
{"label": "130", "text": "After he had walked quite a way he met an old bull in the veldt. 'Don't you want to go with me?' asked the dog. 'Where?' was the reply. 'To the land of the aged,' said the dog, 'where troubles don't disturb you, and thanklessness does not deface the deeds of man.' 'Good,' said the bull, 'I am your companion.' The two now walked on and found a ram. The dog laid the plan before him, and all moved off together, until they afterwards came successively upon a donkey, a cat, a cock, and a goose. These joined their company, and the seven set out on their journey. Late one night they came to a house, and through the open door they saw a table spread with all kinds of nice food, of which some robbers were having their fill. It would help nothing to ask for admittance, and seeing that they were hungry, they must think of something else. Therefore the donkey climbed up on the bull, the ram on the donkey, the dog on the ram, the cat on the dog, the goose on the cat, and the cock on the goose, and with one accord they all let out terrible (threatening) noises (cryings). The bull began to bellow, the donkey to bray, the dog to bark, the ram to bleat, the cat to mew, the goose to giggle gaggle, and the cock to crow, all without cessation. The people in the house were frightened perfectly limp; they glanced out through the front door, and there they stared on the strange sight. Some of them took to the ropes over the back lower door, some disappeared through the window, and in a few counts the house was empty. Then the seven old animals climbed down from one another, stepped into the house, and satisfied themselves with the delicious food. But when they had finished, there still remained a great deal of food, too much to take with them on their remaining journey, and so together they contrived a plan to hold their position until the next day after breakfast. The dog said, 'See here, I am accustomed to watch at the front door of my master's house,' and thereupon flopped himself down to sleep; the bull said, 'I go behind the door,' and there he took his position; the ram said, I will go up on to the loft'; the donkey, 'I at the middle door'; the cat, 'I in the fireplace'; the goose, 'I in the back door '; and the cock said, 'I am going to sleep on the bed.' The captain of the robbers after a while sent one of his men back to see if these creatures had yet left the house. The man came very cautiously into the neighborhood, listened and listened, but he heard nothing; he peeped through the window, and saw in the grate just two coals still glimmering, and thereupon started to walk through the front door. There the old dog seized him by the leg. He jumped into the house, but the bull was ready, swept him up with his horns, and tossed him on to the loft. Here the ram received him and pushed him off the loft again. Reaching ground, he made for the middle door, but the donkey set up a terrible braying and at the same time gave him a kick that landed him in the fireplace, where the cat flew at him and scratched him nearly to pieces. He then jumped out through the back door, and here the goose got him by the trousers. When he was some distance away the cock crowed. He thereupon ran so that you could hear the stones rattle in the dark. Purple and crimson and out of breath, he came back to his companions. 'Frightful, frightful!' was all that they could get from him at first, but after a while he told them, 'When I looked through the window I saw in the fireplace two bright coals shining, and when I wanted to go through the front door to go and look, I stepped into an iron trap. I jumped into the house, and there some one seized me with a fork and pitched me up on to the loft, there again someone was ready, and threw me down on all fours. I wanted to fly through the middle door, but there some one blew on a trumpet, and smote me with a sledge hammer so that I did not know where I landed; but coming to very quickly, I found I was in the fireplace, and there another flew at me and scratched the eyes almost out of my head. I thereupon fled out of the back door, and lastly I was attacked on the leg by the sixth with a pair of fire tongs, and when I was still running away, someone shouted out of the house, 'Stop him, stop h - i - m!''

{"label": "650A", "text": "A peasant had a son who was only as big as a thumb and did not grow any larger. In several years he did not grow even the width of a hair. One day the peasant wanted to go to the field and plow, and the little one said, 'Father, I want to go out with you.' 'No,' said the father, 'you have to stay here. There's nothing that you could do to help me, and besides that you might get lost.' Then the thumbling began to cry and was not going to give the father any peace until he took him along. So the father put him in his pocket and carried him to the field, where he placed him in a fresh furrow. While he was sitting there a large giant came over the mountain towards them. 'Do you see that bogeyman?' said the father, in order to frighten the little one into being good. 'He's coming to get you.' Now the giant had very long legs, and he reached the furrow in only a few steps, picked up the little thumbling, and walked away with him. The father stood there so frightened that he could not speak a word. He believed that his child was lost, and that he would never see him again as long as he lived. The giant took the child home and let him suckle at his breast, and the thumbling grew large and strong like a giant. After two years had passed, the old giant took him into the woods in order to test him. He said, 'Pull out a switch from over there.' The boy was so strong already that a pulled a young tree up by the roots. The giant thought that he could do better and took him back home and suckled him for two more years. When he took him into the woods to test him this time, he pulled up a much larger tree. This was still not good enough for the giant, and he suckled him for yet another two years, took him into the woods, and said, 'Now pull out a decent switch for once.' This time the boy pulled the thickest oak tree out of the ground. He cracked it and laughed. When the old giant saw this, he said, 'That's good enough. You've passed the test.' And he took him back to the field where he found him. The father was plowing again, and the young giant walked up to him and said, 'Father, see what has become of me. I am your son.' The peasant was frightened and said, 'No, you are not my son. Get away from me.' 'Of course I am your son. Just let me plow. I can do it just as well as you can.' 'No, you are not my son. You can't plow. Get away from me.' He was so afraid of the large man that he let go of the plow and walked to the edge of the field. The boy picked up the handle to plow, but he pushed so hard with his one hand that the plow sank deep into the earth. The peasant could not watch this, and called to him, 'If you insist on plowing, then don't push down so hard, or you will ruin the field.' Then the boy hitched himself in front of the plow and said, 'Go on home and tell mother that she should cook up a big plate of something to eat. In the meantime, I'll tear around the field.' The peasant went home and told his wife to fix something to eat, and she cooked up a large dinner, and the boy plowed the field: two full acres all by himself. Then he hitched himself to the harrow and harrowed the entire thing, pulling two harrows at the same time. When he was finished he went into the woods, pulled up two oak trees, laid them on his shoulders, then put a harrow on each end and a horse on each end as well, and carried the whole thing home like a bundle of straw. When he walked into the farmyard, his mother did not recognize him and asked, 'Who is this terrible large man?' The peasant said, 'This is our son.' She said, 'No, this could never be our son. We did not have such a large child. Ours was a little thing. Go away. We don't want you.' The boy said nothing. He pulled his horses into the stall, gave them oats and hay, and put everything in order. When he was finished he went into the house, sat down on the bench, and said, 'Mother, I'd like to eat. Will it be ready soon?' She said, 'Yes,' and did not dare to contradict him. She brought in two very large plates, more than she and her husband could have eaten in an entire week. He ate it all and asked if they didn't have more. 'No,' she said. 'That's all that we have.' 'That was only a taste. I have to have more.' Then she went out and filled a large hog cauldron and put it on the fire, and when it was done she brought it in. 'That's a nice little bit,' he said, and ate the whole thing, but it still wasn't enough. Then he said, 'Father, I see that I'll never be full if I stay here with you. If you can get me an iron rod that is so strong I can't break it against my knees, then I'll go away again.' The peasant was happy to hear this. He hitched his two horses to his wagon and drove to the blacksmith and got a rod so large and thick that the two horses could barely pull it. The boy held it against his knees and -- crash! -- he broke it in two like a bean pole. Then the peasant hitched up four horses and brought back a rod that was so large and thick that the four horses could barely pull it. The son picked up this one as well, cracked it in two against his knee, tossed it aside, and said, 'Father, this one is of no use to me. Hitch up more horses and get me a stronger staff.' So the father hitched up eight horses and fetched one so large and thick that the eight horses could barely pull it. When the son received this one, he broke a little piece from the top of it and said, 'Father, I see that you can't get me a proper staff, so I'll just go away anyhow.' So he went on his way, claiming to be a journeyman blacksmith. He came to a village where a smith lived who was a real cheapskate. He would never give anything to anyone, and always wanted everything for himself. The young giant walked into his smithy and asked him if he could use a journeyman. 'Yes,' answered the smith, looking at him and thinking what a strong fellow he was, someone who could really earn his keep. 'What kind of wages do you want?' 'I don't want any wages at all,' said the young giant. 'But at the end of every two weeks when the other journeymen receive their pay, just let me hit you twice. And you'll have to be able to take it.' The cheapskate was only too happy with this arrangement, for he thought that it would save him a lot of money. The next morning the new journeyman was to have the first turn at the anvil. The master brought out a glowing rod, and the young giant knocked it into two pieces with his first blow, at the same time driving the anvil so deep into the ground that they could not get it back out again. This made the cheapskate angry, and he said, 'I can't use you here. Your blows are too rough. What do you need for pay?' The young giant said, 'Just a little kick, nothing more.' He lifted up his foot and gave him a kick that sent him flying over four loads of hay. Then he took the thickest rod from the smithy to use as a walking stick, and went on his way. Sometime later he came to an estate and asked the overseer if he could use a chief farmhand. 'Yes,' said the overseer. 'You look like a strong fellow who knows how to work. What kind of yearly wage do you want.' The young giant replied that the only pay he wanted was to be able to give the overseer three blows, and that he would have to be able to stand them. The overseer was satisfied with this, for he too was a cheapskate. The next morning the workers were supposed to go to work in the woods. The others were already up, but the young giant was still lying in bed. One of them shouted to him, 'Get up now. It's time to go to the woods, and you have to come along too.' He replied, coarsely and sarcastically, 'Go on without me. I'll be finished before any of you.' The others reported to the overseer that the new chief farmhand was still lying in bed and would not go to the woods with them. The overseer told them to wake him up again and tell him to harness the horses. The young giant answered the same as before, 'Go on without me. I'll be finished before any of you.' He slept two more hours, then finally got out of bed, got two shovels full of peas from the barn, cooked them, ate them at his leisure, and when he had finished all this, he harnessed the horses and drove them to the woods. Just before the woods, the road passed through a hollow. He drove his wagon through the hollow, but then filled it in with such a pile of trees and branches that no horse would ever be able to get through. He had just arrived in the woods when he met the others on their way home with their loaded wagons. He said to them, 'Drive on. I'll be home before you are.' He drove a little further into the woods, ripped two of the largest trees out of the ground, loaded them onto his wagon, and turned around. When he came to the pile of trees and branches, the others were just standing there, unable to get through. He said, 'See, if you had stayed with me, you could have gone straight home, and you'd be able to sleep an extra hour.' He started to drive through, but his four horses couldn't make it, so he unhitched them, hitched himself to the wagon, and pulled it through as easily as if it had been loaded with feathers. When he was on the other side of the rubble he called out, 'See, I got through before you did,' and he drove off, leaving them standing there. When he arrived at the farmyard he picked up a tree with one hand, showed it to the overseer, and said, 'How is this for a measuring stick?' Then the overseer said to his wife, 'This chief farmhand is all right. Even when he sleeps in, he arrives home before the others.' He worked for the overseer for one year. When the year had passed and the other workers received their wages, he said that it was also time for his payment. The overseer became frightened that he was going to have to receive his blows, and he asked him to spare him. If he would do so, the overseer himself would become chief farmhand, and the young giant could become overseer. 'No,' replied the young giant. 'I do not want to be overseer. I am chief farmhand and will remain chief farmhand. I only want to deliver what was promised me.' The overseer offered to give him anything that he asked for, but there was no way out. The chief farmhand insisted on the original agreement. The overseer did not know what else to do, so he asked for an extension of two weeks, and then called all of his clerks together and asked for their advice. They thought for a long time, and finally concluded that the chief farmhand would have to die. He would be asked to bring a load of large millstones to the edge of the well in the farmyard, then he would be sent down into the well to clean it, and while he was down there, they would throw the millstones onto his head. The overseer was delighted with this plan. Everything was prepared. The largest millstones were brought in. As soon as the chief farmhand was down in the well, they rolled the stones in on top of him. They fell with a great splash. Everyone thought that they had crushed his head, but he called out, 'Chase the chickens away from the well. They are scratching in the sand, and throwing little grains into my eyes until I can't see.' The overseer called out, 'Shoo! Shoo!' as though he were chasing the chickens away. When the chief farmhand was finished, he climbed out and said, 'Look at this nice necklace.' He was wearing the millstones around his neck. When the overseer saw that he again became frightened again, because the chief farmhand wanted to give him his wages, so he asked for another extension of fourteen days. He summoned the clerks, and they advised him to send the farmhand to the haunted mill to grind grain during the night. No human had ever come from there alive. This advice pleased the overseer, and that same evening he summoned the farmhand and told him to haul eight bushels of grain to the mill and to grind it during the night. They were in need of it. So the chief farmhand went to the loft and put two bushels in his right pocket and two bushels in his left pocket. Then he loaded four bushels in a large sack which he carried over his shoulder. He took all this to the haunted mill. The miller told him that during the daytime he could grind the grain very well, but at nighttime the mill was haunted and anyone who went inside during the night was found dead the next morning. The farmhand said, 'I will do all right. Just leave me alone and go to bed now.' Then he went inside the mill and dumped out the grain. When it began to strike eleven he went into the sitting area and sat on a bench. He had just eaten a little when the door opened and a large table came inside. On the table were wine, roasted meat, and many good things to eat. Everything was by itself; no one had carried it in. Then the chairs moved themselves into place, but no one was there. Suddenly he saw fingers handling the knives and forks and placing food onto the plates, but he could see nothing else. He was hungry, and he could see food, so he sat down and ate alongside the unseen ones, and everything tasted very good. He was full, and the others had cleaned off their plates as well, when suddenly all the lights were blown out. He heard this very distinctly. Sitting there in total darkness, something gave him a slap in the face. He said, 'If you do that again, I'll give the same thing back to you.' He received a second slap, and he struck back. Thus it continued the entire night, but he was never afraid, always striking back fiercely. At daybreak everything ceased. When the miller got up, he looked in on the farmhand to see how he was, and was amazed to see that he was still alive. The farmhand said, 'I received some slaps, but I also gave out some slaps, and had plenty to eat.' The miller was delighted and said that the mill was now freed of its curse, and he offered him a large sum of money as a reward. But the farmhand said, 'I don't want any money; I have enough.' Then he loaded his flour onto his back and returned home. He told the overseer he had completed the task and now wanted the wages that they had agreed upon. The overseer, beside himself with fear, walked back and forth in his room until sweat dripped from his face. He opened the window for some fresh air. Before he knew what had happened, the young giant kicked him from behind. He flew so far through the air, that no one has seen him since. Then the young giant turned to the overseer's wife and said that she would have to receive the next blow. 'No, I'd never be able to withstand it,' she said, and opened a window, because of the sweat dripping from her face. He gave her a kick as well, and she flew even higher than her husband. 'Come to me,' he called to her. 'No, you come to me,' she called back. 'I can't come to you.' And they soared through the air, neither of them able to get to the other one. I do not know if they are still soaring. But as for the young giant, he picked up his iron rod and went on his way.", "title": "The Young Giant", "id": 646}
{"label": "231", "text": "There was once a heron in a certain place on the edge of a pond. Being old, he sought an easy way of catching fish on which to live. He began by lingering at the edge of his pond, pretending to be quite irresolute, not eating even the fish within his reach. Now among the fish lived a crab. He drew near and said: 'Uncle, why do you neglect today your usual meals and amusements?' And the heron replied: 'So long as I kept fat and flourishing by eating fish, I spent my time pleasantly, enjoying the taste of you. But a great disaster will soon befall you. And as I am old, this will cut short the pleasant course of my life. For this reason I feel depressed.' 'Uncle,' said the crab, 'of what nature is the disaster?' And the heron continued: 'Today I overheard the talk of a number of fishermen as they passed near the pond. 'This is a big pond,' they were saying, 'full of fish. We will try a cast of the net tomorrow or the day after. But today we will go to the lake near the city.' This being so, you are lost, my food supply is cut off, I too am lost, and in grief at the thought, I am indifferent to food today.' Now when the water-dwellers heard the trickster's report, they all feared for their lives and implored the heron, saying: 'Uncle! Father! Brother! Friend! Thinker! Since you are informed of the calamity, you also know the remedy. Pray save us from the jaws of this death.' Then the heron said: 'I am a bird, not competent to contend with men. This, however, I can do. I can transfer you from this pond to another, a bottomless one.' By this artful speech they were so led astray that they said: 'Uncle! Friend! Unselfish kinsman! Take me first! Me first! Did you never hear this? Stout hearts delight to pay the price Of merciful self-sacrifice, Count life as nothing, if it end In gentle service to a friend.' Then the old rascal laughed in his heart, and took counsel with his mind, thus: 'My shrewdness has brought these fishes into my power. They ought to be eaten very comfortably.' Having thus thought it through, he promised what the thronging fish implored, lifted some in his bill, carried them a certain distance to a slab of stone, and ate them there. Day after day he made the trip with supreme delight and satisfaction, and meeting the fish, kept their confidence by ever new inventions. One day the crab, disturbed by the fear of death, importuned him with the words: 'Uncle, pray save me, too, from the jaws of death.' And the heron reflected: 'I am quite tired of this unvarying fish diet. I should like to taste him. He is different, and choice.' So he picked up the crab and flew through the air. But since he avoided all bodies of water and seemed planning to alight on the sun-scorched rock, the crab asked him: 'Uncle, where is that pond without any bottom?' And the heron laughed and said: 'Do you see that broad, sun-scorched rock? All the water-dwellers have found repose there. Your turn has now come to find repose.' Then the crab looked down and saw a great rock of sacrifice, made horrible by heaps of fish-skeletons. And he thought: 'Ah me! Friends are foes and foes are friends As they mar or serve your ends; Few discern where profit tends. Again: If you will, with serpents play; Dwell with foemen who betray: Shun your false and foolish friends, Fickle, seeking vicious ends. Why, he has already eaten these fish whose skeletons are scattered in heaps. So what might be an opportune course of action for me? Yet why do I need to consider? Man is bidden to chastise Even elders who devise Devious courses, arrogant, Of their duty ignorant. Again: Fear fearful things, while yet No fearful thing appears; When danger must be met, Strike, and forget your fears. So, before he drops me there, I will catch his neck with all four claws.' When he did so, the heron tried to escape, but being a fool, he found no parry to the grip of the crab's nippers, and had his head cut off. Then the crab painfully made his way back to the pond, dragging the heron's neck as if it had been a lotus-stalk. And when he came among the fish, they said: 'Brother, why come back?' Thereupon he showed the head as his credentials and said: 'He enticed the water-dwellers from every quarter, deceived them with his prevarications, dropped them on a slab of rock not far away, and ate them. But I -- further life being predestined -- perceived that he destroyed the trustful, and I have brought back his neck. Forget your worries. All the water-dwellers shall live in peace.' And that is why I say: 'A heron ate what fish he could, . . . . and the rest of it.'", "title": "The Heron That Liked Crab-Meat", "id": 647}
{"label": "500", "text": "Long ago there was in service at a Monmouthshire farm a young woman who was merry and strong. Who she was or whence she came nobody knew, but many believed that she belonged to the old breed of Bendith y Mamau. Some time after she had come to the farm, the rumor spread that the house was sorely troubled by a spirit. But the girl and the elf understood one another well, and they became the best of friends. So the elf proved very useful to the maid, for he did everything for her -- washing, ironing, spinning, and twisting wool. In fact, they say that he was remarkably handy at the spinning wheel. Moreover, he expected only a bowlful of sweet milk and wheat bread, or some flummery, for his work. So she took care to place the bowl with his food at the bottom of the stairs every night as she went to bed. It ought to have been mentioned that she was never allowed to catch a sight of him, for he always did his work in the dark. Nor did anybody know when he ate his food. She used to leave the bowl there at night, and it would be empty by the time when she got up in the morning, the bwca having cleared it. But one night, by way of cursedness, what did she do but fill the bowl with some stale urine which they used in dyeing wool and other things about the house. But heavens! it would have been better for her not to have done it, for when she got up next morning what should he do but suddenly spring from some corner and seized her by the neck! He began to beat her and kick her from one end of the house to the other, while he shouted at the top of his voice at every kick: Y faidan din dwmp-- Yn rhoi bara hai\u00c3\u00b0 a thrwnc I'r bwca! The idea that the thick-buttocked lass Should give barley bread and p-- To the bogie! Meanwhile she screamed for help, but none came for some time. When, however, he heard the servant men getting up, he took to his heels as hard as he could; and nothing was heard of him for some time. But at the end of two years he was found to be at another farm in the neighborhood, called Hafod yr Ynys, where he at once became great friends with the servant girl, for she fed him like a young chicken by giving him a little bread and milk all the time. So he worked willingly and well for her in return for his favorite food. More especially, he used to spin and wind the yarn for her; but she wished him in time to show his face, or to tell her his name. He would by no means do either. One evening, however, when all the men were out, and when he was spinning hard at the wheel, she deceived him by telling him that she was also going out. He believed her; and when he heard the door shutting, he began to sing as he plied the wheel: Hi war\u00c3\u00b0a'n iawn pe gypa hi, Taw Gwarwyn-a-throt yw'm enw i. How she would laugh, did she know that Gwarwyn-a-throt is my name! 'Ha! ha!' said the maid at the bottom of the stairs. 'I know thy name now.' 'What is it, then?' he asked. She replied, 'Gwarwyn-a-throt'; and as soon as she uttered the words he left the wheel where it was, and off he went.

{"label": "503", "text": "An old man, somewhat larger than the others, sat in their midst. He wore a brightly colored jacket, and his ice-gray beard hung down over his chest. Filled with amazement, the two wanderers stopped and watched the dance. The old man motioned to them that they too should join in, and the little people voluntarily opened their circle. The goldsmith, who had a hump on his back, and -- like all hunchbacks -- was forward enough, stepped right up. The tailor was at first a little shy and held back, but as soon as he saw what fun it was, he too took heart and joined in. They closed the circle again, and the little people sang and danced wildly forth. However, the old man took a broad knife, that had been hanging from his belt, sharpened it, and as soon as it was sufficiently sharpened, looked at the strangers. They were frightened, but they did not have to worry for long. The old man grabbed the goldsmith and with the greatest speed smoothly shaved off his beard and the hair from his head. Then the same thing happened to the tailor. Their fear disappeared when the old man patted them friendly on their shoulders as if he wanted to say that they had done well by letting it all happen without resisting. With his finger he pointed toward a pile of coal that lay nearby, and indicated to them through gestures that they should fill their pockets with it. They both obeyed, although they did not know of what use the coal would be to them. Then they went on their way to seek out a place to spend the night. They had just arrived in the valley when the bell from a neighboring monastery struck twelve. The singing ceased instantly. Everyone disappeared, and the hill lay in lonely moonlight. The two wanderers found shelter. Lying on beds of straw, they covered themselves with their jackets. They were so tired that they forgot to take the coal out of their pockets first. They were awakened earlier than normal by a heavy weight pressing down on their limbs. They reached into their pockets, and could hardly believe their eyes when they saw that they were not filled with coal, but with pure gold. Further, their hair and their beards had also been fully restored. Now they were rich. However, the goldsmith had twice as much as the tailor, because -- true to his greedy nature -- he had filled his pockets better. However much a greedy person has, he always wants more, so the goldsmith proposed to the tailor that they stay there another day in order to be able to gain even more wealth from the old man on the mountain that evening. The tailor did not want to do this, and said: 'I have enough and am satisfied. I am going to become a master, marry my pleasant object (as he called his sweetheart), and be a happy man.' However, to please the goldsmith, he agreed to stay one more day. That evening the goldsmith hung several bags over his shoulders in order to be able to carry everything, and set off for the hill. As had happened the night before, he found the little people dancing and singing. The old man shaved him smooth once again, and indicated that he should take some coal. Without hesitating he packed away as much as his pockets and bags would hold, and then happily returned home. Covering himself with his jacket he said: 'I can bear it, if the gold presses down on me.' With the sweet premonition that he would awaken tomorrow as a very rich man, he fell asleep. When he opened his eyes, he got up quickly in order to examine his pockets and bags. How astounded he was, that he pulled out nothing but black coal, however often he reached inside. 'Anyway, I still have the gold from the night before,' he thought, and reached for it. Horrified, he saw that it too had turned back into coal. He struck himself on the forehead with his grimy hand, and felt that his entire head was as bald and smooth as his beardless chin. Nor was that the end of his misfortune. Only now did he notice that in addition the hump on his back, a second one, of the same size, had grown onto his chest. Now he recognized the punishment for his greed and began to cry aloud. The good tailor, who had been awakened by all this, consoled the unhappy man as best he could, saying: 'You were my traveling companion, and you can stay with me now and live from my treasure.' He kept his word, but the poor goldsmith had to bear two humps and cover his bald head with a cap as long as he lived.", "title": "The Gifts of the Little People", "id": 649}
{"label": "1191", "text": "According to local tradition this bridge is not of human construction, but rather the work of the devil. Thus all who walk over it cross themselves so that the Evil One cannot harm them. Eighteen hundred years ago the devil made a pact with a miller's wife, promising her that he would build a bridge over the Taugl. If he could accomplish this before she gave birth to the child that she was then carrying under her heart, then this child would be his. When the child was born the bridge was finished except for one final stone that to this day is still missing in the arch. Thus the devil was defeated. Not wanting to return to hell empty-handed, he declared, 'I have lost the child, but I shall take the first being that passes over the bridge.' The miller's wife, a very clever woman, heard this and chased her big tomcat over the bridge. The devil grabbed the cat and took it with him into that deep hole where the Taugl flows downward, foaming with rage.", "title": "The Taugl Bridge", "id": 650}

{"label": "737", "text": "I rue the day, a rueful day I trow, The woeful day, a day indeed of woe! When Lubberkin to town his cattle drove, A maiden fine bedight he hapt to love; The maiden fine bedight his love retains, And for the village he forsakes the plains. Return, my Lubberkin, these ditties hear; Spells will I try, and spells shall ease my care. With my sharp heel I three times mark the ground, And turn me thrice around, around, around. When first the year, I heard the cuckow sing, And call with welcome note the budding spring, I straitway set a running with such haste, Deb'rah that won the smock scarce ran so fast. 'Till spent for lack of breath, quite weary grown, Upon arising bank I sat adown, Then doff'd my shoe, and by my troth, I swear, Therein I spy'd this yellow frizled hair, As like to Lubberkin's in curl and hue, As if upon his comely pate it grew. With my sharp heel I three times mark the ground, And turn me thrice around, around, around. At eve last midsummer no sleep I sought, But to the field a bag of hemp-seed brought, I scatter'd round the seed on ev'ry side, And three times in a trembling accent cry'd, This hemp-seed with my virgin hands I sow, Who shall my true-love be, the crop shall mow. I strait look'd back, and if my eyes speak truth, With his keen scythe behind me came the youth. With my tharp heel I three times mark the ground, And turn me thrice around, around, around. Last Valentine, the day when birds of kind Their paramours with mutual chirpings find; I rearly rose, just at the break of day, Before the sun had chas'd the stars away; A-field I went, amid the morning dew To milk my kine (for so should huswifes do) Thee first I spy'd, and the first swain we see, In spite of fortune shall our true-love be. See, Lubberkin, each bird his partner take, And can'st thou then thy sweetheart dear forsake? With my sharp heel I three times mark the ground, And turn me thrice around, around, around. Last May-day fair I search'd to find a snail That might my secret lover's name reveal; Upon a gooseberry-bush a snail I found, For always snails near sweetest fruit abound. I seiz'd the vermine, home I quickly sped, And on the hearth the milk-white embers spread. Slow crawl'd the snail, and if I right can spell, In the soft Ashes mark'd a curious L; Oh, may this wondrous omen lucky prove! For L is found in Lubberkin and Love. With my sharp heel threetimes mark the ground, And turn me thrice around, around, around. Two hazel-nuts I threw into the flame, And to each nut I gave a sweetheart's name. This with the loudest bounce me sore amaz'd, That in a flame of brightest colour blaz'd. As blaz'd the nut so may thy passion grow, For 'twas thy nut that did so brightly glow. With my tharp heel three times mark the ground, And turn me thrice around, around, around. As peascods once I pluck'd, I chanc'd to see One that was closely fill'd with three times three, Which when I crop'd I safely homeconvey'd, And o'er my door the spell in secret laid. My wheel I turn'd, and sung a ballad new, While from the spindle I the fleeces drew; The latch mov'd up, when who should first come in, But in his proper person, -- Lubberkin. I broke my yarn surpriz'd the sight to see, Sure sign that he would break his word with me. Eftsoons I join'd it with my wonted slight, So may again his love with mine unite! With my sharp heel I three times mark the ground, And turn me thrice around, around, around. This lady-fly I take from off the grass, Whose spotted back might scarlet red surpass. Fly, lady-bird, north, south, or east or west, Fly where the man is sound that I love best. He leaves my hand, see to the west he's flown, To call my true-love from the faithless town. With my sharp heel I three times mark the ground, And turn me thrice around, around, around. I pare this pippin round and round again, My shepherd's name to flourish on the plain. I fling th' unbroken paring o'er my head, Upon the grass a perfect L is read; Yet on my heart a fairer L is seen Than what the paring makes upon the green. With my sharp heel I three times mark the ground, And turn me thrice around, around, around. This pippin shall another trial make: See from the core two kernels brown I take; This on my cheek for Lubberkin is worn, And Boobyclod on t'other side is born; But Boobyclod soon drops upon the ground, A certain token that his love's unsound, While Lubberkin sticks firmly to the last; Oh were his lips to mine but join'd so fast! With my tharp heel three times mark the ground, And turn me thrice around, around, around. As Lubberkin once slept beneath a tree, I twitch'd his dangling garter srom hi sknee; He wist not when the hempen string I drew, Now mine I quickly doff of inkle blue; Together fast I tye the garters twain, And while I knit the knot repeat this strain; Three times a true-love's knot I tye secure, Firm be the knot, firm may his love endure. With my sharp heel I three times mark the ground, And turn me thrice around, around, around. As I was wont, I trudg'd last market-day To town, with new-laid eggs preserv'd in hay; I made my market long before 'twas night, My purse grew heavy and my basket light. Strait to the pothecary's shop I went, And in love-powder all my mony spent; Behap what will, next Sunday after prayers, When to the ale-house Lubberkin repairs, These golden flies into his mug I'll throw, And soon the swain with fervent love shall glow. With my sharp heel I three times mark the ground, And turn me thrice around, around, around. But hold ---- our Light-foot barks, and cocks his ears. O'er yonder stile see Lubberkin appears. He comes, he comes, Hobnelia's not betray'd, Nor shall she crown'd with willow die a maid. He vows, he swears, he'll give me a green gown, Oh dear! I fall adown, adown, adown!", "title": "The Spell", "id": 652}
{"label": "327", "text": "Next to a great forest there lived a poor woodcutter with his wife and his two children. The boy's name was Hansel and the girl's name was Gretel. He had but little to eat, and once, when a great famine came to the land, he could no longer provide even their daily bread. One evening as he was lying in bed worrying about his problems, he sighed and said to his wife, 'What is to become of us? How can we feed our children when we have nothing for ourselves?' 'Man, do you know what?' answered the woman. 'Early tomorrow morning we will take the two children out into the thickest part of the woods, make a fire for them, and give each of them a little piece of bread, then leave them by themselves and go off to our work. They will not find their way back home, and we will be rid of them.' 'No, woman,' said the man. 'I will not do that. How could I bring myself to abandon my own children alone in the woods? Wild animals would soon come and tear them to pieces.' 'Oh, you fool,' she said, 'then all four of us will starve. All you can do is to plane the boards for our coffins.' And she gave him no peace until he agreed. 'But I do feel sorry for the poor children,' said the man. The two children had not been able to fall asleep because of their hunger, and they heard what the stepmother had said to the father. Gretel cried bitter tears and said to Hansel, 'It is over with us!' 'Be quiet, Gretel,' said Hansel, 'and don't worry. I know what to do.' And as soon as the adults had fallen asleep, he got up, pulled on his jacket, opened the lower door, and crept outside. The moon was shining brightly, and the white pebbles in front of the house were glistening like silver coins. Hansel bent over and filled his jacket pockets with them, as many as would fit. Then he went back into the house and said, 'Don't worry, Gretel. Sleep well. God will not forsake us.' Then he went back to bed. At daybreak, even before sunrise, the woman came and woke the two children. 'Get up, you lazybones. We are going into the woods to fetch wood.' Then she gave each one a little piece of bread, saying, 'Here is something for midday. Don't eat it any sooner, for you'll not get any more.' Gretel put the bread under her apron, because Hansel's pockets were full of stones. Then all together they set forth into the woods. After they had walked a little way, Hansel began stopping again and again and looking back toward the house. The father said, 'Hansel, why are you stopping and looking back? Pay attention now, and don't forget your legs.' 'Oh, father,' said Hansel, 'I am looking at my white cat that is sitting on the roof and wants to say good-bye to me.' The woman said, 'You fool, that isn't your cat. That's the morning sun shining on the chimney.' However, Hansel had not been looking at his cat but instead had been dropping the shiny pebbles from his pocket onto the path. When they arrived in the middle of the woods, the father said, 'You children gather some wood, and I will make a fire so you won't freeze.' Hansel and Gretel gathered together some twigs, a pile as high as a small mountain The twigs were set afire, and when the flames were burning well, the woman said, 'Lie down by the fire and rest. We will go into the woods to cut wood. When we are finished, we will come back and get you.' Hansel and Gretel sat by the fire. When midday came each one ate his little piece of bread. Because they could hear the blows of an ax, they thought that the father was nearby. However, it was not an ax. It was a branch that he had tied to a dead tree and that the wind was beating back and forth. After they had sat there a long time, their eyes grew weary and closed, and they fell sound sleep. When they finally awoke, it was dark at night. Gretel began to cry and said, 'How will we get out of woods?' Hansel comforted her, 'Wait a little until the moon comes up, and then we'll find the way.' After the full moon had come up, Hansel took his little sister by the hand. They followed the pebbles that glistened there like newly minted coins, showing them the way. They walked throughout the entire night, and as morning was breaking, they arrived at the father's house. They knocked on the door, and when the woman opened it and saw that it was Hansel and Gretel, she said, 'You wicked children, why did you sleep so long in the woods? We thought that you did not want to come back.' But the father was overjoyed when he saw his children once more, for he had not wanted to leave them alone. Not long afterward there was once again great need everywhere, and one evening the children heard the mother say to the father, 'We have again eaten up everything. We have only a half loaf of bread, and then the song will be over. We must get rid of the children. We will take them deeper into the woods, so they will not find their way out. Otherwise there will be no help for us.' The man was very disheartened, and he thought, 'It would be better to share the last bit with the children.' But the woman would not listen to him, scolded him, and criticized him. He who says A must also say B, and because he had given in the first time, he had to do so the second time as well. The children were still awake and had overheard the conversation. When the adults were asleep, Hansel got up again and wanted to gather pebbles as he had done before, but the woman had locked the door, and Hansel could not get out. But he comforted his little sister and said, 'Don't cry, Gretel. Sleep well. God will help us.' Early the next morning the woman came and got the children from their beds. They received their little pieces of bread, even less than the last time. On the way to the woods, Hansel crumbled his piece in his pocket, then often stood still, and threw crumbs onto the ground. 'Hansel, why are you always stopping and looking around?' said his father. 'Keep walking straight ahead.' 'I can see my pigeon sitting on the roof. It wants to say good-bye to me.' 'Fool,' said the woman, 'that isn't your pigeon. That's the morning sun shining on the chimney.' But little by little Hansel dropped all the crumbs onto the path. The woman took them deeper into the woods than they had ever been in their whole lifetime. Once again a large fire was made, and the mother said, 'Sit here, children. If you get tired you can sleep a little. We are going into the woods to cut wood. We will come and get you in the evening when we are finished.' When it was midday Gretel shared her bread with Hansel, who had scattered his piece along the path. Then they fell asleep, and evening passed, but no one came to get the poor children. It was dark at night when they awoke, and Hansel comforted Gretel and said, 'Wait, when the moon comes up I will be able to see the crumbs of bread that I scattered, and they will show us the way back home.' When the moon appeared they got up, but they could not find any crumbs, for the many thousands of birds that fly about in the woods and in the fields had pecked them up. Hansel said to Gretel, 'We will find our way,' but they did not find it. They walked through the entire night and the next day from morning until evening, but they did not find their way out of the woods. They were terribly hungry, for they had eaten only a few small berries that were growing on the ground. And because they were so tired that their legs would no longer carry them, they lay down under a tree and fell asleep. It was already the third morning since they had left the father's house. They started walking again, but managed only to go deeper and deeper into the woods. If help did not come soon, they would perish. At midday they saw a little snow-white bird sitting on a branch. It sang so beautifully that they stopped to listen. When it was finished it stretched its wings and flew in front of them. They followed it until they came to a little house. The bird sat on the roof, and when they came closer, they saw that the little house was built entirely from bread with a roof made of cake, and the windows were made of clear sugar. 'Let's help ourselves to a good meal,' said Hansel. 'I'll eat a piece of the roof, and Gretel, you eat from the window. That will be sweet.' Hansel reached up and broke off a little of the roof to see how it tasted, while Gretel stood next to the windowpanes and was nibbling at them. Then a gentle voice called out from inside: But the old woman shook her head and said, 'Oh, you dear children, who brought you here? Just come in and stay with me. No harm will come to you.' She took them by the hand and led them into her house. Then she served them a good meal: milk and pancakes with sugar, apples, and nuts. Afterward she made two nice beds for them, decked in white. Hansel and Gretel went to bed, thinking they were in heaven. But the old woman had only pretended to be friendly. She was a wicked witch who was lying in wait there for children. She had built her house of bread only in order to lure them to her, and if she captured one, she would kill him, cook him, and eat him; and for her that was a day to celebrate. Witches have red eyes and cannot see very far, but they have a sense of smell like animals, and know when humans are approaching. When Hansel and Gretel came near to her, she laughed wickedly and spoke scornfully, 'Now I have them. They will not get away from me again.' Early the next morning, before they awoke, she got up, went to their beds, and looked at the two of them lying there so peacefully, with their full red cheeks. 'They will be a good mouthful,' she mumbled to herself. Then she grabbed Hansel with her withered hand and carried him to a little stall, where she locked him behind a cage door. Cry as he might, there was no help for him. Then she shook Gretel and cried, 'Get up, lazybones! Fetch water and cook something good for your brother. He is locked outside in the stall and is to be fattened up. When he is fat I am going to eat him.' Gretel began to cry, but it was all for nothing. She had to do what the witch demanded. Now Hansel was given the best things to eat every day, but Gretel received nothing but crayfish shells. Every morning the old woman crept out to the stall and shouted, 'Hansel, stick out your finger, so I can feel if you are fat yet.' But Hansel stuck out a little bone, and the old woman, who had bad eyes and could not see the bone, thought it was Hansel's finger, and she wondered why he didn't get fat. When four weeks had passed and Hansel was still thin, impatience overcame her, and she would wait no longer. 'Hey, Gretel!' she shouted to the girl, 'Hurry up and fetch some water. Whether Hansel is fat or thin, tomorrow I am going to slaughter him and boil him.' Oh, how the poor little sister sobbed as she was forced to carry the water, and how the tears streamed down her cheeks! 'Dear God, please help us,' she cried. 'If only the wild animals had devoured us in the woods, then we would have died together.' 'Save your slobbering,' said the old woman. 'It doesn't help you at all.' The next morning Gretel had to get up early, hang up the kettle with water, and make a fire. 'First we are going to bake,' said the old woman. 'I have already made a fire in the oven and kneaded the dough.' She pushed poor Gretel outside to the oven, from which fiery flames were leaping. 'Climb in,' said the witch, 'and see if it is hot enough to put the bread in yet.' And when Gretel was inside, she intended to close the oven, and bake her, and eat her as well. But Gretel saw what she had in mind, so she said, 'I don't know how to do that. How can I get inside?' 'Stupid goose,' said the old woman. The opening is big enough. See, I myself could get in.' And she crawled up stuck her head into the oven. Then Gretel gave her a shove, causing her to fall in. Then she closed the iron door and secured it with a bar. The old woman began to howl frightfully. But Gretel ran away, and the godless witch burned up miserably. Gretel ran straight to Hansel, unlocked his stall, and cried, 'Hansel, we are saved. The old witch is dead.' Then Hansel jumped out, like a bird from its cage when someone opens its door. How happy they were! They threw their arms around each other's necks, jumped with joy, and kissed one another. Because they now had nothing to fear, they went into the witch's house. In every corner were chests of pearls and precious stones. 'These are better than pebbles,' said Hansel, filling his pockets. Gretel said, 'I will take some home with me as well,' and she filled her apron full. 'But now we must leave,' said Hansel, 'and get out of these witch-woods.' After walking a few hours they arrived at a large body of water. 'We cannot get across,' said Hansel. 'I cannot see a walkway or a bridge.' 'There are no boats here,' answered Gretel, 'but there is a white duck swimming. If I ask it, it will help us across.' Then she called out: 'No,' answered Gretel. 'That would be too heavy for the duckling. It should take us across one at a time.' That is what the good animal did, and when they were safely on the other side, and had walked on a little while, the woods grew more and more familiar to them, and finally they saw the father's house in the distance. They began to run, rushed inside, and threw their arms around the father's neck. The man had not had even one happy hour since he had left the children in the woods. However, the woman had died. Gretel shook out her apron, scattering pearls and precious stones around the room, and Hansel added to them by throwing one handful after the other from his pockets. Now all their cares were at an end, and they lived happily together.", "title": "Hansel and Gretel", "id": 653}
{"label": "706", "text": "There was a man and his wife, and they prayed to God to get a child; and they got first a son and next a daughter. And their father's employment was to cut up firewood. And they remained till the children were grown up. And their father was seized by disease. And he called his children, and asked them, 'Will you have blessing or property?' And the son said, 'I will have property.' And the daughter said, 'I will have blessing.' And her father gave her much blessing. And her father died. And they kept the mourning, and when they arose their mother fell sick; and she called her children and said to them, 'Will you have blessing or property?' And her mother gave her blessing. And their mother died. And they kept their mourning, and when they arose the seventh day was come. And the son went and told the woman, his sister, 'Put out all my father's and mother's things.' And the woman put them out, without his leaving her anything. And he took them all away. And people said to him, 'Will you not leave even any little thing for this your sister?' And he said, 'I shall not. I asked for the property, and she for a blessing.' And he left her a cooking pot, and a mortar for cleaning corn; he did not leave her even a little food. Her neighbours used to come and borrow the mortar, and clean their corn, and then they gave her a little grain, and she cooked and ate it. And others used to come and borrow her cooking pots, and cook with them, and then they gave her too a little food. And this was every day her employment. And she searched about in her father and mother's house, without finding anything except a pumpkin seed. And she took it and went and planted it under the well. And a plant sprung up, and bore many pumpkins. Her brother had no news of her, and he asked people, 'Where does my sister get food?' And they told him, 'People borrow her mortar, and they clean their corn, and give her too a little food; and people borrow her cooking pots, and cook with them, and give her too a little food.' And her brother arose and went and robbed her of the mortar and cooking pots. And then she awoke in the morning and sought for food, and could not get it. And she stayed till nine o'clock, and said, 'I will go and look at my pumpkin, whether it has grown.' And she went, and saw that many pumpkins had come. And she was comforted. And she gathered the pumpkins, and went and sold them, and got food. And this was her employment every day, to gather and go and sell. And when the third day came, everyone who ate those pumpkins found them exceedingly sweet. And everybody used to take grain and go to her place and buy. And many days passed, and she got property. Her brother's wife heard that news, and sent her slave with grain to go and buy a pumpkin. And she said, 'They are finished.' And when she knew it was her brother's wife's slave, she told him, 'Take this one, and take back your grain.' And she went and cooked it, and found it very sweet. The next day she sent some one again. And she said, 'There are none at all today.' And he went and told his mistress, and she was exceedingly vexed. When her husband came and asked her, 'What is the matter with you, my wife?' She told him, 'I sent some one to your sister with my grain, to go and ask for pumpkins. She did not send them, and told me, 'There are none'; and other people all buy of her.' And he said to his wife, 'Let us sleep till tomorrow. I will go and pull up her pumpkin plant.' When the morning dawned, he went to his sister and said to her, 'When my wife sent grain, you refused to sell her a pumpkin.' And she said, 'They are finished; the day before yesterday she sent someone, and I gave to him for nothing.' And he said, 'Why are you selling to other people?' And she said, 'They are finished, there are no more, they are not yet come.' And her brother said to her, 'I shall go and cut up your pumpkin.' And she said, 'You dare not, unless indeed you cut my hand off first; then you may cut up the pumpkin.' And her brother took hold of her right hand and cut it off, and went and cut up her pumpkin plant, every bit of it. The woman set on hot water, and put in her arm, and put medicine also, and bound on a cloth. And he took away from her everything, and put her out of the house. And his sister wandered about in the forest, and this her brother sold the house, and gathered much property, and remained spending it. And she wandered in the forest, till on the seventh day she came out upon another town. And she climbed up into a great tree, and ate the fruit of the tree, and in the morning she slept there in the tree. On the next day the son of the king came out shooting birds, he and his people. About twelve o'clock he was tired, and said, 'I will go there by the tree, that I may rest, and you shoot birds.' And he sat under the tree, he and his slave. And the young woman cried till her tears fell upon the king's son below. And he said to his slave, 'Look outside; is it not raining?' And he said, 'It is not, master.' And he said, 'Then climb up into the tree, and look what bird is casting its droppings upon me.' And his slave climbed up, and he saw an exceedingly beautiful woman crying, and without saying a word, he got down. And he told his master, 'There is a most beautiful young woman. I did not venture to say a word to her.' And his master asked him, 'Why?' And he said, 'I found her crying; perhaps you should go yourself.' And his master climbed up, and went and saw her, and said to her, 'What is the matter with you, my mistress? Are you a person or a spirit?' And she said, 'I am a person.' And he said, 'What are you crying about?' And she said, 'I am thinking of things; I am a person as you are.' And he said, 'Come down and let us go to our home.' And she said to him, 'Where is your home?' And he said, 'With my father and mother; I am a king's son.' And she said, 'What did you come to do here?' And he said, 'I come to shoot birds, month by month; this is our employment. I came with my companions.' And she said, 'I do not like to be seen by anybody.' And that woman had told the king's son. And he said, 'We shall not be seen by any one.' And she came down. And he sent his slave, 'Go into the town quickly, and bring me a masheela. And his slave went at once and returned with a masheela and four people, and they carried him. And he put the woman into it, and told his slave, 'Fire a gun, that all the company may know.' And he fired a gun, and his companions came, and they said to him, 'What is the matter with you, son of the king?' And he said, 'I am cold, and I want to go my way into the town.' And they carried the game they had got, and went away. And the king's son had got into the masheela, he and that young woman. And his companions knew nothing of it. And they went to their city, and reached his house. And he said to a man, 'Go and tell my mother and father, I have fever today, I want gruel quickly; let them send it to me.' And his mother and father were troubled, and gruel was cooked for him, and sent to him. And his father went with his vizirs and went to see him. And at night his mother went with her people to see him. The next day he went out, and went and told his mother and father, 'I have picked up a young woman, I want you to marry me to her, but she has lost one hand?' And they said, 'Why?' And he said, 'I wish it just as it is.' And the Sultan loved his only son much, and he made a wedding and married him. And the people heard in the town, 'The Sultan's son has married a young woman, she has lost one hand.' And they remained until his wife became pregnant, and bore a son, and his parents rejoiced exceedingly. And the Sultan's son went on a journey, and went to travel about in the towns of his father. There behind her brother came out; he had nothing to spend, and was going begging. Till one day he heard people conversing, 'The Sultan's son has married a woman who has lost one hand.' And her brother asked, 'Where did he get the girl, this child of the Sultan?' And they told him, 'He picked her up in the forest.' And he knew she was his sister. And he went to the king. And he went and said, 'Your child has married a woman who has lost a hand. She was put out of their town because she was a witch; every husband who marries her, she kills.' And the king went and told his wife, and they said, 'What plan can we act on?' And they loved much their only child, and they said, 'Let us put her out of the town.' And her brother said to them, 'Kill her, for there at home she had her hand cut off, and here kill her.' And they said, 'We cannot kill her, we will put her out of the town.' And they went and put her out of the town, her and her son. And she was comforted. And she went out, and carried a little earthen pot, and went her way into the forest; she knew not where she was going or whence she came. And she sat down, and showed her child, and casting her eyes, she saw a snake come fast towards her, and she said, 'Today I am dead.' And the snake said to her, 'Child of Adam, open your earthern pot that I may go in. Save me from sun, and I will save you from rain.' And she opened the pot, and it went in, and she covered it. And she looked and saw another snake coming fast, and it said to her, 'Has not my companion passed?' And she said, 'It is going.' And it passed quickly. The snake which was in the pot said to her, 'Uncover me.' And she uncovered it, and it was comforted, and said to that child of Adam, 'Where are you going?' And she said, 'I know not where I am going, I am wandering in the wood.' And the snake said to her, 'Follow me, and let us go home.' And they went together till on the road they saw a great lake. And the snake said to her, 'Child of Adam, let us sit and rest, the sun is fierce; go and bathe in the lake with your child.' And she carried her boy, and went to wash him, and he fell in and she lost him in the lake. And it asked her, 'What is the matter with you there, child of Adam?' And she said, ' My child is lost in the water.' And it said, ' Look for him well.' And she sought for him for a whole hour without finding him. And it said, 'Put in the other hand.' And she said, 'You snake are making game of me.' And it asked 'How?' And she said, 'I have put in this sound one, and I have not found him; what is the use of this spoilt one?' And the snake said to her, 'Only you put in both.' And the child of Adam put them in, and went and found her son and laid hold of him, and drew out her hand sound again. And it said, 'Have you found him?' And she said, 'I have found him, and have got my hand sound again.' And she rejoiced much. And the snake said, 'Now let us go away to my elders, and let me repay your kindness.' And she said, ' This is enough, getting my hand.' And it said, 'Not yet; let us go to my elders.' And they went till they arrived, and they rejoiced much, and loved that young woman. And she remained, eating and drinking many days. And her husband returned from his journey. And his elders had caused two tombs to be made, one of his wife and one of his child. And her brother had become a great man with the king. And her husband, the king's son, came. And he asked, 'Where is my wife?' And they said to him, 'She is dead.' 'And where is my child?' And they answered him, 'He is dead.' And he asked, 'Where are their graves?' And they took him to go and see them. And when he saw them he wept much. And he made a mourning. And he was comforted. Many days had passed. And the young woman in the forest said to her friend the snake, 'I want to go away, home.' And it said, 'Take leave of my mother and father. When they give you leave to go, if they give you a present, accept only the father's ring and the mother's casket.' And she went and took leave of them, and they gave her much wealth, and she refused and said, I, one person, how shall I carry this wealth?' And they said, 'What will you have?' And she said, 'You, father, I want your ring; and you, mother, I want your casket.' And they were very sorry, and asked her, 'Who told you about this?' And she said, 'I know it myself.' And they said, 'Not so; it is this your brother who told you.' And he took the ring and gave her, and said to her, 'I give you this ring. If you want food, if you want clothes, if you want a house for sleeping, tell the ring; it will produce it for you by the blessing of God and of me your father.' And her mother gave her the casket, and told her such and such things. And they gave her their blessing. And she went out and went away, till there by the town of her husband, without reaching her husband's house. When she reached the outskirts, she told the ring, 'I want you to produce for me a great house.' And it produced a house, and the furniture of the house and slaves. And she stayed, she and her son. And her son had become a great lad. And the king got news of there being a large house in the outskirts, and he sent people to go and look, and they answered him, 'It is true.' And the sultan arose with his vizirs and his son. And they went and drew near, and the woman looked through a telescope and saw her husband, and her husband's father, and many people, and her brother among them. And she told the people, 'Prepare food quickly.' And they prepared, and laid the table. And they arrived and were invited in, and went inside, and they asked her the news. And she said, 'Good.' And she said to them, 'Eat of the food. I come from a distance; when you have done with the food let me give you my news.' And they ate the food, till when they had finished she told them, from the beginning when she was born, she and her brother, till all were finished, as they had been. And the king's son went to embrace his wife, and they wept much, and all who were there wept, and they knew her brother was not good. And the king asked her, 'What shall we do to your brother?' And she said, 'Only put him out of the town.' And she dwelt with her husband till the end in joy. Another version of this story:", "title": "Blessing or Property", "id": 654}

Mr. Monkey was finally engaged to the young lady, and the night of the wedding he invited his friend to the supper. The latter was jealous of Mr. Monkey, and at the end of the supper he began to sing. This was a song that made all monkeys dance, whether they wished to or not, so Mr. Monkey looked at his friend and beckoned him to stop singing. He continued, however, to sing, and all at once Mr. Monkey got up and began to dance. He jumped about so wildly that his tail came out of his clothes, and everyone saw that he was a monkey.

{"label": "441", "text": "Galeotto, King of Anglia, has a son who is born in the shape of a pig. This son marries three wives, and in the end, having thrown off his semblance, becomes a handsome youth. Fair ladies, if man were to spend a thousand years in rendering thanks to his creator for having made him in the form of a human and not of a brute beast, he could not speak gratitude enough. This reflection calls to mind the story of one who was born as a pig, but afterwards became a comely youth. Nevertheless, to his dying day he was known to the people over whom he ruled as King Pig. You must know, dear ladies, that Galeotto, King of Anglia, was a man highly blest in worldly riches, and in his wife Ersilia, the daughter of Matthias, King of Hungary, a princess who, in virtue and beauty, outshone all the other ladies of the time. And Galeotto was a wise king, ruling his land so that no man could hear complaint against him. Though they had been several years married they had no child, wherefore they both of them were much aggrieved. While Ersilia was walking one day in her garden she felt suddenly weary, and remarking hard by a spot covered with fresh green turf, she went up to it and sat down thereon, and, overcome with weariness and soothed by the sweet singing of the birds in the green foliage, she fell asleep. And it chanced that while she slept there passed by three fairies who held mankind somewhat in scorn, and these, when they beheld the sleeping queen, halted, and gazing upon her beauty, took counsel together how they might protect her and throw a spell upon her. When they were agreed, the first cried out, 'I will that no man shall be able to harm her, and that, the next time she lie with her husband, she may be with child and bear a son who shall not have his equal in all the world for beauty.' Then said the second, 'I will that no one shall ever have power to offend her, and that the prince who shall be born of her shall be gifted with every virtue under the sun.' And the third said, 'And I will that she shall be the wisest among women, but that the son whom she shall conceive shall be born in the skin of a pig, with a pig's ways and manners, and in this state he shall be constrained to abide till he shall have three times taken a woman to wife.' As soon as the three fairies had flown away Ersilia awoke, and straightway arose and went back to the palace, taking with her the flowers she had plucked. Not many days had passed before she knew herself to be with child, and when the time of her delivery was come, she gave birth to a son with members like those of a pig and not of a human being. When tidings of this prodigy came to the ears of the king and queen they lamented sore thereanent, and the king, bearing in mind how good and wise his queen was, often felt moved to put this offspring of hers to death and cast it into the sea, in order that she might be spared the shame of having given birth to him. But when he debated in his mind and considered that this son, let him be what he might, was of his own begetting, he put aside the cruel purpose which he had been harboring, and, seized with pity and grief, he made up his mind that the son should be brought up and nurtured like a rational being and not as a brute beast. The child, therefore, being nursed with the greatest care, would often be brought to the queen and put his little snout and his little paws in his mother's lap, and she, moved by natural affection, would caress him by stroking his bristly back with her hand, and embracing and kissing him as if he had been of human form. Then he would wag his tail and give other signs to show that he was conscious of his mother's affection. The pigling, when he grew older, began to talk like a human being, and to wander abroad in the city, but whenever he came near to any mud or dirt he would always wallow therein, after the manner of pigs, and return all covered with filth. Then, when he approached the king and queen, he would rub his sides against their fair garments, defiling them with all manner of dirt, but because he was indeed their own son they bore it all. One day he came home covered with mud and filth, as was his wont, and lay down on his mother's rich robe, and said in a grunting tone, 'Mother, I wish to get married.' When the queen heard this, she replied, 'Do not talk so foolishly. What maid would ever take you for a husband, and think you that any noble or knight would give his daughter to one so dirty and ill-savored as you?' But he kept on grunting that he must have a wife of one sort or another. They queen, not knowing how to manage him in this matter, asked the king what they should do in their trouble, 'Our son wishes to marry, but where shall we find anyone who will take him as a husband?' Every day the pig would come back to his mother with the same demand, 'I must have a wife, and I will never leave you in peace until you procure for me a certain maiden I have seen today, who pleases me greatly.' It happened that this maiden was a daughter of a poor woman who had three daughters. When the queen heard this, she had brought before her the poor woman and her eldest daughter, and said, 'Good mother, you are poor and burdened with children. If you will agree to what I shall say to you, you will be rich. I have this son who is, as you see, in form a pig, and I would fain marry him to your eldest daughter. Do not consider him, but think of the king and of me, and remember that your daughter will inherit this whole kingdom when the king and I shall be dead.' When the young girl listened to the words of the queen she was greatly disturbed in her mind and blushed red for shame, and then said that on no account would she listen to the queen's proposition; but the poor mother besought her so pressingly that at last she yielded. When the pig came home one day, all covered with dirt as usual, his mother said to him, 'My son, we have found for you the wife you desire.' And then she caused to be brought in the bride, who by this time had been robed in sumptuous regal attire, and presented her to the pig prince. When he saw how lovely and desirable she was he was filled with joy, and, all foul and dirty as he was, jumped round about her, endeavoring by his pawing and nuzzling to show some sign of his affection. But she, when she found he was soiling her beautiful dress, thrust him aside; whereupon the pig said to her, 'Why do you push me thus? Have I not had these garments made for you myself?' Then she answered disdainfully, 'No, neither you nor any other of the whole kingdom of hogs has done this thing.' And when the time for going to bed was come the young girl said to herself, 'What am I to do with this foul beast? This very night, while he lies in his first sleep, I will kill him.' The pig prince, who was not far off, heard these words, but said nothing, and when the two retired to their chamber he got into the bed, stinking and dirty as he was, and defiled the sumptuous bed with his filthy paws and snout. He lay down by his spouse, who was not long in falling to sleep, and then he struck her with his sharp hoofs and drove them into her breast so that he killed her. The next morning the queen went to visit her daughter-in-law, and to her great grief found that the pig had killed her; and when he came back from wandering about the city he said, in reply to the queen's bitter reproaches, that he had only wrought with his wife as she was minded to deal with him, and then withdrew in an ill humor. Not many days had passed before the pig prince again began to beseech the queen to allow him to marry one of the other sisters, and because the queen at first would not listen to his petition he persisted in his purpose, and threatened to ruin everything in the place if he could not have her to wife. The queen, when she heard this, went to the king and told him everything, and he made answer that perhaps it would be wiser to kill their ill-fated offspring before he might work some fatal mischief in the city. But the queen felt all the tenderness of a mother toward him, and loved him very dearly in spite of his brutal person, and could not endure the thought of being parted from him; so she summoned once more to the palace the poor woman, together with her second daughter, and held a long discourse with her, begging her the while to give her daughter in marriage. At last the girl assented to take the pig prince for a husband; but her fate was no happier than her sister's, for the bridegroom killed her, as he had killed his other bride, and then fled headlong from the palace. When he came back dirty as usual and smelling so foully that no one could approach him, the king and queen censured him gravely for the outrage he had wrought; but again he cried out boldly that if he had not killed her she would have killed him. As it had happened before, the pig in a very short time began to importune his mother again to let him have to wife the youngest sister, who was much more beautiful than either of the others; and when this request of his was refused steadily, he became more insistent than ever, and in the end began to threaten the queen's life in violent and bloodthirsty words, unless he should have given to him the young girl for his wife. The queen, when she heard this shameful and unnatural speech, was well-nigh broken hearted and like to go out of her mind; but, putting all other considerations aside, she called for the poor woman and her third daughter, who was named Meldina, and thus addressed her, 'Meldina, my child, I should be greatly pleased if you would take the pig prince for a husband; pay no regard to him, but to his father and to me; then, if you will be prudent and bear patiently with him, you may be the happiest woman in the world.' To this speech Meldina answered, with a grateful smile upon her face, that she was quite content to do as the queen bade her, and thanked her humbly for deigning to choose her as a daughter-in-law; for, seeing that she herself had nothing in the world, it was indeed great good fortune that she, a poor girl, should become the daughter-in-law of a potent sovereign. The queen, when she heard this modest and amiable reply, could not keep back her tears for the happiness she felt; but she feared all the time that the same fate might be in store for Meldina as her sisters. When the new bride had been clothed in rich attire and decked with jewels, and was awaiting the bridegroom, the pig prince came in, filthier and more muddy than ever; but she spread out her rich gown and besought him to lie down by her side. Whereupon the queen bade her to thrust him away, but to this she would not consent, and spoke thus to the queen, 'There are three wise sayings, gracious lady, which I remember to have heard. The first is that it is folly to waste time in searching for that which cannot be found. The second is that we should believe nothing we may hear, except those things which bear the marks of sense and reason. The third is that, when once you have got possession of some rare and precious treasure, prize it well and keep a firm hold upon it.' When the maiden had finished speaking, the pig prince, who had been wide awake and had heard all that she had said, got up, kissed her on the face and neck and bosom and shoulders with his tongue, and she was not backward in returning his caresses; so that he was fired with a warm love for her. As soon as the time for retiring for the night had come, the bride went to bed and awaited her unseemly spouse, and, as soon as he came, she raised the coverlet and bade him lie near to her and put his head upon the pillow, covering him carefully with the bedclothes and drawing the curtains so that he might feel no cold. When morning had come the pig got up and ranged abroad to pasture, as was his wont, and very soon after the queen went to the bride's chamber, expecting to find that she had met with the same fate as her sisters; but when she saw her lying in the bed, all defiled with mud as it was, and looking pleased and contented, she thanked God for this favor, that her son had at last found a spouse according to his liking. One day, soon after this, when the pig prince was conversing pleasantly with his wife, he said to her, 'Meldina, my beloved wife, if I could be fully sure that you could keep a secret, I would now tell you one of mine; something I have kept hidden for many years. I know you to be very prudent and wise, and that you love me truly; so I wish to make you the sharer of my secret.' 'You may safely tell it to me, if you will,' said Meldina, 'for I promise never to reveal it to anyone without your consent.' Whereupon, being now sure of his wife's discretion and fidelity, her straightway shook off from his body the foul and dirty skin of the pig, and stood revealed as a handsome and well shaped young man, and all that night rested closely folded in the arms of his beloved wife. But he charged her solemnly to keep silence about this wonder she had seen, for the time had not yet come for his complete delivery from this misery. So when he left the bed he donned the dirty pig's hid once more. I leave you to imagine for yourselves how great was the great joy of Meldina when she discovered that, instead of a pig, she had gained a handsome and gallant young prince for a husband. Not long after this she proved to with child, and when the time her delivery came she gave birth to a fair and shapely boy. The joy of the king and queen was unbounded, especially when they found that the newborn child had the form of a human being and not that of a beast. But the burden of the strange and weighty secret which her husband had confided to her pressed heavily upon Meldina, and one day she went to her mother-in-law and said, 'Gracious queen, when first I married your son I believed I was married to a beast, but not I find that you have given me the comeliest, the worthiest, and the most gallant young man ever born into the world to be my husband. For know that when he comes into my chamber to lie by my side, he casts off his dirty hide and leaves it on the ground, and is changed into a graceful handsome youth. No one could believe this marvel save they saw it with their own eyes.' When the queen heard these words she deemed that her daughter-in-law must be jesting with her, but Meldina still persisted that what she said was true. And when the queen demanded to know how she might witness with her own eyes the truth of this thing, Meldina replied, 'Come to my chamber tonight, when we shall be in our first sleep; the door will be open, and you will find that what I tell you is the truth.' That same night, when the looked-for time had come, and all were gone to rest, the queen let some torches be kindled and went, accompanied by the king, to the chamber of her son, and when she had entered she saw the pig's skin lying on the floor in the corner of the room, and having gone to the bedside, found therein a handsome young man in whose arms Meldina was lying. And when they saw this, the delight of the king and queen was very great, and the king gave order that before anyone should leave the chamber the pig's hide should be torn to shreds. So great was their joy over the recovery of their son that they well-nigh died thereof. And King Galeotto, when he saw that he had so fine a son, and a grandchild likewise, laid aside his diadem and his royal robes, and advanced to his place his son, whom he let be crowned with the greatest pomp, and who was ever afterwards known as King Pig. Thus, to the great contentment of all the people, the young king began his reign, and he lived long and happily with Meldina his beloved wife. translated by W. G. Waters (London: Privately printed for members of the Society of Bibliophiles, 1901), vol. We know almost nothing about the personal life of Giovanni Francesco [also spelled Gianfrancesco] Straparola (ca. 1480 - ca. 1557). His two-volume work Le piacevoli notti (1550-1553), called in English The Facetious Nights of Straparola or simply The Nights of Straparola, contains some 75 novellas and fairy tales, some of oriental origin. Obviously patterning his collection after Boccaccio's Decamerone, Straparola depicts here thirteen nights of revelry in a luxurious villa on the island of Murano near Venice. The participants add to the entertainment by telling one another stories. Included are tales of magic and the supernatural as well as bawdy jokes and anecdotes.

A table stood in the connecting tunnel, and seated on the table was a fellow with claws on his fingers and on his feet. In front of him there was a tinderbox. The fellow gave the tinderbox to the cobbler's apprentice, as well as copper, silver, and gold. The apprentice then had the witch pull him back up. He gave the copper to the witch, but kept the silver, gold, and the tinderbox for himself. He went on his way, and with the gold and silver he was suddenly a wealthy man. Whenever he struck a light with the tinderbox two giants appeared before him and said, 'What is my lord's command?' With time he came to the royal city, and one night he struck a light with the tinderbox. When the two giants appeared and asked, 'What is my lord's command?' he answered, 'I want you to bring me the princess in her bed.' Not long afterward they brought the princess in her bed to the apprentice. From that time onward the same thing happened every night. When the king learned from the princess what was happening to her in the night, he commanded that a loosely bound bag of peas be fastened beneath her bed. By following the peas that fell out, one could discover where the princess was being taken each night. However, underway the giants noticed the bag of peas, and after they had brought the princess back to her room, they gathered up all the peas, so that no one could see where she had been. They did the same thing the next night when the king had a loosely bound bag of lentils fastened beneath her bed, and not a single lentil remained in the street. The next night when the giants brought the princess's bed to the apprentice, they said sadly, 'My lord, your last hour has struck. The king had a cow's bladder filled with blood fastened under the princess's bed, and we giants are not able to wipe up the blood that dripped out of the cow's bladder. In the morning the king will learn where the princess has been during the night, and he will have you executed.' Indeed, the next morning soldiers forced their way into the apprentice's room and took him prisoner. A golden scaffold was constructed on which he was to die. However, before he lay his head on the scaffold, he asked to be permitted to smoke one last pipeful of tobacco before his end. This wish was granted him, and he pulled the tinderbox from his pocket and struck a flame. The two giants appeared immediately, asking, 'What is my lord's command?' He commanded them to capture the king and throw him into prison. And thus the cobbler's apprentice at once became king. He had the old king beheaded and married the princess.", "title": "The Giants and the Tinderbox", "id": 657}
{"label": "1365", "text": "Once upon a time, though it was not in my time nor in your time nor in anybody else's time, there lived a cobbler named Tom and his wife named Joan. And they lived fairly happily together, except that whatever Tom did Joan did the opposite, and whatever Joan thought Tom thought quite contrary-wise. When Tom wanted beef for dinner Joan liked pork, and if Joan wanted to have chicken Tom would like to have duck. And so it went on all the time. Now it happened that one day Joan was cleaning up the kitchen and, turning suddenly, she knocked two or three pots and pans together and broke them all. So Tom, who was working in the front room, came and asked Joan, 'What's all this? What have you been doing?' Now Joan had got the pair of scissors in her hand, and sooner than tell him what had really happened she said, 'I cut these pots and pans into pieces with my scissors.' 'What?' said Tom, 'Cut pottery with your scissors, you nonsensical woman; you can't do it!' 'I tell you I did with my scissors!' 'You couldn't.' 'I did.' 'Couldn't.' 'Did.' At last Tom got so angry that he seized Joan by the shoulders and shoved her out of the house and said, 'If you don't tell me how you broke those pots and pans I'll throw you into the river.' But Joan kept on saying, 'It was with the scissors.' And Tom got so enraged that at last he took her to the bank of the river and said, 'Now for the last time, will you tell me the truth? How did you break those pots and pans?' 'With the scissors.' And with that he threw her into the river, and she sank once, and she sank twice, and just before she was about to sink for the third time she put her hand up into the air, out of the water, and made a motion with her first and middle finger as if she were moving the scissors. So Tom saw it was no use to try to persuade her to do anything but what she wanted. So he rushed up the stream and met a neighbor who said, 'Tom, Tom, what are you running for?' 'Oh, I want to find Joan; she fell into the river just in front of our house, and I am afraid she is going to be drowned.' 'But,' said the neighbor, 'you're running up stream.' 'Well,' said Tom, 'Joan always went contrary-wise whatever happened.' And so he never found her in time to save her.", "title": "Scissors", "id": 658}

{"label": "737", "text": "It is believed that on Saint Andrew's Eve, Saint Thomas's Eve, Christmas Eve, and New Year's Eve a maiden can conjure up and see her future beloved. To do so she must set a table for two, but no forks can be included with the untensils. Whatever is left behind by the lover must be carefully set aside. Later he will return to the person who has it and love her passionately. However, he must not see the object, for it would remind him of the torment he endured that night when he had been overcome by supernatural powers. Great misfortune would follow. Once in Austria a beautiful maiden wanted to see her future beloved. At midnight, following the necessary rituals, a shoemaker with a dagger appeared to her. He threw the dagger in her direction and then disappeared. She picked up the dagger and and locked it in her chest. Soon afterward the shoemaker came to her and asked her to marry him. Some years after their marriage, on a Sunday after mass, she went to her chest to get some handwork for the following day. Her husband came up to her just as she was opening the chest, and he wanted to see what was inside. She tried to keep him away, but he pushed her aside, looked into the chest, and saw the lost dagger. He picked it up and demanded to know how she came to have the dagger that he had lost some time ago. Frightened and confused, she confessed that this was the dagger that he had left with her that night when she had magically seen him. With anger he shouted at her: 'Whore! So you are the hussy who frightend me so terribly that night!' And he stabbed her through the heart with the dagger. This story is told at various places and about different individuals. For example, there is an oral account about a hunter who left his hunting knife. When his wife was recovering from childbirth she sent him to her chest to fetch some bedding, not thinking about the magical item that was there. He found the hunting knife and killed her with it.", "title": "Saint Andrew's Eve", "id": 660}
{"label": "1319", "text": "'Eggs of other birds there are,' he said, 'and I have seen them; but what bird's eggs are these eggs? These must be mare's eggs.' So he looked at the grain-seller, and said: 'Are these eggs mare's eggs?' The man instantly cocked his ears; and perceiving that he was a simpleton, answered: 'Yes, these eggs are mare's eggs.' 'What is the price?' inquired the countryman. 'One hundred rupees apiece,' said the grain-seller. The simple weaver took out his bag of money, and, counting out the price, bought one of the melons and carried it off. As he went along the road, he began to say to himself: 'When I get home I will put this egg in a warm corner of my house, and by-and-by a foal will be born, and when the foal is big enough, I shall mount it and ride to the house of my father-in-law. Won't he be astonished?' As the day, however, was unusually hot, he stopped at a pool of water to bathe. But first of all he deposited the melon most carefully in the middle of a low bush, and then he proceeded to undress himself. His garments were not half laid aside, when out from the bush sprang a hare, and the weaver, snatching up part of his clothing while the rest hung about his legs in disorder, made desperate efforts to chase and overtake the hare, crying out: 'Ah, there goes my foal! Wo, old boy -- wo, wo!' But he ran in vain, for the hare easily escaped, and was soon out of sight. The poor weaver reconciled himself to his loss as best he could. 'Kismet!' cried he; 'and as for the egg, it is of course of no use now, and not worth returning for, since the foal has left it.' So he made the best of his way home, and said to his wife: 'O wife, I have had a great loss this day. 'Why,' said she, 'what have you done?' 'I paid one hundred rupees for a mare's egg,' replied he; 'but while I stopped on the road to bathe, the foal jumped out and ran away.' 'Ah, what a pity!' cried the wife; 'if you had only brought the foal here, I would have got on his back, and ridden him to my father's house!' Hearing this, the weaver fell into a rage, and, pulling a stick out of his loom, began to belabour his wife, saying: 'What! you would break the back of a young foal? Ah! you monster, let me break yours.' After this he went out, and began to lament his loss to his friends and neighbours, warning them all: 'If any of you should see a stray foal, don't forget to let me know.' To the village herdsmen especially he related his wonderful story: how the foal came out of the egg, and ran away, and would perhaps be found grazing on the common-lands somewhere. One or two of the farmers, however, to whom the tale was repeated, said: 'What is this nonsense? Mares never have eggs. Where did you put this egg of yours?' 'I put my egg in a bush,' said the weaver, near the tank on the way to the town.' 'Come and show us!' cried the farmers. 'All right,' assented the weaver; 'come along.' When they arrived at the spot, the melon was found untouched in the middle of the bush. 'Here it is,' cried the weaver; 'here's my mare's egg. This is the thing out of which my foal jumped.' The farmers turned the melon over and over, and said: 'But what part of this egg did the foal jump out of?' So the weaver took the egg, and began to examine it. 'Out of this,' cried one of the farmers, snatching back the melon, 'no foal ever jumped. You are a simpleton, and you have been cheated! We'll show you what the foals are.' So he smashed the melon on a stone, and, giving the seeds to the weaver, said: 'Here are foals enough for you;' while the farmers themselves, amid much laughter, sat down and ate up the delicious fruit.", "title": "The Weaver and the Watermelon", "id": 661}

{"label": "613", "text": "Dharmabuddhi, as soon as he had heard these words, took leave from his parents with a joyful heart, and one happy day set forth for foreign lands. Through their diligence and skill, Dharmabuddhi and P\u00c3\u00a2pabuddhi acquired great wealth on their travels. Happy, but also filled with longing, they turned homeward with their great treasure. For it is also said: For those who gain wisdom, art, and wealth in foreign lands, the absence of one hour has the length of hundreds. As they approached their city, P\u00c3\u00a2pabuddhi said to Dharmabuddhi, 'Friend, it is not prudent for us to return home with our entire treasure, for our families and relatives will want part of it. Therefore let us bury it somewhere here in the thick of the forest and take only a small part home with us. When the need arises, we can come back and get as much as we need from here. For they also say: A smart man does not show off his money, not even in small amounts, for the sight of gold will agitate even a good heart. And also: Like meat is devoured in the water by fish, on land by wild animals, and in the air by birds, he who owns money is everywhere at risk.' Upon hearing this, Dharmabuddhi said, 'Yes, my friend, that is what we will do!' After having thus buried their treasure, they both returned home and lived happily together. However, one day at midnight P\u00c3\u00a2pabuddhi went back into the forest, took the entire treasure, refilled the hole, and returned home. Then he went to Dharmabuddhi and said to him, 'Friend, each of us has a large family, and we are suffering because we have no money. Therefore, let us go to that place and get some money.' Dharmabuddhi answered, 'Yes, my friend, let us do it!' They went there and dug up the container, but it was empty. Then P\u00c3\u00a2pabuddhi struck himself on the head and cried out, 'Aha! Dharmabuddhi! You and only you have taken the money, for the hole has been filled in again. Give me my half of what you have hidden, or I will bring action against you at the king's court.' Dharmabuddhi said, 'Do not speak like that, you evildoer. I am in truth Dharmabuddhi, the one with a just heart! I would not commit such an act of thievery. After all, it is said: The person with a just heart treats another man's wife like his own mother, another man's property like a clod of earth, and all beings like himself.' Quarreling thus, they proceeded to the court where they told their stories and brought action against one another. The top judges decreed that they submit to an Ordeal of God, but P\u00c3\u00a2pabuddhi said, 'No! Such an ordeal is not just. After all, it is written: In a legal action one should seek documents. If there are no documents, then one should seek witnesses. If there are no witnesses, then wise men should prescribe an Ordeal of God. In this matter the goddess of the tree will serve as my witness. She will declare which one of us is a thief and which one an honest man.' To this they all replied, 'What you say is right, for it is also written: An Ordeal of God is inappropriate where there is a witness, be he even a man of the lowest caste, to say nothing of the case where he is a god. We too are very curious about this case. Tomorrow morning we shall go with you to that place in the forest.' In the meanwhile, P\u00c3\u00a2pabuddhi returned home and said to his father, 'Father! I have stolen this money from Dharmabuddhi, and one word from you will secure it for us. Without your word, we shall lose it, and I shall lose my life as well.' The father said, 'Child, just tell what I have to say in order to secure it!' P\u00c3\u00a2pabuddhi said, 'Father, in thus and such a place there is a large mimosa tree. It has a hollow trunk. Go hide yourself in it. When I swear an oath there tomorrow morning, then you must reply that Dharmabuddhi is the thief.' Having made these arrangements, the next morning P\u00c3\u00a2pabuddhi bathed himself, put on a clean shirt, and went to the mimosa tree with Dharmabuddhi and the judges. Once there, he spoke with a piercing voice, 'Sun and moon, wind and fire, heaven and earth, heart and mind, day and night, sunrise and sunset, all of these, like dharma, know a man's deeds. Sublime goddess of the forest, reveal which of us is the thief!' Then P\u00c3\u00a2pabuddhi's father, who was standing in the hollow trunk of the mimosa tree, said, 'Listen! Listen! The money was taken away by Dharmabuddhi!' Having heard this, the king's servants, their eyes opened wide with amazement, searched in their law books for an appropriate punishment for Dharmabuddhi's theft of the money. While they were thus engaged, Dharmabuddhi himself surrounded the tree's opening with flammable material, and set it on fire. When it was well ablaze, P\u00c3\u00a2pabuddhi's father emerged from the hollow tree. His eyes streaming, he cried out bitterly. 'What is this?' they asked him. He confessed everything, and then died. The king's servants forthwith hanged P\u00c3\u00a2pabuddhi from a branch of the mimosa tree, but they had only words of praise for Dharmabuddhi. Although the original author's or compiler's name is unknown, an Arabic translation from about 750 AD attributes the Panchatantra to a wise man called Bidpai, which is probably a Sanskrit word meaning 'court scholar.' The fables of the Panchatantra found their way to Europe through oral folklore channels and by way of Persian and Arabic translations.

{"label": "333", "text": "You know the tale of poor Little Red Riding-Hood, that the wolf deceived and devoured, with her cake, her little butter can, and her grandmother. Well, the true story happened quite differently, as we know now. And first of all the little girl was called and is still called Little Golden-Hood; secondly, it was not she, nor the good grand-dame, but the wicked wolf who was, in the end, caught and devoured. Only listen. The story begins something like the tale. There was once a little peasant girl, pretty and nice as a star in its season. Her real name was Blanchette, but she was more often called Little Golden-Hood, on account of a wonderful little cloak with a hood, gold- and fire-colored, which she always had on. This little hood was given her by her grandmother, who was so old that she did not know her age; it ought to bring her good luck, for it was made of a ray of sunshine, she said. And as the good old woman was considered something of a witch, everyone thought the little hood rather bewitched too. And so it was, as you will see. One day the mother said to the child, 'Let us see, my Little Golden-Hood, if you know now how to find your way by yourself. You shall take this good piece of cake to your grandmother for a Sunday treat tomorrow. You will ask her how she is, and come back at once, without stopping to chatter on the way with people you don't know. Do you quite understand?' 'I quite understand,' replied Blanchette gaily. And off she went with the cake, quite proud of her errand. But the grandmother lived in another village, and there was a big wood to cross before getting there. At a turn of the road under the trees, suddenly, 'Who goes there?' 'Friend wolf.' He had seen the child start alone, and the villain was waiting to devour her; when at the same moment he perceived some woodcutters who might observe him, and he changed his mind. Instead of falling upon Blanchette he came frisking up to her like a good dog. ''Tis you! my nice Little Golden-Hood,' said he. So the little girl stops to talk with the wolf, who, for all that, she did not know in the least. 'You know me, then!' said she. 'What is your name?' 'My name is friend wolf. And where are you going thus, my pretty one, with your little basket on your arm?' 'I am going to my grandmother, to take her a good piece of cake for her Sunday treat tomorrow.' 'And where does she live, your grandmother?' 'She lives at the other side of the wood, in the first house in the village, near the windmill, you know.' 'Ah! yes! I know now,' said the wolf. 'Well, that's just where I'm going; I shall get there before you, no doubt, with your little bits of legs, and I'll tell her you're coming to see her; then she'll wait for you.' Thereupon the wolf cuts across the wood, and in five minutes arrives at the grandmother's house. He knocks at the door: toc, toc. No answer. He knocks louder. Nobody. Then he stands up on end, puts his two forepaws on the latch and the door opens. Not a soul in the house. The old woman had risen early to sell herbs in the town, and she had gone off in such haste that she had left her bed unmade, with her great nightcap on the pillow. 'Good!' said the wolf to himself, 'I know what I'll do.' He shuts the door, pulls on the grandmother's nightcap down to his eyes, then he lies down all his length in the bed and draws the curtains. In the meantime the good Blanchette went quietly on her way, as little girls do, amusing herself here and there by picking Easter daisies, watching the little birds making their nests, and running after the butterflies which fluttered in the sunshine. At last she arrives at the door. Knock, knock. 'Who is there?' says the wolf, softening his rough voice as best he can. 'It's me, Granny, your Little Golden-Hood. I'm bringing you a big piece of cake for your Sunday treat tomorrow.' 'Press your finger on the latch, then push and the door opens.' 'Why, you've got a cold, Granny,' said she, coming in. 'Ahem! a little, a little . . .' replies the wolf, pretending to cough. 'Shut the door well, my little lamb. Put your basket on the table, and then take off your frock and come and lie down by me. You shall rest a little.' The good child undresses, but observe this! She kept her little hood upon her head. When she saw what a figure her Granny cut in bed, the poor little thing was much surprised. 'Oh!' cries she, 'how like you are to friend wolf, Grandmother!' 'That's on account of my nightcap, child,' replies the wolf. 'Oh! what hairy arms you've got, Grandmother!' 'All the better to hug you, my child.' 'Oh! what a big tongue you've got, Grandmother!' 'All the better for answering, child.' 'Oh ! what a mouthful of great white teeth you have, Grandmother!' 'That's for crunching little children with!' And the wolf opened his jaws wide to swallow Blanchette. But she put down her head crying, 'Mamma! Mamma!' and the wolf only caught her little hood. Thereupon, oh dear! oh dear! he draws back, crying and shaking his jaw as if he had swallowed red-hot coals. It was the little fire-colored hood that had burnt his tongue right down his throat. The little hood, you see, was one of those magic caps that they used to have in former times, in the stories, for making oneself invisible or invulnerable. So there was the wolf with his throat burnt, jumping off the bed and trying to find the door, howling and howling as if all the dogs in the country were at his heels. Just at this moment the grandmother arrives, returning from the town with her long sack empty on her shoulder. 'Ah, brigand!' she cries, 'wait a bit!' Quickly she opens her sack wide across the door, and the maddened wolf springs in head downwards. It is he now that is caught, swallowed like a letter in the post. For the brave old dame shuts her sack, so; and she runs and empties it in the well, where the vagabond, still howling, tumbles in and is drowned. 'Ah, scoundrel! you thought you would crunch my little grandchild! Well, tomorrow we will make her a muff of your skin, and you yourself shall be crunched, for we will give your carcass to the dogs.' Thereupon the grandmother hastened to dress poor Blanchette, who was still trembling with fear in the bed. 'Well,' she said to her, 'without my little hood where would you be now, darling?' And, to restore heart and legs to the child, she made her eat a good piece of her cake, and drink a good draught of wine, after which she took her by the hand and led her back to the house. And then, who was it who scolded her when she knew all that had happened? It was the mother. But Blanchette promised over and over again that she would never more stop to listen to a wolf, so that at last the mother forgave her. And Blanchette, the Little Golden-Hood, kept her word. And in fine weather she may still be seen in the fields with her pretty little hood, the color of the sun. But to see her you must rise early. 1895), pp.", "title": "The True History of Little Golden-Hood", "id": 665}
