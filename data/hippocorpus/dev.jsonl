We were in a rented room in the library that is reserved for parties when my son came up to me to show me he had a \"bump\" in his groin area. The was a large lump but I didn't think too much of it. I was thinking he is a dirty boy, loves to be outside, he is rough, he touches everything. I am sure he just got an infection somehow. We took him to the doctor and they thought he also had an infection. They gave him an antibiotic. It did not work, the lymph nodes just got bigger. They tried a different antibiotic and a day later they felt even bigger. So our doctor sent us for an ultrasound. That came back with extremely enlarged lymph nodes. So he wanted a ct. While we were waiting for insurance to approve the ct, he noticed swollen lymph nodes on his neck. Now the doctor wanted a second ct of his neck and feared the worst..lymphoma. Not just any lymphoma, but an aggressive later stage lymphoma. After the ct revealed extremely swollen lymph nodes from the neck down the trachea to the groin the doctor told us he was 85% certain it was lymphoma and sent us for a biopsy. The surgeon disagreed with the doctor that is was lymphoma. He was convinced given the history that it was cat scratch fever. Sure enough, the results came back and it was cat scratch fever. Not just cat scratch fever, but the levels of this bacteria in his system was off the charts!", "label": "retold", "group": "D13ARTNZ"}

My daughter and I were involved in a car accident on a morning that was already not so pleasant. I had barely gotten any sleep the night before because I had been up crying my eyes out. My cousin (who is more like a brother to me) had been involved in a very terrible car accident and was on life support. My emotions were everywhere. I gathered my daughter because I didn't want her to be late going to school. Once I got in my truck, I realized that it would not start. I had to call my mother to borrow her BRAND NEW truck, which she had just purchased two weeks prior. She came to my house and I dropped her off at her house and was making my way to my daughters school. On the four way highway, my daughter and I were in the left lane. The light turned green and I then realized that a car ahead of me was making a left turn and yielding oncoming traffic. I turned on my signal light to get into the right lane since there was no traffic coming behind me. As soon as I switched over and started to move past some of the other cars in the left lane. As I was passing the cars that were in the left lane, one of the cars came over in the right lane hitting me and my daughter. I was knocked off of the road and onto the sidewalk. I had to stay there for a moment because my daughter was yelling and screaming and my nerves were shook. I was able to move the truck from off the sidewalk and park behind the young lady who hit me and police were called. My nerves were so shaken up because I had got into an accident and for one moment my whole life flashed before my eyes, was I about to end up like my cousin?? I was also worried about the fact that I had crashed my mom's new truck which was her first concern when I called her; leaving my child and I as an afterthought. With my daughter in my arms trying to comfort her, I began to cry. Everything was going wrong in my life at this moment, and I had no one. The young lady who hit me had called her older sister there to be with her; meanwhile I had no one. I texted my boyfriend who was at work, but he gets no service in certain places..... everything was a mess. However, the young lady was very nice and offered to pay for all of the damages because she was a new young driver who didn't want to increase her insurance. Her sister saw how upset I was and gave me a hug which turned out to be very comforting. It turns out the sister worked at the local hospital and remembered seeing the ambulance bringing my cousin in the day prior. She sent her love and prayers to my family and my daughter and I went to the hospital to be examined; my daughter was fine, I had minor aches for a few days, and my cousin died three weeks later", "label": "recalled", "group": "42462G6C"}

She's a New Englander through and through but feels that some of the major states, like Mass and NY are too busy for her. Anyway, she arrived the Friday and would be staying for a week. We spent the first day or two getting her settled in and showing my mom how we lived. How we liked to cook, how we used our little firepit outside our home and how much space our dog had to run around. She seemed to be quite happy staying with us. We went out one night for dinner and she loved the city so much we stayed out, getting drinks and bar hopping for hours. I think she really took too and enjoy the time being in a new city and state and being around different people. After the days rolled by and we spent our evenings together she got really involved. She cooked in our kitchen, made a meal for us, we drank lots of wine and watched movies on the couch. We just enjoyed the cool evenings of summer out on our patio, by the fire, cooking outside and having fun. After the week ended and she was preparing to head back, she asked about coming back with my dad when he could get off work for a weekend. This was thrilling, it was amazing to have my mother be so excited about joining us out here and wanting to spend more time with us. We made plans and they'll be coming out in just a few days.

That was a long time ago, though, and that probably made it easier for me to settle with the fact that I could not even make time to attend her funeral. I was surprised by how he handled my rejection well enough, but also how I was even able to accept it afterwards. I guess I'm realizing a part of myself that lacks the empathy that I wish I had. So, running through events quickly in my head, I probably was thinking about the significance or connection I had to the event but instead should have been thinking about how my friend would feel about my attendance. I think this event gave me a good perspective on what I am and what I think I should become. I need to be able to hold the people that I care for, and the people that care for me, closer than I do.

This dates back to the early 2000s when I first became a fan of theirs. I missed a lot of their tours leading up to when they released their sixth album. They decided to do what would be a 20th Anniversary tour of their debut album. My brother-in-law had decided to purchase tickets for the both of us and I was stoked. They toured fairly close and it was a great opportunity to get pit tickets. What was really exciting was the fact that this was my first metal show ever. It was a long time coming and I was also interested in the opening bands that would be touring with Slipknot. The tickets were purchased a few months ahead of time at a sale price and that was awesome. We traveled a couple of hours to the arena where the concert was at and got to hang out with some interesting people before the show began. I was pumped up to finally enjoy Slipknot's music live. Behemoth opened the show with darkness and a lot of bass to their heavy style of music. It was the first time I had ever been in a pit and it was cool to bump around and just let loose with other people. Gojira played after that with their progressive style that really rocked. Volbeat played third and were soft compared to the other bands, but they got my hyped up. And then the Slipknot curtain was being set up as we were taking a bathroom break. We come back and get positioned on the floor near the pit again. It was extremely exciting and I had goosebumps as the intro to one of their earlier albums started playing. The curtain dropped and they started playing an older track which was raw and brutal. I was jumping and screaming the whole time while my brother-in-law lost his voice singing some of our favorite tunes we always jammed to. I don't remember the last time a concert really got my pumped up, but this one sure did the job well. Slipknot's new music they played live was incredible and some of the songs off the new album sounded super good live. It was probably the best show I had been to and I really got a shot of energy from experiencing it.

The day I won that jackpot I had not reached that level yet, as it was with my first dollar that I won. I was really impressed when the machine had all of a kind, making me win the jackpot. Because I bought everyone drinks that day, some bonds have been established with other gamblers. I have made new friends on the gambling machines. There is a lady who is always there present who asks me how I am doing on the machines and gets glad when I win. This may all seem trivial, but where I live there is honestly not much to do other than spend time drinking and gambling or go to church. These are the main forms of entertainment and socialization. I see playing at the slot machines as a form of entertainment and a little escape from life's problems. Since that day, I have won some small jackpots but nothing big, so I have not bought everyone drinks with my jackpots since then. Still, I think that being generous and sharing with others when I win very comforting and generates bonds with people who I have probably not met if I did not go there and play. Even when gambling seems to be a risky move, compared to going to church, going every once in a while to this bar and playing the slot machines seems to be a good way to make connections and meet new people. Although gambling may be a vice, as with all things, if done with moderation and with the intention to make new friends and connections instead of looking it as a means to make a quick buck seems to be the best approach. I wish there were better success stories for me with more impact, but still it's nice to see that I can make new friends and establish bonds with something as trivial as playing the slot machines.", "label": "retold", "group": "BPM9FI3M"}

We were absolutely blown away with how delicious Hungarian food is. We had delicious stew and soup. I was worried initially about how the food would be. I do not eat meat, and I read prior that Hungarians love their meat, but I had no trouble finding vegetarian options. The next day on our trip, we saw the beautiful Parliament building, and a beautiful castle. I remember walking up many stairs and getting tired in the hot, summer sun. Suddenly though, we reached an archway that took us to the end of the tunnel. There was sunlight peaking through and some of the most beautiful architecture I had ever seen. I saw beautiful mosaics, and a cobblestone square that overlooked the entire city of Budapest. Perfectly situated was a bar where we could sit down and look out at the view of the city and parliament building on the other side of the water. It was absolutely breathtaking and my favorite part of the trip. A close second for my favorite part of the trip was a sunset boat ride we took that allowed us to later see the lit up buildings at night.

After that, we went to their bowling alley that had drinks/food/etc, we got a little tipsy and bowled for a few hours.  Following that, we headed back to the hotel to relax and play a board game (we ended up playing Codenames) while we talked.  The next day we went to the park, which ended up being Magic Kingdom, and we went on some rides.  We also got some food and drink there as well, then we hung around and watched the little parade they do.  We stayed a few hours after the park closed since hotel guests were able to do that and then we hit some of the bigger rides again (Splash Mountain and Space Mountain).  After that, we headed back to the hotel and rested again.  The final day we were there was just hanging around the hotel room/outdoor area and just taking it easy.

His brother, now 3 years old, had just completed his second year in the spring and had now moved on to his next program elsewhere. My wife and I were very excited to see our youngest get to experience the school and its teachers, but we were also nervous because the temperment of both boys has shown they are very different. Our oldest is adventurous to the point of being reckless. He is now very self-sufficient and communicates his needs. Our youngest tends to be very needy, and clings to me and his mother. We had flashbacks to the first few days of dropping off our other son and he would cry terribly at first. We had our youngest all dressed and his bag packed with changes of clothes, diapers, and blankets for napping with. We drove on the expressway through downtown and tried to explain what he could expect from the day. We tried to tell him that he would be meeting his new teachers and that he would get to do new activities, read stories, and meet new friends. And then we would be ready to pick him up soon. When we got to school, we parked out front and I helped get him out of his car seat. We had him walk on the sidewalk, holding my hand, and he held onto his own lunchbox. We took a moment to pose him in front of the school's sidewalk sign (the same place we snapped a picture of our other son on his first day). Spirits seemed high, so we entered the classroom. It was busy, yet quiet - several other families were sitting near the cubbies getting their kids to change into their indoor shoes, hang up their belongings, and part ways. Our son seemed to take to it, but was definitely clinging close to us. When it was time for us to go, we led him to the entrance of the classroom and had him hold hands with one of his teachers who led him to where the other children were. He looked back at us with tears in his eyes and started bawling. We knew it would be better to make a quick exit, rather than prolong this. We got back in the car with mixed emotions and drove off. By the time I had arrived to work, the teacher had shared out a picture of our son doing a few of the activities at school. He looked a bit weapy, but was smiling in the pictures and I remember that making me feel so good for him and glad that he was safe, happy, and cared for.", "label": "retold", "group": "YOY59S70"}

I rented a hall out since there was going to be a mixture of family and friends and lots of noise with the music playing. The decorations were set up perfectly as you would imagine. We also had drink and appetizers. The night started off right as more people showed up then expected. We danced, played a few games and socialized. The biggest surprise had to be a couple of cousins that we have not seen in a while showed up. I had planned this as another surprise. When they showed up we really begin to party. Catching up and talking led us to not want the night to end. The hall was only rented for a few hours so when it was time to go we had the after party at our house. This is when the night really took off. We started drinking more alcohol and things got crazy. Nothing bad happen it was all positive energy, but a room full of drunk people is always full of laughs if the energy is right. I can recall a soul train line that we did, and that went on for a long time. That had to be one of the many highlight of this night.

We have always had great chemistry together and shared many interests, so it made sense. We also appeared to be very much attracted to each other.

It wasn't working. I looked online for some suggestions. This was a first for both my wife and I. I found one post advising to have the child sit on the seat and walk the bike themselves, then when they have enough momentum, start pedaling. This method made total sense to me. It seemed to teach them the natural motions while still being safe. My son tried this method a few times. He was starting to get the balance down that he needed.

It had military action figures on all sides, and was both chocolate and vanilla flavors at different levels. I even saw oreos and peanut butter cups on there, which are my two favorite snacks. Lately we have been talking on the phone a lot about me being deployed, so it was touching to receive such a big cake. I know Brian's brother served multiple tours a while back, so he understands what it means when a deployment is looming. Aside from the crazy cake, we had tons of food on his new industrial sized grill. He bought three types of burgers, tons of brats, hot dogs, and all the vegan options available.

At the end of last academic year, I realized that I have been drinking way too much and my life was out of control and I was neglecting my family as well as my work responsibilities. My work and family had become a nuisance and inconvenience to my drinking and drug using. One particular Friday night, 77 days ago I was out drinking with friends at the local bar and I was ready to completely commit to leaving my family and being a full time drug user. My wife texted to say she was well-aware of my drug using and she was at the point of leaving. In a typical impulsive and poisoned way, I was fine with that. At the bar, a friend and I were chatting while my friend waited on a call to re-supply his drug stash. This re-up was bigger than normal. Upon getting the call, we headed to the spot to adquire the drugs. This was normal protocol. Once obtained, I got my small share and was happy to hang out with him for the rest of the night, while he made the rounds delivering the newly obtained powerful substance. For some reason, I had a terrible stomach ache and requested that he just drop me off at the bar downtown and scoop me up for on the way to the next location as he was going to be moving all around the town. He agreed and I went back to, hurting with a stomach and content that I had my drugs. As the night progressed, I felt better, so I reached out to my friend to check his stats and have him pick me back up. I text and called many times, but did not receive any answers. This was odd, but I was feeling quite good so I did not let it bother me. At that time, another friend invited me to go by his house. Since several hours had past, I thought it would be a good idea to go to another place. As we were driving to my friends house, we saw the flashing blue and white lights of many police cars. As we drew closer, I noticed my other friend's vechicle being placed on the back of a tow truck. Immediately, I knew what happened and felt a pull at the core of my being.

It was great seeing the entire family altogether in one place, as it doesn't happen very often. I pondered what kind of role I would play in my nephew's future, if I would be very involved or just a distant relative he would see during the holidays. My brother and I are not very close, but obviously for events like this we would have to be present. Regardless, I'm not sure if this child is enough to bring our relationship any closer. Seeing new life is one of the biggest encouragements to make someone reflect on their own life, and what is most important to them.", "label": "retold", "group": "FAOS3M2Z"}

This of course did not just happen today, it was over a span of days. The father to my recently born child makes me feel like I can't do anything without first telling him, even though we are not dating. The days would start normal, I would send him a morning picture of the outfit the child was wearing that day and keep him updated with how he slept through the night. On the normal days that would be the end of the conversation, he'd ask a few more questions if he needed more information about how the child is doing and I would answer. Some days he would bring up the conversation of why we can't just be together, and that he doesn't understand why I would just give up. I would explain to him over and over again that we are just two different people that don't work and its in the child's best interest that we aren't together. This of course, always made him angry and I would have to remind him that our conversations need to just be about the child. He would still make comments to me, 'you look nice today, who are you getting all done up for?', 'I don't want to date anyone else', and 'who is all going, who are you with, why do you even hang out with him?'. I started feeling like I just didn't want to do anything because I didn't want to have to deal with his anger or his constant phone calls to me when I wouldn't answer him. I started not being around when he visits the baby, so he can focus on the baby and not me. He hated that, and hated even more that I wouldn't tell him who I was with, and started calling me back to back nonstop. He would say that he was only calling because he had a question about how to do the baby's bath but a call back to him told me that was a lie. His visits became fewer and then nonexistent, the only time he sees the child now is when I bring the baby to his work for a visit. I have since taken my life back into my hands, I only bring the baby by if I'm not busy when he asks me to bring the baby. I say no when he asks if he can buy me dinner for my birthday or anything else.

This event was about how I had a company that refurbished old abandoned homes and fixed them up to sell them for a higher price. One of the big reasons that my company started to go under was the fact that a serial killer had started murdering people a couple miles from the house I bought. This caused the house to sit on the market for months until the police caught the guy and by that time it was to late and I had run out of money for my business. One of the most memorable experiences I had at the time was realizing I was really down to the wire. When I had to start selling things to pay for my mortgage and electricity that was a very scary time in my life. Another memorable experience and probably the hardest was selling the tools that I had used to fix up the houses. That part was significant because that is when I had really realized that this is over and I need to start planning for what was coming. Also to try and to avoid foreclosure and bankruptcy. I am less anxious and stressed now that I am living in a smaller apartment. I still wish that I would have realized that my business was failing and I should have sold my stuff more preemptively than when I had done so. I now take more ownership for my business going under. I should have had more money saved up than I did, and I do take ownership for my company failing even though it failed under such strange circumstances. Taking ownership is significant because it lets me be able to be around others when I am going through trying times instead of trying to push the blame on others. So people will be less nervous around me. I think now I do wish I could go back and fix the mistakes that I had made but the only thing we can do is push forward. I am still saving up money to try and redo the business now that I have more knowledge than before, but time will tell what happens with that.", "label": "retold", "group": "RH42C973"}

We saw gorillas hanging out in the shade and in a different section we saw other chimps and monkeys. We walked past that and we saw giraffes. Watching the giraffes was a cool site because they got really close to us. Like one of them was looking at me and came in my direction and I thought it would actually do something to me. Then after we saw the lions and they were mostly hanging out in the shade to stay out of the heat. We continued to walk around and we saw a section with Australian animals. So we managed to see koalas in the tress and tasmanian devils. I think we also saw kangaroos but I can't remember. We spent a lot of time at the zoo maybe around 5-6 hours.

The ceremony was held outside in a lovely garden which opened up to a large field with a hugh white podium decorated so elegantly with white flowers.  The other members of the wedding party did not wear formal wear as did the groom and bride which was a nice contrast.  They instead wore ballerina wear.  The backdrop of the white chairs on the green grass was also very lovely.  It was a very sunny day so the brightly colored umbrellas that were handed out as we entered the garden as a nice touch.  The reason the event was so memorable to me was because it brought together a lot of my other cousins whom I had not seen in many years.   I have very happy to have the opportunity to see one cousin in particular that I had not seen since we were little girls.  I could not believe how much she resembled herself as a girl so there was no problems identifying her at all.  We exchanged cell phone numbers and promised to stay in touch, something I plan to do as we are both getting older every day.  The other main reason my cousin's wedding stood out for me was seeing my elderly aunt, (bride's mother) who is well into her 80's now, attend the event and enjoy the day.  She has had a few health scares and it was really good that she could attend and be a part of the festivities.  I also think it did everyone good to sit outside in the sun while breathing in air freshened by all the foliage that surrounded us.  My cousin usually goes for either very flashy men or men who depend on woman more than they should, however, this time around, she chose someone who stands on his own and who enjoys a simple life being with the one he loves.  We all can see the love they have for each other which made the day that much more enjoyable knowing that finally, she has chosen well as she moves into the middle stage of her life.", "label": "recalled", "group": "PQ3ZHWV9"}

I stopped at the red light and waited for it to turn green. Once it did, I inched forward before driving through the intersection. Almost instantly it felt like I had been shot. The sound was deafening as a pickup truck came crashing into the passenger side of my car, causing me to spin around and around. I wasn\u2019t sure what going on, and I thought that maybe I was actually dying. Once the spinning and the ringing in my ears stopped, I opened my eyes and moved around a bit. I was okay somehow. I got out of my car to examine the damage done. My car was not so lucky. The entire passenger side of it was completely caved in and the wheel had come clean off. Apparently, the driver of the pickup truck was texting on his phone and was completely oblivious to his light turning red. He sped right through the light and blind-sided me. My car was totaled completely, and I am now in search of a new car.

I learned to enjoy some parts of it, and my children made progress, but for the most part, I still hated it, and I'm afraid it showed. So when the year was over, I sat there and wondered what I was going to do next school year. I couldn't imagine homeschooling AGAIN, yet there seemed to be no other options. I checked other Christian and private schools in the area - way too expensive. I kept thinking about it, same thoughts circling in my mind. I went to get mail - and there was a letter from my kids' old school in the mailbox! At first, I thought maybe it was about some old bill I forgot to pay. I opened it... and I couldn't believe my eyes! It said the school was re-opening! With slightly lowered rates, too!! How do I describe this terrible weight instantly lifting off my shoulders?

While her life was probably a string of bad parenting mistakes and school punishments from lashing out, but it still didn't excuse her severe bullying. She would lean against her locker and glare at me as I passed by, calling out mean questions like, \"Do you have a dick?\" or \"Why are you staring at me, you fucking lesbian?\" I wasn't the only one she tormented. I would hear her lashing out at other girls, and even some of the more timid boys. Her favorite insults to hurl at the boys were often \"Faggot!\" or \"Pussy!\" Because of her aggressive behavior, she didn't have many friends but that doesn't mean that she didn't have any. Her wannabe gang was comprised of two other girls and one boy, all of which seemed to have been brought up in less than fortunate circumstances. Their crew was known for smoking pot, vandalizing, and being in detention. About 6 months ago, I finally stood up to my bully. We were in P.E. and all of the girls were in the locker room.

I think she liked me too but it was too risky to date, since she was still underage. She got married at the age of 18 and I did not see her for many years, since her husband was in the military and they moved a lot. A few years ago, a friend died and I saw her again at the friend's funeral. She was still beautiful but she was also married, this time to her second husband. It was great to see her. Then, last week in my book club, we happened to mention some things and I found out that one of our new members was her ex-husband, who I had never met.

They simply couldn't catch their breath. And then the next day was his actual funeral. The church ceremony was emotional, but the priest, a relative, did his very best to comfort us with words.

But there were rose pedals and lit candles leading up to a note and flowers.  The note had an address on it, so I quickly but carefully got dressed and did my makeup. I rushed down to the parking lot and headed to the address Alex had given me. Upon arrival I noticed there were no cars in sight. I entered the  building and was immediately escorted by a kind gentleman over to Alex. We spent the entire night laughing and joking and just all out enjoying ourselves. After  we ate he finally popped the question.  Then my entire family came from the back of the restaurant to photograph us and cry with us. I still cannot believe he flew my family all the way out to Tennessee just for our proposal. And I cant believe my family had been helping him this whole time! I am truly blessed. Since the proposal he has never failed to amaze me. Today is our wedding day and I cant wait to see what surprises are in store.", "label": "imagined", "group": "R9ROB99F"}

We've tried many different counselors, prayed over her, prayed for her, but nothing was working.  We finally agreed to let her try some medication.  While I was very concerned about giving an anti-depressant to a 19 year old child, we were kinda at our wit's end.  Living with her had gotten to the point that the entire house was on edge.  She was either asleep or yelling at us or ignoring us or being rude and nasty to every person in the house.    So the event I'm talking about happened about 6 weeks after she started taking the medication.  One day I realized that she'd come home from work and we'd had a 20 minute conversation in which she was lively, animated, and actually laughed.  I started realizing that she wasn't near as rude or mean or nasty as she used to be.  When I asked her to take out the trash, she just did it.  Without arguing, without putting it off and then forgetting, without any complaining, this was unheard of.  I was praising God and thanking Him for the nudge to try the medication with her.  It has changed her world, and therefore ours as well.  Recently she received word that although she got into her favorite college, she would not be able to go as the cost of room and board was just too much and we didn't feel like she should be drowning in student loan debt.  She was understandably upset but after about 10 minutes she started making other plans that involve living at home and going to a great school locally.  This would have never happened before the medication.  She would have retreated to her room and been in there for days, it would have crushed her, ruined her life in her eyes, and caused such upheaval that it would have taken weeks if not more for her to get back to baseline.  I'm beyond grateful for the advances in science, the doctors that know how to work with patients, and the God that provided for us all.", "label": "recalled", "group": "HSD39N0P"}

It was very hard to say goodbye but at least we had time to spend together the last few years as the cancer was not sudden and was caught early enough to treat and extend her life. My mom fought a hard fight and did not let cancer take her easily. In fact she was fighting to the very end and never let cancer define her life. I was able to be with her throughout this journey and am grateful that she was able to spend her last few years with me and my family. My daughter will always remember her grandma as a fighter and someone who never gave up.  Every time the doctors told us the end was near my mom fought through and bought herself another few months. It got to the point though that the pain was obviously wearing her down both mentally and physically and myself and my wife had to let her know it was ok to let go. That was probably the hardest part of the whole thing, telling my own mother that it was ok to stop fighting so she could be at peace. We knew that if she thought we were not ready to let go that she would keep fighting until she had nothing left. She came home from the hospital for her last few weeks and we will always cherish that time we spent as a family together. Now that she is gone I am still sad and miss her greatly but am glad that she is at peace and free of pain. She taught my daughter what it means to fight and to not give up regardless of the odds. She also taught us how to let go and say goodbye. Her funeral was not a sad affair as we gathered all of her family and friends and had a party to remember who she was as a person and what she truly meant to us all.", "label": "recalled", "group": "NQ4ZQTU8"}

The process was painful to hear about and it hit me harder than I thought it would. I was very close with my grandma and so was my mom. My mom's siblings put her on Hospice about three weeks ago and within a week she was gone. There was a lot of family drama over the passing of her and I did not agree with with how she was taken care of in the end. I feel she was pushed into the direction of death by being heavily medicated and her family members that were there were not getting her up out of bed anymore. I realize people get old and everyone's time comes but I feel like it wasn't her time yet. But you can't go back in time and she's gone now. I was able to travel with my parents and sister to Oregon to attend her funeral. It was an emotional roller coaster. The hardest day for me was when the day before her funeral I found out that there had been rules put in place by my Uncle that no grand kids were going to be able to go view my grandma and say goodbye. Because of all the drama, he wanted to hurt everyone he could that wasn't on his side. I went to the funeral home with my parents anyway in hopes that I might still get a chance. After arguing with the funeral director, it was decided that I would not be able to go in the room. I was crushed, I was so hurt and upset but I was trying to hold it together for my mom. My mom was able to go in for a while and sit with her mom so I waited outside with other family members. After some time, my mom came outside in a hurry and told me to come quickly. I didn't know what had happened but apparently the funeral director had a change of heart and decided to go against the request of my Uncle and let me go view my Grandma. Walking in that room was so surreal. I couldn't believe my beloved grandma was laying there in her coffin. I never thought it would bother me as much as it did.

Recently we have been going to an indoor skatepark where she feels comfortable and has been practicing the two things she wants to accomplish.  She is very close with the ollies and is challenging herself with a rolling or flat practice, instead of on carpet.  We were rotating between the quarter pipes, dropping in and turning, and ollie practice on the flat land last weekend before the park got too crowded.  She was doing well and feeling encourage, telling me she felt good during our water breaks and how close she thought she was on reaching her goals.  On the big drop in, I used a big padded mattress to break her falls and give her some protection as she felt more comfortable with the height and sensation.  After about 10 runs where I moved the pad further and further back and she looked like she had the drop, we decided to run it pad free.  I offered to stand with a hand out in case she needed it and she looked good and confident at the top.  As she dropped, she slapped my hand and made it to the bottom of the ramp and onto the flat, but she was moving pretty fast.  On the flat she lost balance and went down on her back and whacked her helmeted head.  She was stunned and hurt and crying - partially from the pain and some for the shock and embarrassment.   I saw her fall and knew there was no serious injury, so I got her up and walked her to our bench to drink some water and catch her breath.  We took her helmet off and I got her to walk around the park, to walk it off mentally and physically for a few minutes.  When we got back to the bench, she put her helmet back on.

She was given three months to live and a very high certainty of mortality in that time frame, no matter the treatment. Mom's a fighter, so she decided to live those three months as honestly and fully as possible. She moved in with us so she could spend more time with my wife, my daughter and I. It was controversial but she decided against chemo or other treatment so she could enjoy her time. In the first month we traveled to Kauai and Peru, two places she had always wanted to go, but most importantly we walked to daycare to drop off my daughter after laughing through breakfast, watched crappy gameshows and silly movies, and played games. By month two she had lost her ability to really move around, and 60 days later, she passed in her sleep. The honest and tender moments we spent together in her last days have shown me the most important words in life are, \"I love you.\" I will never forget the time we spent together. My daughter will always have cherished memories of grandma, her last picture taken was at Pfeiffer park in Big Sur, snuggling with her. Sometimes life puts crises in your path to learn a hard lesson.

There was just a couple of problems, we were going to get a few groceries before we left and the night prior, we were in a rush to get to work and forgot the list. Not to mention, I had forgotten to give my pager back before I left work. Not just any pager, but the pager that is reserved for medical emergencies at the hospital. So we made a trip back in (about a 1 hour drive, round trip) to return the pager and to get our groceries. By this time we were very tired, we had both worked a twelve hour shift prior to this and we were hoping to leave by around 3pm or 4 pm. This did not happen. We did not get home until about 1pm, so we were going to sleep until about 5 o'clock. Well we didn't get on our way until about 9pm.

Climbing up the South Side of Mount HoodMeeting our guide and deciding whether or not to climb - Brett and I arrived early with plenty of time to meet Joe, our guide. Joe gave us an introduction of himself and his experience, checked our gear, asked us about our experience with climbing, had us sign the waivers that say if we die that they cannot be held liable. He then gave us the option, due to questionable weather to postpone the summit day for another time with better weather or to go ahead and try anyways the next day. After a short discussion, we decided to go ahead with it. After all we didn't want to have to make another long drive up to the mountain, and even if we didn't make the summit, we would still gain some experience, albeit expensive. Onward to the class we went. We learned how to kick steps, plunge step, self arrest techniques, traversing and the french step. We also learned several knots and proper roped travel.

I was only a white belt without any stripes, so I was only allowed to compete against other participants with my same ranking. I handled all of them with ease, and I knew it was because I had an incredible coach who was always teaching me important things I'd need to know. I knew my coach was telling me things the other coaches weren't telling their students, based on how easily I was beating them. The most surprising part of that day, to me, was how easy it felt to me to find ways to win. It meant a lot to me to feel confident enough in the finals of that competition, and it was all thanks to my coaches. When I won, it marked the genesis of when I truly became confident in myself, not only as a martial artist, but as a person. When I ended up winning the final match, I can remember telling my coaches that it was easy. My coaches told me it was only easy because I work harder than them, and that I'm more dedicated than them. I never thought that highly of myself.

My room was a mess, as usual, but I managed to find my graduation cap and gown and make my way to my house's dining hall for breakfast. We had really nice croissant egg and ham sandwiches, but also mimosas. These would later prove to be a mistake. After eating and having some existential dread with my roommates, we lined up outside to walk toward Harvard Yard for the Morning Exercises. We were led by a very small band, and I remember it feeling a bit strange how few of the hundred or so people there I really knew, despite having lived with them for the past three years. We made our way to the Memorial Chapel, where somehow (and certainly against fire codes), all roughly 1600 members of Harvard College's Class of 2019 were squeezed in. The minister provided a brief service, focusing largely on how important it was to remember to always think of others. This of course being a Harvard graduation, I knew that many of my classmates would go on to become business and political leaders, which are of course not a group generally thought of as being particularly ethical. After the service, we were herded back out into the Yard to begin the procession, led by my favorite organization, the Harvard University Band. It was at this point that my bladder was greatly beginning to regret the mimosas and coffee I'd had earlier in the morning. I took my seat next to my roommates, and we waited as all the pomp and circumstance commenced, beginning with the Sheriff of Middlesex County, adorned with a fine jacked and top hat, walked onto the stage and banged his silver-tipped staff three times, shouting that he did \"declare that the meeting will be in order!\". Eventually, the dean of each school would tell their students to rise and President Bacow would declare them to be graduated. Though throughout all this my mind was mostly fixed on how much I direly needed to pee, I was also thinking about how strange it felt to be leaving Harvard, a place that both felt like home and like a very strange place. After the Morning Exercises, I immediately ran over to the Band, where I danced around to our wonderful collection of fight songs, eventually conducting one myself, as is tradition for Band graduates. I don't know if I've ever felt as great a sense of belonging as I did in that moment, and looking back now, I can definitely say that I've greatly missed that feeling.", "label": "retold", "group": "N0PE5INN"}

I went to the grocery store after class one Monday afternoon, and I had my school bag with my laptop in it sitting in my back seat. As I drove to the store I noticed dark clouds forming on the horizon, and I knew it was going to rain. Of course, upon leaving the store it began to drizzle, and by the time I got home it was absolutely pouring rain. I did not want to risk getting my computer wet, and I knew it would be hard to protect it since I had to carry in the groceries as well. I decided to leave my computer bag in my car for a couple hours until it stopped raining, but I completely forgot about it, and I apparently also forgot to lock my car doors (I'm sure you can see where this is going!). The next morning I realized my mistake and went to my car to get my laptop, only to discover it had been stolen! Panicked, I immediately called my mom, and she advised me to first contact the police, and then contact my insurance company. The officer who arrived was very kind, but unfortunately it had rained again that morning, wiping away any fingerprints, and there was not much he could do to help other than file a report. Shortly after he left, I contacted my insurance company and was able to get money back for the items I had lost because it happened on my property and was covered by my renters insurance policy. I was still devastated, mostly because in taking my laptop, the thief also took my flash drive with all of my school files on it, meaning I now have to try to get back all the files I lost. On the bright side, my previous laptop was rather old and needed to be replaced anyway, so I now have a much nicer computer. Having my laptop stolen is definitely an event that I will not soon forget, and it taught me several lessons. First, I learned to always, ALWAYS, double check that my car doors are actually locked. Second, I learned that it is critical to keep a record of the product codes for all expensive items, because without that number the police cannot give you back your laptop even if they find it.", "label": "recalled", "group": "5DFFJPQ6"}

They were devout Southern Baptists, and I was raised to be the same.  As I got older my views about the origins of the world and humanity changed quite a bit.  I grew to believe in the things I was being taught in my science and history classes rather than the religious stories that my family repeated over and over.  None of this changed my love for my family and I never felt the need to let them know that my views about religion had changed.  Not only would they be hurt, they would be down right frightened for my everlasting soul.  It would be a real big deal, and since it doesn't harm me in any way to pretend that I still agree with their religious beliefs, I just let it go.  They're not going to change their minds, and I'm not going to change mine.  This is a situation where ignorance really is bliss for all parties involved.  I even still go to church with my family when I'm home.  I enjoy catching up with people I've known since childhood.  The social gathering remind me of growing up, and even if I don't believe I can still enjoy a great church potluck.

We spoke for hours that day and ended up having coffee and then dinner together before I left town.  We text each other daily and talk on the phone often, and I've made a couple of trips back home just to spend more time with her.  That chance meeting has evolved into a relationship, but, even though Sue and I have similar backgrounds, we don't share the same beliefs.

She could have showered at a later time but just did not care.  They were late for the bus and I had to drive them in because of her rudeness.  When I approached her about this, she just shrugged it off.  It is like she was a special guest we needed to cater to, rather than just being thankful she had a place to stay for a few days.

However, there are some limits to how far you can get with that cheap healthcare. The cancer treatments my uncle needed were just not available where we live. 12 Months ago, We had to go to the United States to seek better treatments for my uncle's cancer. We were very optimistic about my uncle getting the treatment that he needed in the United States. That optimism quickly faded however, once the costs were revealed to us. He does not have sufficient health insurance that would cover the cost in the United States, and there is no way the family can get that amount of money together for my uncle to pay for his treatments. 11 months ago, The option of a loan was there, but the amount of debt it would put the entire family in would weigh us down for the rest of our lifetime. 10 monts ago, my uncle made the decision to leave the United States untreated. He was very disappointed as we had all gotten our hopes up. Unfortunately it just was not meant to be. 8 months ago, my uncle made peace with his decision and very reflective about the life he had led. 6 months ago, the cancer spread to his brain and the rest of his body.

I have been volunteering for the past five years. In the past, the animals played on a playground at the animal shelter that was covered with gravel. Although the animals had a good time playing in the secure playground, they often experienced discomfort when playing at the playground. Gravel would become lodged in the pets paws and often would create problems such as tender, sore paws. Also, gravel would be tracked indoors and created the need to do extra cleaning and facility maintenance. Even though the gravel posed some problems, the animals loved the playground just the same. Even though the animals did not mind playing in the gravel, shelter volunteers often expressed concerns about the gravel. When I heard about the plans to install green turf at the playground, I was beyond excited as I looked forward to saying goodbye to gravel. The green turf would make the playground better as the turf was more like the surrounding that the animals who were sheltered would play in if they were living in a loving home. When the day came the install the turf, I was super excited as I watched the gravel being removed and replaced with soft turf. After the turf was installed, the time came to let the animals out to explore their new playground. The excitement that the animals showed when they rolled around on soft turf was heartwarming. It was apparent that they preferred the green turf instead of the rough gravel. The turf was a welcome addition that the animals were ecstatic to enjoy. I thoroughly enjoyed the turf installation event. I enjoyed it just as much as the animals.", "label": "imagined", "group": "I986W57O"}

I've noticed him bumping into things a lot lately but I thought he was just being clumsy. He has a bobtail so he's not as graceful as other cats I've seen... cats use their tails for balance. Anyway, I picked him up to comfort him and saw a bloody spot on his eye. It was kind of a dull brownish red, and I hadn't noticed it before. It wasn't a recent injury and it wasn't from hitting the table. I decided to see if it healed up or went away, and it didn't. Meanwhile, he kept on bumping into things. I decided it was probably time for a visit to the vet. I made the appointment, scooped him up into his carrier on the day of the appointment, and drove him out. He yowled the entire way because he hates going to the vet. We checked in and waited. After we got called back to the treatment area I explained my concerns. The tech weighed him, took his temperature, and looked into his eyes. A few minutes later the vet came in and we started talking. The vet peered into my kitty's eyes and quickly determined it was a tumor of some sort. \"These kinds of things happen sometimes as cats age, and usually there are a couple of choices. We can wait it out and see if it spreads, or we can go ahead and take the eye out. Keep in mind that if we let it spread there's a good chance your cat will go completely blind, but taking the eye out will cause a great seal of discomfort the rest of his life, and besides bumping into things, he doesn't seem to be hurting. So which would you like to do?\"I decided to wait, and it looks like that was a wise choice.

I had really been polishing my skills on my own recently and really wanted this job, it's at a great company with amazing pay and growth potential. There were a few interviews for the position. One was with HR just them getting to know me and vice versa. Another was a technical interview going over some specific things listed on my resume and how I would solve certain software problems associated. The technical interview was the most nerve wracking but I thought it went okay. This was a long shot position that I just applied for to see if I'd get a callback and maybe some interview practice with a big software company. However, the most shocking part was when I got a call informing me I was being offered the position I applied for and if I was still interested. The wave of emotion and adrenaline was almost overwhelming, it was difficult to stay professional over the phone with this feeling rushing through me.  (This company was not Microsoft by the way but is a large well known company). I think part of the reason I was hired was because it isn't about the money or the prestige of working at a great place like this, but that I'm really just excited to learn about their process of finding solutions and developing software in this kind of scope and scale. It so far has been an amazing ride. Lastly, it seems there is an error in the hit. It says you need 15-25 sentences, currently seeing 13 OR you need 600-3000 characters, I am currently at 1560.

This all started about 3 months ago when I was preparing for the release of my new EP.  I thought it would be a great idea to celebrate my birthday and the release show for my new album on the same day. It would be sort of a double celebration. My personal assistant felt it would be a good idea to go to Miami and spend my birthday there. The record company agreed and booked a very popular club on South Beach to have the party. I flew down to Miami a few days before the event, just to relax and take a break from all the stress of getting this record released. My personal assistant thought it would be good press for me to visit a local high school in the community and visit to talk with the students and I agreed.  Giving back has always been important to me and I personally feel that people of power and influence have an obligation to help others.  My assistant decided on Dade City High School as the school to visit.  She contacted the school and set everything up for me to come visit. When we arrived at the school, we checked in at the front office. I met the principal and he introduced me to the other people present in the office.  I signed autographs and took selfies with several of them.  Just as we were about to leave I heard this voice from behind me say, \"I always knew you were going to be a great musician.\" I turned around and saw a familiar face.... it was Cynthia Ortiz! As I walked up to her, I saw her name badge read \"Assistant Principal\".  One of the secretaries asked, \"you two know each other?\" Cynthia quickly chimed in, \"yes we do.....me and this gentleman were high school sweethearts.\" So that brings me up to tonight. After that high school visit, Cynthia and I started talking on a regular basis. I flew back to Miami last night to see her and have dinner.

Before the trip in 2017 we were still recovering from dealing withthe after effects from hurricane Irma. So I felt the time was right to go and see how my mom is doing as far as progressing for myself as I had heard other stories from my siblings. I figured the end of May was great as my children were done with school and my husband had time in his schedule to take vacation. We flew an airling that we have never flown because it was less costly and it was actually the only airline that had enough seats left for our family to sit together. We also flew out of an airport that we never ever fly out of. These two things alone were like an adventure for us because they were new experiences. I won't mention the shuttle driver that kept swerving in the other lane getting us to the airport as that was extremely scary and angering for me and I let the shuttle driver know that as well.  Back to the trip, we arrived in Las Vegas at my families home and it was around 3 in the morning (late flight). I was exhausted as we are on a time difference and gave my sister a hug and looked towards her piull out sofa to see my mom and her tiny frail body laying done.

It was really fun going all over town and showing her around. I also enjoyed her at my house while we played video games or us watching videos. It was a great experience and I thank her for randomly surprising me. She had originally wanted to stay for 5 days but she ended up staying for 8 days.

About two months ago, I had a hard day at work, my boss gave me a second warning about being late and warned me that next time I would be fired. On my way home from work that day, I stopped off at the liquor store and bought a jug of vodka. When I got to my car, I immediately started drinking, I felt so hopeless and like I had nothing to live for. I felt like my boss hated me and it seems like she lets other coworkers get away with a lot more stuff than me. All of my bills are late, my pay check barely covers my bills.  I started the car and started driving, I was going to go drive my car off the make out hill. I got to the top of the hill and my phone rang. My moms picture was staring at me. I knew I couldn\u2019t leave her, she would be devastated if I took my own life. I knew where I could get help, a friend of mine had went to a crisis stabilization unit a few weeks ago because she had started cutting her self again. I googled the address and followed the directions. When I arrived to the parking lot of the init it was a small white building with red and yellow tulips in front. I was ashamed and didn\u2019t want to go in. There was a knock on my car window. I looked up to see a guy in a blue polo shirt looking at me very concerned. I opened the door and he asked if I was alright. I told him I wasn\u2019t and I needed help. He said he would walk me in and help me check in. I was taken into a room and a lady checked that I didn\u2019t have any drugs or weapons. I was given hospital pajamas and told to put them on. All of my personal belongings were taken into the units custody. Soon a psychologist came into give me an evaluation. After I was at this place for seven hours with staff members monitoring me, I was told I could leave if there was someone who would come and get me. I called my mom and she came and picked me up, was so scared she was going to be mad at me, but when she arrived she gave me a huge hug as tears were streaming down her cheeks, she told me she was going to help me with my drinking problem and she loved me.", "label": "imagined", "group": "L9I3BK68"}

He was the only father figure that I ever had in my life. On the day he died President Trump was visiting the city that I live in. A few days before a white nationalist came into my city and murdered over twenty people. My husband was on the way to that Wal-Mart but turned around when he saw many police cars and a police helicopter in the area.

We had to navigate standstill traffic all morning and afternoon on the seventh while trying to get things settled at the funeral home and cemetery.  This was all due to that asshole Trump showing up here even though he was not wanted. In between talking to funeral directors and planning a memorial we watched Trump roll his fat body around our town on the T.V. At one point during the day we wanted to just go and eat some food together and talk as a family, but that took several hours because we had to wait for Chester Cheetos's motorcade to pass us on the freeway. In my life I had never felt such a strong dislike for another person as I did for that stupid man who came and made the day my grandfather died so much more terrible.  I could only imagine what the people who lost people in the shooting just days before were feeling. Many of them were planning to bury their loved ones on the same day we were.

I have known many parts of the world, many people, cultures and have heard their stories, legends and the wisdom they have. But two years ago I decided to take a trip but not one to another place but I gave myself the task of knowing the people around me thoroughly, to give them my confidence, to know that world they have inside their mind. Because as I say each person is a world, some are full of goodness, wisdom and much love but others are rotten by deception and evil. A few weeks ago on my trip to meet people I came across an old woman who gave me the first impression of being a kind, honest and honest person. I managed to talk to her, meet her and it was so good that I had fallen that I started a few days to give her an extremely good confidence. I could tell her everything and she, until one day I made a request, and this was to lend him $ 2,500 to pay his mortgage, when he told me this I was a little surprised by his request and after thinking a little I decided to give him the money. After a few days of lending him the money, that nice old lady who had met and liked me so much, began to change his way of being with me. It became more closed, when I visited her home she didn't attend me or sometimes she didn't even open the door to greet me, at that moment I started to see that something was very wrong. Although as a kind old lady I thought, \"Surely she must be busy or sick and doesn't want to help me.\"But one day I met her at the walmart and she saw me when she was surprised and greeted me with a lot of hypocrisy and left, it was no place to talk about the loan. So days and days went by until I took on the task of inquiring if she really had used that for her mortgage, the truth was that no, I spend it on something I still don't know. Seeing this, I went to her house and argued with her I was so upset that I could not even think, I felt so deceived, and I told her that I was going to report her to pay me the money. It was a very tense moment. Until she confezo me it was my grandmother, that grandmother who had believed missing since long ago, that grandmother since childhood so much wanted to have and now hate her for having deceived, that grandmother tricky and very unethical.

However, having too many responsibilities, giving account to your boss or a bad relationship with colleagues can lead to severe stress that must be nipped in the bud, either taking a while, or looking for another job destination. There is even the Burnout syndrome, which is characterized by a progressive physical and mental exhaustion, a lack of absolute motivation for the tasks performed, and especially by important changes in behavior in those who suffer it. There are great sources of stress from the family: we may live with a loved one who is not in the best physical or mental condition and we have to take care of him, traumatic events such as the loss of a family member, economic problems at home, with our couple or even if we have children, who behave in an undesired way. The best we can do in these cases is, if it is a serious problem, seek psychological or psychiatric help. Although not all sentimental ruptures are the same for everyone, the vast majority causes great stress and regret. Thinking if the other person has remade his life, stagnate, not be able to reorient our goals, stay locked up at home ... there are certain cases in which psychological help is also required to overcome this type of trauma. A change, a change of city, the own emotional break and therefore ending with all those daily and routine activities that made us feel protected can be important sources of stress. Getting married or having children also causes some anxiety about the future, since we can have negative thoughts about a new stage in our life. There is only one place where you can live and enjoy, and it is this present moment, the one you have here and now, if you let your mind go to the past or future, you will stress and it will be an unreal stress, because you create yourself with your thoughts. Whether in our circle of friends or in our own work, we can suffer from so-called \"toxic people\". The ideal for a bad environment does not cause us stress, would be to spend as little time as possible with this type of people. But as often it is not possible, because it can be a family, or at work where we have to spend so many hours, it would be good if the little free time we had would be fully enjoyed, in order to balance the balance of negativity that we have had to be exposed. To be well with others, first you have to be well with yourself to be alone. In the age of social networks, many young people feel alone or are too aware of mobile phone notifications, which can cause a high amount of stress.

I love to be able to provide for everyone in my family because it makes me feel important and like I matter to them. In my job as a PSE, I have to determine whether people qualify for government issued benefits. Not everyone qualifies, but everyone is always able to apply. It is a particularly difficult job that I wish paid more than it did. That doesn't mean I dislike it though. I wake up every day waiting for the new challenge that awaits me at work. It seems as though there is always a new scenario. The policy manual isn't always clear either. But I think that keeps the job fresh and interesting.", "label": "imagined", "group": "E9TY34YY"}

A few months ago,  an 11th  grade student's  mom advertised on line for a Math Tutor  because her son was failing terribly his Algebra 2 class.  The mom's name was Jenny and the student, Neal. There were only less that 3 months before school ended. I offered to help him and started assessing his weakness in Algebra 2.  Then I met with him every week to help him with his homework and test review packets. He started to improve over the weeks. Then, he started making better grades in his tests. One day, he aced a test and his mom was was happy that she sent me a note with an check including a bonus amount!

This was a very painful event that has affected my life even unto this point today. This all started a few months ago when I bought a dilapidated house in a poor part of town that was coming back to life. The idea of this house was to buy it and take a month or two to fix it up and then eventually sell it as that has been my success making a living. Unfortunately for me things didn't turn out that way and it took me over 5 months to sell this house. The reason that it took me a while to sell this house was because as I bought this dilapidated structure murders started happening within a mile or two of this house; and the police took 5 months to catch the man who was killing people. Once this man was caught the house sold in 2 weeks. Unfortunately for me that is about when my emergency money had become nonexistent. This caused me to stop buying houses, sell all my tools which let me pay for my mortgage for 1 more month and let me put my house up for sale. I am now stable and in an apartment and looking for something else to do now that my dreams have been crushed. With failure although not the outcome it gives life lessons I wouldn't have learned otherwise. Would I love to be killing the real estate housing market with my homes I refurbished, sure, but the lessons to take away is that you should have emergency funds for a year in case some unforeseen things happen. Another lesson is that one should always have a side hustle that they are able to get into if they are struggling with their main company. Another lesson is don't buy a home one can't afford if your money starts getting tight because that will kill any hope you had left. Although these events have left me worse off economically the experience these failures I have had are priceless I'm still young and eventually could start rehabbing houses in the future I will just need to save up and hopefully one day I can do what I love correctly.", "label": "recalled", "group": "RH42C973"}

French toast with whipped cream some strawberries and bananas with orange juice to drink with it. Since I finished my meal I went into the kitchen I noticed he had huge balloons spelling out my name. On the bottom of the strings that were attached to the balloons some cards were floating. I opened them up and they were all filled with love letters he had been writing for an entire year. Just when I thought my day couldn't get any better, he comes in and tells me to get ready because he had plans for the both of us and my family. We took off to the mall where he gave me some money and told me to use it on whatever it was that I desired. I bought myself some makeup and thigh high boots that day.

Since the permafrost, even in Southcentral Alaska is very hard, burials are traditionally not performed in the ground. Rather, remains are placed on top of the earth, and a small house is hand-built around them. Each spirit house is a work of art, and they were mostly made by friends and/or family of the deceased. I can spend hours there every time I visit to wander among the houses and to learn about the people that are resting there. I am surrounded by a sense of death and peace when visiting there, and going there is always an intense, emotional, visceral experience. I felt connected to the entire earth and to the native peoples that are eternally resting there. I stayed for hours thinking about my partner, my history, and my purpose in life.

Some of them have months of recovery already, some have a few days, but it's always unique. Each person comes in with their own personalities, pasts, goals, strengths & weaknesses. A couple months ago someone who has worked with our house before had recommended a new guy to me. He explained to me that he was struggling in another house with other guys harassing him and making it hard for him to sleep. I took this new guy in without fully vetting him personally, because I trusted the person who was vouching for him. This turned out to be a mistake on my part, and a lesson learned. As it turned out, the problems he was having in his last sober living was related to the manic episode he was going through that our mutual friend was unaware of when he brought him to my sober living. For the next 3 weeks the entire house was on edge. He was abrasive, intense, and was always trying to do things his own way instead of following the rules. Most of these rules were little things that we give warnings about, we give people a chance to correct them, and because he didn't break any major rules I couldn't just kick him out. I COULD have, but I wouldn't feel right doing it, for something so small. As time went on it became clear to me that this was not going to change. We went to great lengths to give him a real opportunity to make it work at our house. He got on the right medication and was taking it, we were giving him plenty of 'growing room'. When it became apparent to me that this was going to be an issue, I decided I would give him advanced notice that we would not be accepting his next months fees and he should start looking for a new place to live. After hearing this, he tried to turn a new leaf - apologize to people in the house, apologize to me, but by then the damage had already been done and the people were incredibly uncomfortable living with him. A week went by and I reminded him that his time at our house was coming to an end. I made it very clear, but it was obvious to me he was not fully comprehending it, he was in deniable about the situation. On the last day I figured he would try to leave the house early to go to work and get home late, putting us in the uncomfortable position of having an argument and having to kick him out on the street in the middle of the night. I decided I would have to talk with him before he left. I heard him stirring around 3 in the morning, I told him that today was the day, he attempted a rebuttal and I reiterated that today was the day. He finally accepted the fact, and took out all his frustration about the situation out on me. He became very bitter, insulting me, calling me a 'F-ing coward' and left the house in a storm of anger.", "label": "recalled", "group": "J8B0KFK0"}

I should have taken a short rest period that week but decided to go hard one more week. This, unfortunately, was a bad decision. After the intense gym session, my legs were tight. As I was leaving and getting into the car, I felt a relieving pop followed by extreme pain once I arrived at my destination. I kept thinking I was just tired, maybe worked it too hard, and then kept doing normal activity stuff that night. By the time I made it back to my house, I could barely walk or drive. When I stepped my foot outside the car to get out of the car, a sudden pop came from the inner part of my knee.  It was the worst feeling ever. I had to lay bed for at least 3 to 4 entire days and could barely even make it to the restroom. I had to have my lady come over and assist me to a bath. Then I was able to get her to get my crutches from the garage. I'm glad I kept those things! Finally I was mobile but far from walking. about 6-8 weeks go by while I'm beginning to master the crutches. I could even use on to push the gas pedal at times because driving was so difficult. Finally the crutches were not need anymore and started my long journey to recovery.  Everything was progressing and healing until I twisted my torso one day rolling over and pulled another muscle that overlaps the first one I tore at the gym. That set me back another 4-6 weeks. All in all, its been about 7 months and I'm still recovering but can function about 80% normal now. I'd say that's a hell of a significance from stuck in bed in excruciating pain.

It was at this time that we began to loosen up and went into what the fight was about. We talked about his sister, or my mother, for about a half and hour. After reaching common ground about her, we began to talk about our lives at length. I was particularly interested at how he had been for the last 15 years.

I had just been offered a job in a city on the other side of the country, and decided to move there, even though it meant being away from my friends and family. I know as the youngest of 4 children, this move was going to be hard on my Mom. She had always been so supportive of me throughout my life. She was always there for the good times, and the bad: when I fell off my bike and skinned my knee; when my first girl friend in junior high broke up with me; and when I didn't make it into my first choice for college. Mom was always there to comfort me and reassure me that everything was going to be alright. Mom had raised the four of us since my dad passed away when I was only six, and she devoted her life to us, really. Even though she had a college degree, and could have had a fulfilling career, she sacrificed that to make sure my siblings and I had good, safe home. The day I left for my new job and home, I said goodbye to Mom with tears in my eyes. I told her I would be home at Christmas, and not to worry about me. As always, she gave me a tight hug, and said that I would be successful at whatever I chose to do, and that she would always support me.

There were so many things left unsaid to her. I thought I would have time to tell her how much she shaped my life and my character. How much she had sacrificed for me. She was only 60 years old, plenty of time to spend with her, plenty of time to let her know how much I loved her.

Christmas day, 3 phone calls and I talked to the little guy because he has no one else to turn to, all very sad because I now see that caseworkers are the reason kids age out of foster care. They think they own the children and they actually hurt their chances for a perfect home. We have been searching for the right child for 4 years now, and caseworkers have proven  to be forgetful, careless and uncaring, they pretend to care, but they aren't there for those kids at all. Time will tell if we ever do bring a child into our home, time is not the child's friend, as most simply age out of the system and never find a loving family because the system is a money making machine for the states.", "label": "retold", "group": "5J5LJ3DH"}

Never in my entire life have I been this introspective, so it's a very interesting phenomenon. Two months ago my dog passed away suddenly in the night. It was terrible. He was my first ever pet, and there was no indication that anything was wrong with him. I cried for so many days after it happened. I had lost one of my best friends. It ultimately made me realize how old my dog had gotten, and how time really does fly. He was the only loved one I have ever lost in my life, so this was a very tough experience on me. Thinking about time also made me more motivated to work harder to spend time with other people in my life. It's funny how that works. I know I have been slacking on seeing certain family members over the last few years, and this experience with my dog makes me want to change that. It stinks that I had to lose someone close to me to realize this, but I guess that's the price you pay for learning things in life. One day soon I will get a new dog and spend all the time with him that I can. I now have a deeper meaning of what is important in life and how I'd like to spend my time.", "label": "imagined", "group": "09LYTC5U"}

I stood looking at her and crying for a few minutes and then finally told the vet staff I felt like she had already passed. The vet staff immediately took me to the back where the Dr. came and confirmed her death. . They gave her back to me (at my request) and I brought her back home.

Or so we're told, we'd only been their during our American summer but it was cool and we had jackets on. We had left our hotel to go get dinner in the evening and wanted to see if we could find a place doing Aussie BBQ. Shrimp on the barbie and all of that! We found a really nice restaurant in the center of the city. We ordered some drinks and then got a few plates of steaks and some lamb. The meat was really good. After we finished up we paid the bill and headed out to find our hotel. It was dark and everything looked completely different. We needed WiFi to contact anyone because we didn't have service for our mobile plan here in Australia. So I followed my mom and after maybe an hour we realized we were lost. Mom decided it would be a great idea to backtrack from the restaurant but we couldn't find it. Eventually we got back to the restaurant, it was around 11PM and they were closed. So she tried to remember all the specific little things we had seen on the way when a stranger came over who seemed to recognize her. He knew my mom's name, Sue, and so we thought it must be someone we knew. So we followed him and even though we were clueless about where we were we eventually thought we were on track. Strange as it may sound we really did think we were going the right way. Suddenly, we arrive at some kind of party, it's 12:30 and this guy introduces us to his friends who he expects we know, but we don't and they don't know us. Suddenly we realize we've followed some stranger who we don't know at all who thinks he knows us! It was hilarious. We laughed for about 10 minutes because we explained we were staying in a nearby hotel.

A group of old high school friends and current best friends decided to get together for a psychedelic adventure at a buddy's house. One friend watched over us all sober as a safety precaution. The other three took high doses of psychedelics. I myself only took a very small threshold dose, as I was not in a mental state for a full one. It was awesome hanging out with my bros like were were young again. I hadn't seen Andy in over a decade, and he has been so depressed, on that day he was as giddy as could be. My friend George had a very rough time and did not have fun, while Chad took care of him. Bob took the most of all, and was having a blast in his own world. I decided to retreat to the shed, for some quiet and meditate, as everyone else was busy. It was fantastic, I was able to work out many of my anxiety and panic issues on that day, or at least identify why they are happening better. It was incredibly therapeutic. More so than any traditional therapy by far. The drug allowed me to look at my thoughts from a new perspective, and I was able to see things so clearly I could not at all before within my mind and how it functions. I am a much better person for it, and feel more mentally sound than I have in years. The day ended slowly without much commotion, but we all had a blast. The funniest part was when Andy saw a ton of ants in the yard and said \"They out here.\" The timing was just so hilarious, but you had to be there to understand. I am so happy that I decided to take part, it will be one of my life long memories, as where I started to finally heal from my mental issues, and reconnected with long lost best friends from high school.

I was standing beside her when the mist started hitting us and she was shivering. I offered her my poncho and we started talking.  It turned out that we were both students at NYU.  She was a freshman with her eyes on law school and I was getting ready to graduate with a business degree and begin working towards my MBA. Back at school, our lives were busy, but we made time to see each other, even if it meant just sitting together to study in the library.  As we got to know each other, I realized that Emily was someone I wanted to be with forever.  After completing my master's, I was able to start saving for a ring.  Six weeks ago, exactly 3 years after we met, I suggested that we make a trip back to Niagara Falls. I placed the ring in the pocket of her yellow poncho.  When she put the poncho on, she pulled out the box and I got to one knee.  I was worried for a moment as she gazed at me without saying anything, a thoughtful look in her eyes.  She seemed to snap out of her trance and said yes.  Everyone on the boat clapped and we got many congratulations as we exited after the tour. I was still concerned about her hesitancy, though. I thought we were perfectly happy and I was confident she wanted to marry me. I asked her a few days later if everything was ok. I noticed that she would occasionally glance at the ring on her finger with a sort of sad look in her eyes.  She said that she was concerned about law school. She had applied to a few schools, some which were several hours drive away. She wanted to marry me, but was afraid that being so far apart for that long would be difficult and that our relationship might suffer.  She was torn between possibly pursuing a different career so that we could go ahead and marry or having to wait through three difficult years apart.

I cut out things in my life that were holding me back, making me negative, or were not conducive to being my best self. I gave myself one month to go without social media, lustful thoughts, cussing, television, and sweets. It's definitely been a challenge! Since most people are on a health kick after the New Year, giving up sweets has been relatively easy, though I do sometimes miss having something sweet after dinner. Losing a few pounds has encouraged me to stick with the sweet dessert abstinence. The hardest thing has been giving up television. I have felt very out of touch with what's going on in the world. I also miss some of my favorite shows and find myself wondering if I will have trouble following the story arc once I start watching again. Social media has been surprisingly easy to give up. I guess that's because the negativity on there was really getting to me. I don't miss the drama or the rudeness. I have also found that by focusing my thoughts more positively and not swearing, cussing, or thinking lustful thoughts, I have more energy for creative thoughts.

I think they started fighting over a bone or something, but my big dog attacked our smaller dog in the yard and cut him up pretty good. A couple of my friends had to rush in to break them apart. The poor little guy needed 13 stitches and has a limp now. Our big dog, Brutus, has shown some aggressive tendencies before, but this was something else. My husband is pretty frustrated and unsure about what to do. I called a local training place that specializes in aggressive dogs like Brutus, and they suggested giving him anti-depressants for the time being. He is scheduled to stay there for an extended time starting on Monday. I'm worried because when I met with the head specialist they indicated that Brutus might have to be put down if he cannot control his aggression. This would absolutely break my heart if it ends up happening. I know my husband would really struggle too since Brutus was his dog from before we met and moved in together. He's taking it pretty hard already. We just have to cross our fingers and hope Brutus can learn how to be a bit more chill in the future. I don't think we could stomach having our dogs fighting that badly again. Hopefully it can all work out for the best.", "label": "imagined", "group": "09LYTC5U"}

In the spring, we knew that we had to pack and move everything in every room. We already knew everything was being kept that was in a room at that point. All we had to do was decide what was going into storage and what was being moved to the new house. I took a room a day to pack so that it was not incredibly overwhelming, and I could leave important rooms, like our bedroom and the kitchen, for the last week. We spent the last three weeks before closing just moving boxes to storage and to the new house. We unpacked at each move. By the time we got to closing, the house was empty and the new house was full and fully livable. The final closing date came as more of a relief than a sad and emotional date, as I had feared.

They are trained professional who will try their best.  So the operation began to drain the blood.  Good thing, they drained it.  Bad thing, it couldn't be completely drained as it kept filling back.  With that complication, she lost her memory and was in a dementia-type state.  When she woke up after the operation, she did not recognize anyone and everyone in the room was crying.  That day, I had a meeting so I was the last one to reach there. When I entered the room, she called me by name and everyone was surprised.  That is the best moment in my life that out of that gloomy limbo and darkness, she still knew who I was.

Adrenaline and cortisol are designed to support us through bursts of intense activity, but in the long term cortisol can knock out the feel-good hormones serotonin and dopamine in the brain, which help us feel calm and happy, affecting our sleep and heart rate and making us feel jittery. It would seem then that this physiological adaptation, fostered by our behavior, is a predominant reason for the poor concentration so many people report. The fact that we are the cause of this is, paradoxically, good news since it hands back to us the potential to change our behavior and reclaim the brain function and cognitive health that\u2019s been disrupted by our digitally enhanced lives. And this may even be more important than just improving our levels of concentration. Constant, high levels of circulating stress hormones have an inflammatory and detrimental affect on brain cells, suggests the psychiatrist Edward Bull more, who has written about the link between inflammation and depression in his latest book, The Inflamed Mind. Depression, along with anxiety, is a known factor in knocking out concentration. Put simply, better concentration makes life easier and less stressful and we will be more productive. To make this change means reflecting on what we are doing to sabotage personal concentration, and then implementing steps towards behavioural change that will improve our chances of concentrating better. This means deliberately reducing distractions and being more self-disciplined about our use of social media, which are increasingly urgent for the sake of our cognitive and mental health. It takes about three weeks for a repeating behavior to form a habit, says Jeremy Dean, a psychologist and the author of Making Habits, Breaking Habits. Getting into a new habit will not happen overnight and adaptation can be incremental. Start by switching off smartphone alerts, or taking social media apps off your phone, then switching off the device for increasingly long periods. Practise concentration by finding things to do that specifically engage you for a period of time to the exclusion of everything else. What is noticeable is that you cannot just go from a state of distraction to one of concentration, in the same way that most of us cannot fall asleep the minute our head hits the pillow. It takes a bit of time and, with practice, becomes easier to accomplish.", "label": "recalled", "group": "K7F6X6F6"}

I'm still recovering from my big Las Vegas birthday weekend, so maybe that saying isn't true.  Anyway, we had so much fun.  We got it in and partied hard.  I realized that I was getting older and wanted to make up for lost time.  I wasn't much of a partier when I was younger, too shy and introverted.  Severe social anxiety kept me cut off from life.  Plus, I come from a highly dysfunctional family and was burdened with huge responsibilities from a early age.    Once I got into my thirties I decided that enough was enough.  You only get one life to live so you might as well live it.  Back to the celebration!  I've never been to Las Vegas before, never even been on a plane, it was huge and overwhelming but in a good way.   Very hot too.  I just wanted to stay in my air conditioned room or lounge by the infinity pool but my friends dragged me up and down the Strip.  We went from casino to casino, buffet to buffet, indulging almost all of the seven deadly sins.  Marie tried to take us to a strip club, but they were too full.  Oh well.  I won about $500 but spent it getting us bottle service at the dance club.  I almost felt kind of foolish being my age, like the old auntie in the club trying to keep up with the young ones.  I had much more fun eating my way through the elaborate buffets and shopping at the fancy stores.  I bought some cute clothes but I can't fit them.   I think I gained 10 lbs that weekend and I'm still trying to work it off.  My friends liked the casinos the best, especially since I gave them the money to gamble!  Overall, I had a good time and I can say that I did something fun in life.  Hopefully, I can have more fun in the future and not just on my birthday.", "label": "imagined", "group": "S2MEKBID"}

There have been times where I\u2019ve done okay, times where I\u2019ve had an audience of three, and times where I\u2019ve had a full house with uproars of laughter at every punchline. About five months ago, I competed in a stand up comedy night in which comedians were awarded based on audience votes. After a night of 14 talented comedians performing, I won audience favorite comedian and as a result, a handsome cash reward. I felt so much adrenaline and esteem from this experience. Some of my closest friends made the trip to see my performance about an hour and a half from our home. I had my favorite people with me and I was so joyful and excited. I had never felt quite this way before. Audience members were constantly approaching me and praising me for my performance. Some told me I inspired them and some told me they really identified with my style of comedy. They appreciated the work they knew and understood must have gone in to writing and practicing my set. I felt so rewarded by my emotions and the cash prize was simply a bonus. I still keep a twenty from that cash prize as a reminder that what I do is worthwhile. It can be hard pouring your soul out in my style of comedy. It\u2019s emotional and requires an unprecedented level of vulnerability and genuine personality. I\u2019ll never forget the emotions or some of the things people said to me that night. I was so nervous as the night started by confidence began to grow and wane as the night went on.

We weren't able to really do this before besides random holiday meet ups sporadically so it really was a nice change of pace. We got to really spend some time together that wasn't rushed and catch up on at least a decade worth of misc stuff. It was surprising how much fun it was because I always had memories of being bored out of my mind. I guess when you're a kid/teen you would rather be doing other stuff but now that I'm an adult I understood the value of it. I wish I could go back in time and tell myself not to squander these moments as we never know if they will be the last. Some of my family had passed away in the time frame from when we last met up for the holidays and the reunion so I won't ever get to spend time with them again and that sucks. It was really good to see my aunt and uncle again as they are the most similar to myself with our love for technology and in general relaxed personalities. I wish I had connected with them much sooner but when my parents divorced people kind of took sides and it was hard to reach over the divide. I won't make that mistake again I want to keep these relationships going so we did promise to keep in weekly or bi weekly contact. We are all in general bad at communication so hopefully we can keep this up and I will try to take control of it being the youngest. I guess personally I am at fault for the divide when it comes to this family. I should've been the one to really reconnect us years ago but I was just generally absorbed in the grind of life and my immediate friends/family that I didn't try.

It is August, and she has terrible allergies this time of year, making her very itchy. She woke up in the middle of the night very itchy, and was furiously scratching. It was making her collar jingle, and also she was bumping up against me as she scratched. I was having a hard time going back to sleep, because she was so itchy and scratching so much. I am a massage therapist, and am very interested in how the nervous system, emotions, and physical feelings are connected. I was thinking about this, and Sassy's problem- and I decided, as an LMT, to try to activate her parasympathetic nervous system, to see if it would calm her and her itchiness. I slowly and gently began to massage her, and she instantly relaxed and stopped scratching. I continued massaging gently, and rubbing her tummy, and she continued relaxing. I did this for about 20 minutes, and she had fallen comfortably asleep. It made me feel really, really good that I could help her, and comfort her enough to help her sleep....and also so that I could sleep! I felt good about my scientific theory, as well as my instincts as a dog mama. We have had several sleepless nights lately, due to her allergies and uncomfortableness.

I fear that if I don't write it down soon I may not believe it myself in another 1/4 of a year. As you might know, there are no leash laws in my community. The neighborhood dogs tend to spend the days visiting each other and ... being dogs. Most of them go back to the particular human family that \"owns them\" at night to be fed and cared for, but there are always a few that don't seem to belong to anyone in particular and just sort of make the rounds between a few different homes. Well, my wife stumbled on a post on facebook that a local stray who we had always called Rufus had been taken into the pound by animal control. He had been found under a nearby house when the homeowners investigated the source of a whimpering noise they had been hearing for a few days. Apparently there was a thorn in his foot that had become badly infected, and these people (not having money for veterinary care, nor desiring to have a dog) had him taken to the shelter. Well, I had always been rather fond of Rufus in passing. So when my wife suggested we cover the cost of his antibiotics and adopt him I agreed. A couple weeks of healing and good food and he was back to his rascally good nature. However, now that we \"owned\" him on paper problems began to arise. You see, my wife and I live on the edge of town and coyotes live in the valley below us. They don't really cause any trouble in town, but they are the reason that most farmers in the area have a dog to scare them away from livestock. It used to be that when the coyotes would start \"singing\" at night several of the town dogs would \"rap battle\" right back. A territory thing I suppose ... Well, Rufus in particular had always seemed to see it as part of his oikos to protect the smaller dogs and bark loudly to keep the coyotes at bay. Nobody ever seemed to mind, but once he became \"our\" dog that changed. Neighbors began to call the police with noise complaints. They demanded that we keep him in the house at night. Now, he was a very sweet dog, obedient to many commands like sit, shake, Eskimo Kiss, etc. but being rather a free spirit the one thing he would not do is come when he was called. He would come close enough to \"check in\" but not quite into arms reach until he was good and ready. Well, after a few more exchanges with the cops we started keeping him tied up with a cable when he went out so we could make sure that he came inside at night. Well, one night the local pack of coyotes were raising a right ruckus. Long story short, Rufus broke the cable and ran off to join them, I have been hearing his deep happy bark mingling with their song from the valley.", "label": "imagined", "group": "HR9VAELS"}

He would jump on the side of the bed to wake me up and then pull me outside once I got the leash on him. He always wanted to go for walks and play. I loved that dog. He was my first dog.

He is also an intern for his father's company, which is in the real estate business. He did the various odd jobs there where he cleaned up, made sure the pantry and other areas were well stocked and helped to input data into the company's systems. Part of the money that he saved was used to start up an IRA account. I work as a financial analyst and tried to show him what would happen if he used the power of compounding interest and how large he could grow his nest egg if he had 40+ years to invest. He ended up opening the account and buying 25 shares of Disney.

My dad took me out diving and it was so incredible.   We had so many great Saturday afternoons spent on the water.  As I grew older and started to go to different places I met other dive masters.  I did't realize that people could get paid to go diving.  It was pretty cool to think that maybe I could do that for a job.  I put off getting my certifications because it's expensive.  It's also kind of scary to think that I will be responsible for other's peoples lives.  But the truth is that anytime you are diving you are responsible to help out the people that are around you.  I really think that now is the right time in my life to pursue this.  I've looked around at some different schools and I've picked the one that is going to be right for me.  It looks like the program is going to take awhile to finish, but that's ok.  I can probably pick up a parttime job in the dive shop while I'm working through all the certifications.", "label": "imagined", "group": "PEBTZFD3"}

I had known his mother for many years. We worked as lab techs together is a hospital. She had just immigrated to the United States from Lebanon and was new to everything. I spent a lot of time helping her with things like signing up for insurance, taxes, and getting a driver's license. She was very grateful and we remained close friends through the years. She had three sons and I helped her celebrate all of the births. Her youngest son was born on my birthday, and we often had a joint birthday celebration. I left the hospital to take a job at a University but we still remained in contact and got together at least once or twice a year. When her youngest son chose to attend the college that I work at, I was very excited. I saw him nearly every day on campus and he was like my second son. In the past year his family had difficulties. The boy's father had early onset Alzheimer's disease and was in the terminal stages of the disease. The father was kept at home and was lovingly cared for by his sons and their mother.  In addition for caring for his father, the boy was always working to earn money for his college bills. In his Junior year confided in us his desire to go to Medical School. He did get accepted into Med School. When it came time for graduation, he told his mom that he wanted to invite me and my husband to attend his graduation. It was very touching to see him walk across the stage and accept his diploma. I felt sad because I knew his father and was sad that he could not be there to see his son accept his degree that day. He would have been so happy and proud. After the event his two brothers were the first to see him. They both took off running and simultaneously tackled him into a great bear hug of brotherly love. Their hug lifted him off of his feet. It was the most memorable part of that special day for me.", "label": "recalled", "group": "USM8LPS8"}

At that time, there was also something leaking like a gas tank leaking in the back of the car. The guy got that tank out and shut the valve. My friend and the guy were trying to pull the driver out. Then this Spanish lady drove by, stopped, came out of the car and was crying, she came to me asked what is going on and is the driver ok, she was crying so hard and she was telling me that she told the driver to drive slow, but he didn't listen. So I knew by then that she was his friend, I held her and told her that everything will be ok, they are trying to get him out, the cops are on the way too. I was shaking but I know that if I don't remain calm it will scare her even more.  Later the cops were asking us about the details of the accident, so she was there looking at the car and waiting for them to get the driver out.

My step father, a very healthy man most of his life, was suddenly struck ill with a possible stroke. As a family, we've always been close. We generally know when one or another is sick or feeling bad. He had exhibited signs and symptoms, but we could not get him to respond or go to the Doctor. It really upset us that we could not get him to go. His stubbornness initially made us mad, but we got past that. He was just too ill to feel mad at during this dire situation. Upon visiting the doctor at the ER, he was diagnosed with a Subdural Hematoma. A Subdural Hematoma is what doctors refer to as a traumatic brain injury - which is in effect a collection of blood between the covering of the brain. It is very serious and can lead to death or disabilities if left untreated.  The Doctor will usually put you on a blood thinning medication such as Warfarin if your body is able to respond. Fortunately for our family, he got there in the nick of time. He is resting, recuperating, and responding to treatment and prognosis is looking great for a full recovery. We now wonder if his initial stubbornness was the result of the stroke - that is, the symptoms of not fully understanding the seriousness of the matter and deciding against going to the hospital.", "label": "imagined", "group": "CCOKLDJD"}

Our boss had decided to automate most of the company going forward in a spur of the moment decision. Something about cutting costs and making a shift towards automated intelligence, he said. The only thing that mattered was the fact that we were given two months before we would effectively be phased out of our jobs. Entire departments were being replaced with robots to perform the same tasks. Pretty soon the water cooler talk was crazy, and the entire mood of the office became more somber than a funeral. Over those last few weeks it was tough having to say goodbye to so many colleagues I had built a rapport with over the years. Real people. The type who can form friendships that can't exactly be duplicated by a robot. My job search, which basically began when I opened the email, has yet to offer up much hope. In turn this has really affected my mental state, and it's tough remaining optimistic about new openings when I've been turned down so many times.

We celebrated at a very nice restaurant located in the Arts District of Downtown LA that my Dad had never been to. Upon finishing our meal he remarked that he had grown up within walking distance of the restaurant. Considering we had time to kill before the movie we had planned to see later, Dad decided to show us the house where he spent several of his formative years. My dad is a natural storyteller and he's immensely proud of his hometown so it was an extra gift in itself to see and hear him gesticulate and intone about stories from his childhood and which friends used to live where and what kind of misadventures he got himself into as a young boy. Our kids were very taken by some of the mischief my dad would get into, like shining the shoes of local gangsters, or ducking away from the school bullies by running across he rooftops and sometimes jumping from roof to roof over great heights to escape a beating. They laughed at his comedic embellishments, and they were more than a little incredulous at his fierce independence and feisty spirit, considering Dad was telling them how he was basically given free reign as a five year old to explore his surroundings by himself. He told us several intimate personal details like how strained his relationship was with his stern and often emotionally cold father and how he would find solace and understanding in the warmth of his mom. He also mentioned details about the day she died when Dad was only sixteen, which he very rarely does. This cross generational sharing is very important to my wife and I. It gives our kids perspectives into their own lives and a sense of history as to where they come. It also gives them insight into their own emotional makeup and personal perspectives. Our kids have a strong moral center, and a \"can do\" attitude when it comes to fixing their own problems. I think it's very valuable for them to know that the are values that we have tried very hard to instill in them in order to make them strong and productive members of society working for the public good. When you're young you think that birthdays are all about the cake, the presents, and the celebration of yourself, and in many ways those aspects are very important to my family. But as I get older I find that the only thing I really want is to be secure in the knowledge that my family knows how tight and lasting our connections are to each other and how our common bonds come from a place of great emotional depth.

They dated for a year and got married at a courthouse in Oregon. They decided to come home to Alabama to have a \"real wedding\". The outside ceremony was amazing, but HOT (August in Alabama is MISERABLE)! After the ceremony, my son gave me a present. It was a tee shirt that said \"Mom\". The word \"mom\" was crossed out and underneath that said, \"Grandma\". It took me a few seconds to process what my son was trying to tell me--when I figured it out, I started crying. I am so happy for my son but still in shock that I am going to be a grandma. I have always lied about my age and even jokingly introduced myself at my son's wedding as his aunt.

It was a letter informing me that the school was re-opening its doors.  This meant I my days of homeschooling were coming to an end!  A year earlier, I had learned that the school my children were going to was closing.  Major repairs needed to be done on the school and I had to find an alternative for my children.  I looked and looked for good alternatives, but there were none.  I live in a small town and the closest school was miles away.  It just wasn't feasable to drive my kids to school when it would take us an hour to get there and an hour to get back.  Hence, my journing into the world of homeschooling began.  I didn't want to homeschool because I knew it would be difficult.  My children were used to the routine of public school and not their mom being their teacher.  How was I supposed to keep them engaged and interested in learning when they are at home?  The distractions in the house were too great with all their electronic devices.  I decided that I had to become two different people, mom and teacher.  I also had to designate an area of the house as the school zone.  Despite this, my children had a hard time adjusting to me being their teacher.  They would wine about the homework and compare me to what it was like when they were attending public school.  I had to remind them over and over why we were doing things they way we were.  I think it took us a good couple of months to really get into the flow of homeschooling.  It wore me out to homeschool.  I did enjoy having my children home, but it was exhasting mentally and physically.  I was used to some quiet time during the day, but now my day was full of teaching my own children.

The apartment was apart of a transitional housing program/intentional living community. These are programs that not only provide housing, but they also provide support in other areas (education, family mediation, career opportunity and more). It wasn't an ideal environment that I wanted to be in, and I ended up isolating myself from most of my peers. The people I did get involved with were probably the worst social group that I could have chose. I began smoking weed and tobacco products daily. I began drinking and I tried other drugs also. I knew the risks, but at this point with no family and being forced to drop out of college, I felt like I had nothing to look forward to.

My wife and I were riding my Harley Davidson motorcycle in a nearby town, on a cool Sunday Afternoon. We were in a town not far from where we live, but I am not completely familiar with the streets there. As we came around a bend, a red light prompted us to stop. The street was not asphalt, but more of a concrete, very susceptible to potholes. As we leaned into the corner, my front tire slid into a deep long groove. This caused the weight of my bike to shift, throwing us off balance and nearly wiping us out. The road was quite busy behind us. I feared dropping my motorcycle, but at such a low speed, I was much more concerned with the traffic behind us. It was truly a frightening experience. We were both terrified, left shaken by the near-miss. Luckily, I was able to place my foot down on the pavement, which saved us from going over entirely. It all happened so quickly, and I am not the most experienced rider. I can still feel the uneasiness in my chest anytime I take off to ride. This is especially true whenever my wife joins me. I've become much more aware of my surroundings as a result. I also spend much more time scanning the area in front of me while I ride.", "label": "recalled", "group": "FY0MINNR"}
{"id": "36H9ULYP63GDHIBHS3SGM31QM0DJF6", "text": "The event that most comes to mind to me that happened in recent months is a trip I took to Baltimore with some friends. It's a convention we go to every year but this year a new friend decided to come with us and we were able to introduce him to the experience we have every year. It's a convention with music and lots of arcade games, we always end up staying up all night playing games and sleeping during the day when the arcade space is super busy. It's an all night convention so you get the most out of the arcade if you stay up all night and play games while most of the other people are back at their own hotels or are asleep. During the day and especially on the weekends it gets way too crowded in the arcade space to really enjoy it without waiting in super long lines. So it makes more sense to just become a night owl for the duration of the trip and enjoy yourself at night. We managed to get a room with a balcony in the hotel of the convention itself which is the goal every year we go. It costs a bit more but being able to sit on the balcony and wind down while still watching the convention is always worth the extra cost. Our friend seemed to enjoy himself and managed to get some autographs from a composer he really likes so hopefully he joins the yearly crew that goes. Every year I tend to focus on some different things and get some new things out of it. This time I was even more arcade focused than usual because I was really into a specific cabinet I can only find at this place every year. The other part of the trip I always look forward to is the food. There is a really good Chinese food place just a quick walk from the hotel we go to every year. There is also a steak place we go to at least once if not twice every year we go. Aside from those two though we tend to just stock up on snacks and maybe order some Grubhub or UberEats to pick up at the hotel. As lots of the convention area is overbooked with people trying to get food. We had some trouble with our room keys not working properly but other than that the trip was flawless and was a much needed vacation. I am looking forward to going again next year and I hope the same group continues to go as it's one of the things I look forward to most every year.

And, in April, my doctors informed me that they had done all the could and that I should enter hospice.  A week after this revelation, I accompanied my daughter, son-in-law to be, his mom, my elder daughter and her husband, to the park where they were to be married.  It was a beautiful, unseasonably mild and sunny, Spring day.  There was a small lake, with a beach where the ceremony was to take place.  My daughter wore her bridal veil as I walked her down the \"aisle\" of sand to the lake's edge.  A family Pastor shared some of his thoughts and prayers as I \"presented\" her to her beloved, tears in all of our eyes and immense joy in our hearts, for this moment.  Afterward, we went to their favorite restaurant, The Green Turtle, for a mock wedding luncheon.  Then, a few days later, as I prepared to leave for hospice, one of my doctors called.  They wanted to delay hospice and invited me to participate in an experimental regimen of new treatments.  By this time I had resolved that my life was ending and my soul was at peace.  My family said they would abide by whatever decision I chose.  In the end, I accepted the treatments.  They were profoundly invasive, painful...and miraculous.

For some reason the teacher labeled him as a difficult, talkative kid. James is so quiet and sweet this made no sense to me. So there was no way she was going to nominate him. However, his teacher this year recognized how sweet and kind he is. He tends to get walked all over so it is nice to see him be recognized for who he is. I am very proud that I have raised such a kind and helpful child. He was recognized for being a leader in the class. For helping his teacher and recognizing others good behavior and potential. He is always trying to help his fellow classmates. We went to the awards ceremony and my eyes filled with tears to see my shy, quiet baby getting recognized for all the good he has done. As a mother there is nothing better than seeing your child succeed. It may seem like a silly elementary school award, but I look at it and see how far he has come. I also see that in the future he will be the kind of adult I want him to be.", "label": "recalled", "group": "M5QUP5N6"}

They probably would never speak to me again. That's what they did to my grandfather, anyway.  Before he died, it was found out that he had a relationship with a fellow sailor while serving in the Navy. My family kept it very secret, and I only heard them talk about it in private once or twice. They were disgusted by him and were worried his actions would affect their standing in the church. They were so upset that they didn't talk to him for the last few months of his life. Last weekend my grandfather passed away. My mother didn't even show up to his funeral. I wonder how they could be so heartless, especially to their own family members. It makes me really sad that they've closed themselves off from the world so much.

My husband, his dad, was his coach.  They were together for so many years as my husband coached him and he played shortstop mostly and was trained to be a pitcher.  I sat at all of his games, watching them both interact together and it was a special thing to see.  I didn't know anything about baseball when I was growing up.  I had two sisters and we really didn't play sports.  As they progressed in skill over the years, my knowledge of the game increased to the point where I might have been able to coach a time myself. So many thing happened over those years but the constant was always baseball. My son graduated and went to college on a baseball scholarship.  After he graduated, he wound up playing minor league ball for a time and we traveled to see him play. Once he started his business career, he turned his attention to his other interests and there were no more games to attend.  Many years went by until he was asked to fill in for an adult team member on this amateur team.

There were certainly times I felt like giving up and that I was never going to get the raise, and I had even started looking for a new job. What I was making just was not enough money for me to live my life the way I wanted to live it. Well, a few months ago, my supervisor and only other person on my team broke his pelvis. Since the injury was so severe, he has been out of the office for going on three months now, leaving me alone to do ALL of the work we were once both responsible for. The circumstances were horrible for him, but it was my time to shine and prove myself to my boss. I took on extra tasks, regularly stay late, and am a bigger part of meetings my supervisor used to run. Because of how willing to do extra work I was, people started to take notice and none of our regular processes had any interruptions. My boss and other colleagues began to take notice of how I was working. I was receiving a lot of praise, and it felt good, but it was just that. It was all just praise, nothing material came of it. Well, last week I was called into a meeting with my manager and my director to discuss all of the work I had been doing. In this meeting, they discussed with me a promotion they were going to give me and allowed me to negotiate a higher pay as a thanks for all of my hard work. They had realized how instrumental I was to the team and wanted to keep me happy working here. I was ecstatic.

They made the decision for me that the event was something I wouldn't want to do. I often become a little down during the winter months and this is the exact reason why. I sit in my house for weeks at a time without any contact with people (besides my daughter and home care workers) other than Facebook. It makes me feel really frustrated and lonely. People often say \"well, you should plan something\" or \"invite people over.\" I do those things but I don't feel like I should always have to initiate social events especially when there are events going on that are already planned. During the winter months, my days are nearly exactly the same each day. I get up, work, take care of my daughter, and go to bed. I really have very little to look forward to except spring. Yes, spring, that season that is still months away.", "label": "retold", "group": "7B8K56HT"}

I have been used to riding hard tail mountain bikes.  I had heard of and seen full suspension mountain bikes, but the prices were out of my reach. Also, I wasn't expecting much of an improvement. I saw full suspension bikes as a kind of gimmick. I figured the bike would not ride as well. I figured the suspension would not have much of an effect. Well, I was wrong. I fell in love with the bike within 5 minutes of riding it. It wasn't long before I discovered that I could ride it for longer. It was less \"hard\" on me than a traditional bike. You still feel the impacts, but a lot of the force is taken out of them. That makes the ride much more comfortable.

My manager asked me to stay for one more quarter, and as I continue working, day by day, I keep getting affirmations on my decision. I also wanted to leave on good terms, and continue to serve my Members well. In the last few weeks, I've received many compliments and awards at work. I was even recognized with a Challenge Coin from the local Police Department because I prevented someone from getting scammed. I also kept reading articles that reminded me it's OK to temporarily leave the work force. My Mother, however, was not very supportive.

For me, the strange part, is that I actually am taking the time to write it down.  The dream started with me laying on my childhood bed.  My mother in the next room started complaining about the noises outside her window and how she was trying to sleep.  I peaked out of my window and looked  towards the neighbors ' house, not much noise coming from there.  I decided to go outside and see what else was going on.  Ahh, this must be what she's barking about, a father showing his son how to use the recycling bins.   \"It's nothing Mom!\"  I yelled as I headed back to the bed room.  In that instant I remember being semi conscious it was a dream and a voice, either my own, or maybe even the father outside made a comment somehow unknowingly on the situation: \"See when you work for 30 years, you earn the money to build a life for you so that you can enjoy your life after.\" Unlike my mother's situation where she lay in bed jobless, complaining.  I went in the living room and noticed drawers full of pink starburst, \"Just like in real life.\"  I thought, knowing I bought a bag about a week ago, having a brief second of knowing that this was all a dream.   Shortly however I was back to being unaware.  I thought about our neighborhood and what it would look like with a lake.   \"We could shoot all kind of game!\" Explained a man who was suddenly in my living room.  I asked \"Do you think they would stock it with bass?\"  Figuring a hunter would know such things.  \"Of course!\" He replied.  I then realized that this was all a daydream.   To which point I thought if I told my mother she would try it and relax for a bit.  It kept going but I think this is a good summary for now!", "label": "recalled", "group": "9A8H9MJ8"}

It seems so much more important and different than when she moved to the dorm.  The dorm was strictly for two semesters whereas the apartment is a year long lease that ends after her next school year starts.  This is the beginning of her being even more grown up and on her own.  She will most likely never live with us full time ever again.  The moment is filled with pride, seeing how she has grown and going after her dream.  She is an amazing person.  Empathetic, loyal, a great example to her younger siblings, still painfully shy, yet emerging as this fiercely independent young woman who is willing to step out of her comfort zone to overcome the obstacles she encounters, one who knows she has value and a right to be seen as equal.  Last school year her younger sister attended the same college.  They lived in separate wings of the same dorm.  I liked the comfort of knowing she had her best friend available at all times.  This time is different as her sister has decided to change colleges and is at home for this year.  She is off campus, attending events at night where she makes her way to her apartment without the security escort the college has available for those living on campus.  She has worked out a good system to ensure her safety.   She is learning to juggle her studies with the demands of keeping up a living space and shopping and cooking all her meals.

It was the first time I was on my own, really on my own and I had to make friends and interact with a lot of people which makes me nervous. I've always wanted to just do my own thing while in school, I never liked doing group projects or having to get up and make a speech. In college, all of these issues I have in school, I would have to be doing in order to pass my classes and in order to graduate. The first few years in college were so stressful and hard that I thought about quitting a lot. Luckily, I made some friends and they helped me get through these difficult moments. I wouldn't participate in group projects and would pretend sick all the time and I would never volunteer to make a speech in front of my class or raise my hand to answer questions. I always sat in the back and focused on myself and my own work. The last few years my friends and my family came to my aid many times and without their help, I wouldn't have been able to work in group projects or raise my hand in class. With my friends and my family helping me through the years, they taught me to get passed my fears and go all in. That's exactly what I did, I made myself do uncomfortable things that could get me through my public fears. My friends and family helped me work hard and even tutored me throughout the years. I really didn't think I would be able to conquer these fears I had in college. I felt like they overrun my life and that I would have to seek professional help in order to get through them, which I didn't have the money for. I even told my friends and family how I felt and I told them not to help because there is no way I would get over these fears and I probably wouldn't graduate because these fears held me back. My friends and family eventually talked me into letting them try to help. I didn't think they were helping at first but as the years went on, they never gave up on me and I made sure, since they were taking their time to help me, I would put all my effort into letting them help me and not to give up.

It was an intense, tremoring pain --- the kind you'd experience during a boxing match or worse, during surgery without numbing. Being that I suffer from anxiety and am getting up there in age, I began to worry. Was this very serious? I contemplated my options all the while suffering. Do I go to the ER? A local Urgent Care? I tried everything I could think of to numb the pain. It was almost as if I was bitten by a poisonous creature. Was it a spider bite? So many things raced through my mind. Eventually, I realized the inside of my mouth was irritated. This was possibly from spicy food or acid reflux, and that it appeared to be possibly infected.

One of my favorite memories of that day was being seated alongside several of my friends, where we could see the newlywed couple together. None of us had seen my cousin dress so nicely before. In fact, most of us knew him as a fairly slovenly man, who rarely shaved and often had messy hair. His appearance become a source of merriment for us and we soon began making jokes about the way he looked. One friend adopted a rigid demeanor and did a funny impression of my cousin. Another friend, my cousin's old college roommate, found some old pictures of my cousin on his cell phone and used an app to stitch together some pictures from college with pictures from that day to make a series of \"before and after\" photos. A third friend remembered my cousin telling him that he would never wear a suit in his life and we all laughed at that recollection. When my cousin and his wife made their way to our table, we shared the jokes with the couple. His wife found my friend's impression of my cousin to be especially humorous. My cousin laughed when he saw the before and after pictures, though I think he may have been a little embarrassed, too. Still, despite that embarrassment, he knew everything was in good fun and without malice. When I think back to that day, the joking we shared at that table was is my most vivid memory. I suspect my friends would agree. I think that is why my cousin and his wife sat us all together that day. I think they wanted us to have as much fun as possible.", "label": "imagined", "group": "SCKBNZF6"}

I was worried in the beginning about her being in the airport and changing planes but she did it all with no problem. She stayed for 6 weeks and had so much fun. She visited all the major sites in Hollywood and even went to Disneyland. It was hard not having her at home when I'm used to seeing her everyday. I didn't have anyone to take care of on a daily basis and that was weird for me. I missed her laugh and her smile. I missed her company everyday. I thought she would be so busy and glad to be away that I wouldn't hear from her much. I thought I would be the one trying to get a hold of her to check in. I was very surprised when that wasn't the case. She was texting me from the time she was in the airport and everyday after that. Sometimes she would text me several times a day to tell me what they were doing. She really wanted to share everything with me and even ask my advice sometimes.

The most memorable thing about the wedding was the video they played about my cousin and her husband's history. It was well put together and emotional. Once it got dark the heat wasn't so bad, and at least the portable bathrooms they provided were air conditioned. It was only an hour away from where I live too so it was an easy drive back and forth. They offered hotels for any guests who wanted to stay the night, but I'd rather sleep in my own bed. It was definitely a memorable night.

It is unreal when something so painful happens, that you think will never happen. I also never knew the strength of negative emotions I could feel. I thought I knew pain before, but I was never remotely close to feeling real pain. There were many sleepless nights spent crying, and feeling like I was just going to fall over and die. The extreme anxiety and panic attacks I experienced were terrible. I look back wondering how I made it through. After surviving the worst time period of my life I learned that I can take something awful and get some good form it. I think the only way to survive something so bad it to find a way to see something good come from it. I am able to help others, and connect with other bereaved parents who have helped me survive. I can be that person who saves someone from going down the wrong path to handle grief. There have been a couple people who were here for me in that way. That is the best way to handle a bad situation. You have to find something positive to take from it, and use it in a good way.", "label": "retold", "group": "XBUM4VEM"}

His umbilical cord was tied in a complete knot, and he was not getting the life-sustaining support he needed as a result. Even though he was early, he thrived. I wasn't at all surprised because he was utterly active in the womb, which is probably how he ended up in the situation he was in. He spent every waking moment kicking and keeping me awake. He's very much like this now! My husband told me that when they took him, he was blue and not breathing. They quickly got him breathing, and though I was completely out at the time, I feel in my heart that I could hear his first cries. Even though this memory was not something solidly formed in my brain, it is something I know in my heart. This memory will stay with me forever. I am blessed to have him in my life.

We were joined by a close friend, who came in from out of state. This year was different, because we finally lived close enough to the event that we didn't have to camp the entire weekend; we could go home each night, shower, and sleep in an actual bed. This was great because it gave us a chance to start each day refreshed, as opposed to previous years, when the camping would leave us grimy and sore. I also could get a full night's sleep because we didn't have campers nearby keeping us up with their assorted activities. The acts announced this year were not nearly as exciting as previous years, save for a few big names. However, we were still excited at the prospect of finding new bands to enjoy. In the week leading up to the festival, the weather was mostly rain and storms, which started to worry me; even though we weren't camping, we would still be outdoors all day, and I didn't want to spend the weekend standing in rain and mud. However, the rain let up going into the weekend, and save for a few light showers one or two days, the weather was perfect the whole weekend. The music was great, as always, and it was nice to be able to spend a weekend with my girlfriend and our friends, without having to worry about work or other responsibilities. After everything was over, I was very tired and a little bit unhappy at the prospect of having to go back to work the following day, but overall, I was happy to have had a good weekend out.

Because I had no insurance at the time, I could not get it seen to by a doctor. Anyway, fast forward 4 decades (I'm 64 now) and have bone on bone arthritis in my right ankle joint. I was in a lot of pain daily and was having trouble walking any distance. So, in April of this year I, found a doctor who actually does ankle REPLACEMENT surgery. Now, prior to about 5 years ago, this was unheard of and the only thing available was a fusion of the ankle bone, which is probably why I did not have anything done earlier. The surgery is so new, that there are no predictions as to how long the joint will last, because there is no long term data yet. But, in April I took the plunge and had my right ankle replaced. Although the recovery is said to last up to a year (I'm 4 months in), I am walking without pain for the first time in years. I was unable to bear weight for one month and have had three months of physical therapy retraining my ankle to walk again. I still have a long way to go to recover my balance when walking and doing the kind of hiking and walking I love to do, but I feel it will all be worth it in the long run. When I have fully recovered, I should have 98% mobility in my ankle, which is a far cry from a fusion. I am very thankful I waited for the right time and technology to come along.

We arrived at the venue around 6:30pm, as the booking agent had requested for a sound check. The venue was beautiful, and as it turns out, has a great reputation and is a valued spot to get into. We set up, ran our sound check with most of the band, except our new saxophone player. She showed up a bit later, but still in time to get some sort of sound check. She asked about dinner and myself and our two singers handed her a menu. I told her that her meal is compt, but her boyfriends would not be. This was the first time any of us had ever seen her boyfriend, or even heard of him existing, but we didn't think too much of it because she'd only been playing with us for a few months. We all eat, then it's show time. We play our first set, the people love it, so does the booking agent. We take a set break, then return to the stage for set 2 of 3 for the night. Also well received.  We take our second set break, and suddenly, our saxophone player says she has to go and didn't know we were playing \"so late\".This seemed very strange to all of the rest of us, as the whole show should be done in another hour, which still would be relatively early, by usual musician standards. Her announcement was made even more strange by her \"boyfriend\" standing arms crossed, looking very menacing at everyone, telling her repeatedly, \"we got to go\". She seemed under duress. Her mouth was saying things that didn't match up to her body language. This made things very uncomfortable for everyone, except her boyfriend, who was bad vibing everyone.

I am enrolled in a Medical Lab Tech program at a college. I have already finished the core class requirements for the program, and am now engaging in clinical rotations. These rotations take place at local hospitals. I essentially go in, as if I am a regular employee, and learn how to do the job with other working employees. Unfortunately, there is no pay for this, but the idea is that the experience will pay for itself. Once of the classes I had to take was Microbiology. The class itself was tough, and a little confusing. It was essentially a long list of organisms, and the media that is used to grow the organisms. So, a lot of memorization. Now, and for the past six weeks or so, I have been doing my clinical rotation in the Microbiology department. The surprising thing that I have found is that the job itself isn't nearly as confusing as the class led me to believe that it would be. Granted, there is a massive amount of knowledge that is required to be known, but there are tons of reference materials at hand, and the use of them is heavily encouraged. The job is basically a desk job. I did not expect that. The employees in the Microbiology department work at one of six stations. The stations determine the type of work that will be performed for that day. The work that they will be doing for the day is laid out in front of them at the beginning of the shift, and once it is completed, they are basically finished working for the day, and just do extra things until the shift ends.

We went down to the Keys to celebrate a long year of hard work and take some time off together and finally get some quality time. We went down under the water the first day, after a few alcoholic beverages (of course). The fish were awesome, the life was so colorful, but no color more intense than the sunburn I had when we finished up! Oh boy, did I make a mistake forgetting to put on sunscreen that day. I came out like an infrared camera on a hot cherry cobbler -- I am talking molten red. I remember saying, \"well, I'm gonna pay for this hard later on tonight!\" By the night time, I decided that if I drank more iced beverages it might keep my mind off of the sunburn, and, surprisingly, that worked well for a while. Sleeping was hell on Earth, though, as I had to lay on ice packs borrowed from the resort desk to even close my eyes. Luckily, the burns subsided rather quickly, and simply glowed an awful red for a few days before turning into a nice tan. Thankfully for me, I've always had a good ability to recover quickly from sunburns. Perhaps that's why I always forget about sunscreen? Hmm, I don't know, but it wasn't fun. After that fiasco, we got to do much more of what we had planned, enjoying snorkeling and swimming and honestly just a lot of relaxing. It was really great even if I did get destroyed by the Sun.", "label": "imagined", "group": "KTIR9Z6J"}

I had not thought about this friend in a long time since we had gone our separate ways once we were in college. It\u2019s not that we were not good friends and I didn\u2019t like her, we had just fallen out of touch over time. This text led to a pretty long conversation over text about what we had been up to in life, where we had been, what we\u2019re doing. We were catching up and it felt like no time had passed since we last spoke. It was great to get back into the swing of talking to her again so easily. This conversation led to another, which led to another, which led to us making plans to meet for beers, which led to us now talking to each other pretty regularly and seeing each other a couple of times a week. Since we became so close so fast, I am starting to wonder what life would have been like if we had never stopped talking and being friends in the first place. Or maybe this falling out of touch let us grow as people and we were destined to be in each other\u2019s lives now instead of an ongoing thing. We\u2019ve grown a lot as people over time and now we are much more compatible than we used to be. I actually kind of like her, and I\u2019m starting to think she may feel the same way about me.

He came into my office one morning and slid a folded piece of paper on my desk.

I opened the paper and saw that it contained information regarding my promotion to a level 3 administrator. The change in levels pleased me since I was already performing level 3 job duties and felt that it was long overdue. The folded paper also held information regarding my pay raise and the percentage increase. This information fell a bit flat to me because it was much less than I had originally anticipated a promotion would bring. I received the same percentage increase for my promotion that I typically do for my annual raise. Seeing that lower number disappointed me, but I felt I couldn't show my supervisor my disappointment because he was so happy. Showing my disappointment would have been a slap in the face to my supervisor. He felt that he had done me a solid and the promotion, as well as the pay increase, was quite fair.

I am heading home from work when I was hit from behind in my car by somebody not paying attention. This was always a possibility, with driving for work each day, but I always thought my defensive driving strategies and confidence in my abilities would be able to avoid it. But, sometimes, other factors play a role in my life experiences. The damage to my car was heart-breaking to see, because I knew what was to come.      The accident caused my car to be totaled, along with my confidence on the road. The driver was not helpful, he did not care and lied to my face and to the police officer. This made me angry, and lowered my trust even further in people, which is already very low. The funds, I had been saving would now need to be used for a car, which was not part of any plan. All the time and effort spent on saving, seems to have been for nothing, and once again I feel like a failure due to this financial situation.     Then, my luck seemed to change, the car was quoted by an insurance agent and I received a lot more money then I thought for the car. I was happy again, but that withered away as I began searching for a replacement car. I was forced to take on more bills and even more worry. On the plus side, I finally have a decent car that is nice and dependable, but my confidence and anxiety are in a rough place.     I am now even more worried about driving, and damages to my new car that I have to pay a lot money for many years.

As a family, we have been through a lot. Our oldest was born with severe food allergies and he would scream for six to seven hours a day. He eventually outgrew much of this but our second child, a daughter, also had some issues with food allergies. Needless to say, my wife and I were a bit stressed over the prospect of a third child. The day of the birth came and my wife began having contractions. Now on our third child, the hospital trip was largely uneventful. We arrived and checked in and waited for her contractions to become more painful. It was around 3:00 am and we were both hoping that the day would be over sooner rather than later. Around 5:00 in the morning, my wife began to get closer and her water broke. From here on out, it was largely a waiting game for us. Our room was situated with a view of the Penobscot River. The sun began to slowly rise and it was the most spectacular view I have ever seen. Rays of sun casts pink and purple hues over the river and accented the landscape around the large town of Bangor, Maine. My wife had a doula on hand who also did photography of the event. The day was very special and stressful at times. After a couple hours of contractions, my wife's contractions intensified. Within the space of thirty minutes, she dilated to the point that she was ready for birth. The process itself was painful with no epidural. I helped encourage her through the birth of our son and prayed for. When our son was born, it was beautiful. Although he screamed as most newborns do, he quickly calmed down. He was able to nurse right away and for once it seemed like we had a happy baby.

One of my best friends was able to come to the ceremony, and both my wife and I were surprised a how excited and happy he was throughout the entire ceremony and reception. We took some photos after the ceremony, and our photographer was intent on getting the perfect photos. We had a large and very well-decorated venue for the reception. We had the perfect cake (that tasted as good as it looked) and a wonderful luncheon for all of the adults in attendance. Both my and my wife's parents got up and said a few words about us and our relationship over the years. We met when we were just teenagers, but we knew we wanted to be together all those years until we finally made it happen. She stayed with me even during a two year stint I spent in New York City, during which I was never able to visit and barely even got to talk with her. Our parents recounted several memories about us personally and together. My now brother-in-law, who was my best friend through high school and how I met my wife in the first place, was my best man. He also stood and said a few words, and it was very surprising how emotional he got as he spoke. He almost cried! I had never seen him get emotional about, well, anything!

It all began with a bunch of guest lecturers telling us their pieces and great advice in areas that they all specialize in. I was greatly informed on things that I never had considered before. After that, we were informed we'd all participate in a contest against each other! It was split up into a bunch of teams, 3 on each team, and I was very nervous and didn't think I had a shot at all in winning the prize. I tried my very best and really kicked my own butt, and somehow myself and my teammates miraculously won over the other team! It was certainly because I had put forth my best effort, since I was the one who clinched the win with my breakneck sprint at the end. I still can't believe we had done it!

When it was time to head out to the game, I almost expected John to be in a nice suit and clean-shaven. I walked downstairs to meet up with him and found that he was wearing his typical fan jersey and he was wagging a huge #1 finger around excitedly. My heart sank, and I realized that, maybe, I was wrong. I was shocked! Suddenly felt kind of stupid being all dolled up. John jokingly told me I was way overdressed, and I grumbled something about how I thought he was going to propose to me tonight. He looked surprised, and his face changed. John told me that he will propose eventually, but I need to let things happen more organically. He wants it to be a surprise, and if I was able to guess it so easily, the experience might not be the same. At first, I was pretty upset and I couldn't figure out what he was talking about but I thought about it a little bit and realized he was right. This wasn't the first time I tried to push the situation, and I guess I was being a little overzealous about getting married.

It had the participation of so many incredible female illustrators and I was thrilled they all wanted to be part of the project. A few days before the actual release, one of the artists announced the project early on their social media. They happened to be one of the more prominent artists, and that led to a lot of buzz that we were not entirely prepared for. So we had to scramble to announce the project early, since it would otherwise have impacted potential sales. It was really incredible to see all the posts on social media that were about the project, and it was amazing to see how popular it was on our own social channels, in comparison to our other posts. It showed how valuable it is to have diverse voices that are concerned with social issues. While it has not been the career burst I am may have hoped for, it has led to some very cool opportunities.

I was almost overwhelmed, but my wife and I always wanted a family, and this had been years in the making. Honestly, some of my first thoughts were, \"Can I do this? Am I going to be a capable father?\". My wife helped me put those thoughts to rest quick, and the joy of having my son around drowned out those types of thoughts quickly when my family and my wife's family showed up to support us, as well as our friends. The amount of support was really incredible. I don't think we had to buy a thing for 3 months as people came in in droves to support us it seemed. I'm a family man now,  and I love it.", "label": "imagined", "group": "KTIR9Z6J"}

I thought I'd had experiences with losing sleep before, but nothing has ever compared to this. Even being healthy, early birth aside, I couldn't help but feel something could and would go wrong at any moment. I was constantly on edge, thinking some nurse would come in to tell me he'd taken a turn for the worse. All of this and overall environment made it impossible to get anything resembling a solid night's sleep. I'm sure I got some, since I wouldn't be alive right now to write this if I hadn't. But, it felt like I may as well have awake the whole three weeks. I also got very accustomed to the taste of hospital food and the beeping of machines. That could maybe be considered a life skill in future situations I hope I'm never in again. I was lucky to have my family around for support, at least. Although I'm sure I acted more than a little nuts to them, they managed to put up with me regardless. I don't know if I've ever had a moment of pure relief more powerful when the doctors told me he was ready to come home, and was doing fine. I was grateful that me and my partner's family offered to stay over for a while, since I don't think I would've gotten much more sleep at home the first few nights without them. When I finally got in my own bed, I slept like a brick. Waking up knowing my son was safe and healthy had to be the best feeling I've ever had.", "label": "imagined", "group": "VBWJQWQ0"}

Our destination was cliche, but we went to California, and we went to the beach. Not just one beach, beaches all along the state. We even went as far as the border between California and Oregon. It was beautiful to see such a sight. Some of the beaches were dirty, unkempt, and even downright trashy. But most of the ones we went to were simply beautiful. We collected seashells, took millions of pictures, laid out in the sun, got ice cream, and just did all the fun things we've wanted to do for so many years.

We had to decide on an exact date so we started getting everyone's schedules together. It was going to be hot but August was the choice! It was too expensive to fly so we chose to drive. Took us 10 hours to get there. Weather was very nice. We went to the big water park first, Volcano Bay. The kids loved it. The next day we stayed and hung out at the resort and swam in the pool mostly. We played some games and went bowling. Next two days we went to Universal Studios park and then Adventure Island.

Eventually I was dropped off on the curb while my family went to find parking. Inside the venue, security was as chaotic as the parking. There were over 1500 people being naturalized and 3 airport-style security checkpoints. The wait was long and it made me even more anxious. There were tannoy announcements that everyone in the room at this time would be found a space in the naturalization ceremony, but that didn't do anything to calm me down when I was 1000 people back in line. Finally through the security, the actual event hall was also incredibly unorganized. Go to this table, no actually that table, to get your packet, then sit here. Why are you sitting there?! Finally, with minutes to spare I was in my seat and reading my documents. I was still stressed though because my family was still looking for parking and not yet in the building. I was sweating and my heart was racing, what should have been a memorable day was turning out to be memorable for all the wrong reasons.  When the ceremony finally began, all that faded away. The judge welcomed us all to the US, and mentioned our responsibilities as citizens. We all took the oath and then they played the national anthem and a music video. By this point I was in tears - tears of joy. Tears of relief. Tears of belonging (is that a thing?).The day was a mess, the venue should be ashamed of the way they 'organized' it all.

I was sitting in the parking lot working on some reports and enjoying the unusual lack of activity. As I sat in the car with my windows rolled down, snacking on some beef jerky, I heard a soft thump from the roof of the car. I looked around, shining my flashlight through the empty parking lot and seeing nothing. As I turned back to my computer I noticed a small grey cat perched on the hood of my car. We stared at each other for a moment, silently. The cat slowly approached the windshield glass, never breaking eye contact. The silence was interrupted by the sound of my radio screeching. As I turned away to adjust the volume, the cat jumped from its perch on the hood to suddenly hop through the open window and into my lap. Startled, I offered her a piece of the beef jerky still in my hand, which she happily accepted. We continued silently munching jerky for several minutes. Just then my partner pulled up. He asked, what are you doing with a cat? I said that I wasn't certain, that the cat had just appeared and invited herself into my car. My partner laughed and said could he pet the cat too. I said sure. But the cat would not go to him. She seemed content to hang out in my car the entire evening. As my shift continued, I took the cat with me to each call, leaving the windows down so she could leave if she wanted to. She never left. By morning, I accepted that the cat had simply adopted me and that was that. I took the cat home, searched extensively for its owner, but couldn't find any trace of one. The cat is still with me, having moved in and made herself right at home. She settled right into life at my house. We couldn't be happier.

He had a knack of making me laugh and feel good about myself and whatever was going on at that time. Aside from making me feel emotionally stable, safe, and secure, he also made me feel very secure financially. He made it look so easy, as if I would never have to worry about money ever again. He made me feel that I could trust him with no matter what. This is perhaps the reason that I married him in the first place, because of how he good he made me feel about myself: very safe, secure, and sound", "label": "recalled", "group": "AK7VTZTK"}

I was in the newpaper and on the facebook page of local town.  Pretty weird although I don't remember anything that happened from just before I went down to a week later.

I am shocked that my son held it together to revive me.  If not for him being home I would have died.  I would have had no chance at all.

He died in an assisted living facility for people with Parkinson's and other chronic mental issues. He wasn't getting any better, only worse. He was diagnosed a couple of years ago, and had become immobile in the last six months. The last time I visited him, he couldn't move or speak: he was frozen in a clenched, tense state, and his face literally looked like Edvard Munch's \"The Scream\" (I kid you not!). He looked so empty. It was so depressing I never went back and secretly hoped he'd pass away sooner rather than later. Now that he has, I feel very depressed and a little angry that none of us were there for it, and that there isn't a more dignified way for us to leave this world. I don't understand why when a person reaches that state, his family can't choose to plan his death so that they could all be there to say goodbye one last time. I mean, he was like a plant: they fed and bathed him, washed and changed him. No one could even tell us if he was still understanding anything we were saying. It just seems more just to me to plan his exit: pick a date so we could all be there for the entire day with him. Then, at some point, the doctor could just give him an overdose of morphine or something. But I guess that is inhumane, unlike letting someone slowly waste away in a strange place with no family and trapped inside a body that no longer works. Some things just make no sense. I just hope when my day comes that if it isn't quick and sudden, I still have enough wherewithal to take care of it myself-- because no one else is going to.", "label": "recalled", "group": "9A79N1JC"}

He looked so peaceful, and when he got a little fussy, it was so strange to see his gums as he opened his mouth. It reminded me that the beginning of our lives and end of our lives are quite similar. We barely have any teeth, we are weak, and need our loved ones to take care of us. I wondered what kind of personality my nephew would have, despite him not showing much at all. Would he be like his father, my brother, who is kind at heart but not the most mature in many other ways? Or would he be like his mother, who is quite the diva? My question was soon answered as he went to get fed, but suddenly became inconsolable. He simply would not stop crying, unless someone held him. The moment he was laid down in his crib, he would burst out, wailing again. This continued for almost an hour before his parents decided to take him for a walk. I began to see that this is what my parents did for my brother and I, yet they had significantly less resources than us. It made me appreciate that they balanced their work and taking care of us - all the sacrifices we didn't see, we couldn't possibly fathom, until now.

The supplement is also used to support liver function and help alleviate neuropathy.  Upon taking recommended a dosage, I developed back pain. As a scientist, I began scouring medical literature as well as watching biomedical presentations. I began a intellectual journey in learning about the body's mechanisms for detoxification. One of the most important scientists to help educate me in this area was Dr. Christopher Shade, CEO of Quicksilver Scientific (a company that specializes in biological testing of toxins and supply of carefully formulated nutriceuticals designed to help promote detoxification.  Through Dr. Shade, I bean to understand the body;s complex and intricately choreographed mechanisms for identifying, tagging, mobilizing, and eliminating toxins from the body. In addition, I learned about environmental factors that could lead to a block in detoxification. In my case, my medical history and symptomology supported a block in detoxification created by a significant exposure to toxic mold. As it turns out, mold biotoxins can block the body's ability to clear a number of toxins, including heavy metals, and that without removal of this block, use of other methods that stimulate portions of the detox process (such as alpha lipoic acid), may be hindered.  This can put undue stress on the liver and kidneys.  Fortunately, Dr. Shade also was instrumental in recommending a simple dietary remedy to this mold toxin-induced block to detoxification. After a very short amount of time, my troubles were greatly diminished. I am grateful to Dr. Shade for his knowledge  and insight, which has enabled me to proceed in a lifestyle of detoxification as well as identify mold biotoxin as a source of many of my chronic health issues.", "label": "recalled", "group": "OMOB0KLB"}

I've always been an introverted person by nature. Due to my generally unsociable personality, I was skeptical about the extroverted and bombastic vibe of a festival. I wasn't convinced I could click with a large community of strangers given my temperament. I knew however that going to such an event could be what I needed to break out of my shell. I was shocked at the kindness directed towards first-timers and how easy it was to integrate into the community. The general theme of the festival was one of self-regulation - there was no central authority or rules. Thus, there was a general theme of unchecked hedonism, essentially people were left to their own devices and allowed to do whatever they wanted. The only real rule was simply to not attack or detriment the community, which was left to police itself. It reminded me of anarcho-communist, de-centralized conceptual communities, but in this regard I was able to watch those ideas play out in person. The festival was peaceful and a fun time for everyone involved despite the lawless nature of it and it made me optimistic that ideas like these could succeed on a larger scale. I was able to express myself in ways I had never gotten to previously. It stripped me of my gut apprehension towards things like public nudity by it being so ubiquitous that it resulted in desensitization. I also had an apprehension towards hedonic things like public sex and open drug use, but it was so wide-spread that it became a footnote, like background noise. Exposing myself to a culture like that opened my mind and expanded my capabilities for tolerance towards others and behavior that runs contrary to my own day to day experience. Thus, I think the extreme nature of that festival made me a more robust and tolerant person, and less tightly-wound.", "label": "recalled", "group": "AXP41N10"}

But, tonight, we decided to go back to our roots. Luckily, I had the perfect restaurant in mind. There is this little hole-in-the-wall Italian place that my parents used to take me to when I was young. So, as I knew the wine would flow that night, we took an Uber to the location. It was absolutely perfect as I rented out the whole restaurant (and made sure I tipped the wait staff accordingly. There were lights, there were cheesy Italian songs, it was great. We got there, sat down, and had some bread and some sort of antipasto to start. We managed to get through most of a bottle of the house wine before we even reached the main course. Now I definitely said we were going back to our roots so these were very basic meals. I had a simple carbonara while she had fettucini alfredo. Both were divine as we tasted each other's dishes. After a few more glasses of wine and some incredible cannoli we went back to our house to enjoy some incredibly expensive champagne and some incredibly passionate sex.

I finally decided to contact my friend who is an interior designer, to talk to me about options and budget. I told her that my top budget was $10,000 and she said that that was do-able. So, I went ahead and hired her. She was to help with design and project manage the remodel. Her contractors came over to measure etc, and I received the quote, which ended up being $10,000 PLUS the cost of all the new appliances/fixtures. i was a little frustrated as she knew my total budget was $10,000 but the new estimate would be around $14,000. I cut a few costs where possible, but we went ahead with it. I had told her the sort of countertop i wanted, but when it came time to select the countertop, the ones I wanted were double what i had initially been quoted, therefore I had to compromise and go for a cheaper countertop. My friend also gave me a presentation with several options of fixtures to chose from (sink/faucet/lighting) and i was surprised that most of the options were more than i had initally been quoted. In the end I was happy with the remodel, however disappointed in how much over budget we went. I also felt a little taken advantage of by friend. I wish she had been more upfront about the total cost, as she surely would have known given she does this for a living. Also, I had to tell some small white lies to my husband who was firm on the $10,000 budget.

I like kids but at that point, I didn't just want one to disturb my peaceful ride back home. I brought out my phone and starting checking Reddit for the popular posts on that day. The seat next to me was still empty. I didn't know what made me look far right, beyond an elderly man was this lady on glasses. Her nose came out a little than the other girls I know. Just when I was praying that she looks sideways so I see what she looks like, she turned sideways. I froze at the spot. It took about 10 seconds to caution myself that I've been staring way too much. Those 10 seconds were the most enchanting moment of my life. The elderly man seated next to her left and maybe not wanting to sit alone, she came to sit just beside me.  I can't say maybe it was the scent of her that made my nervous that one word could not leave my already slightly opened lips or that I didn't expect her to make that move.

He initially started his college career at the main University and was struggling. I convinced him to start his schooling at the local community college to help with the transition. He objected at first, he thought it would look like he failed, but it turned out to be the best decision that he made. He met a professor there that inspired his passion for the Pharmacy school. I really think his path via community college helped shape his direction into getting accepted to Pharmacy school. His older brother (Albert) also played a huge role in helping and support. I was very emotional knowing that the two brothers were working together and that Albert was excited to see Samuel with him at school.

We really felt like kids, walking around with our custom-made wands, waving them to cast spells.  I was surprised that we weren't the only people there with no children.  I guess kids of all ages love Harry Potter!  We were pleasantly surprised by how delicious the food was while we were there.  Amusement park food has a reputation for being bland and greasy, but everything we ate or drank while we were there was outstanding.  We ate at the Leaky Cauldron and the Three Broomsticks, of course, but we also tried several restaurants and snack stands in other parts of the park.  Everything was fresh and tasty.  There were even healthy options available at several places, something that can be very difficult to find at theme parks.  The variety of souvenirs available was also impressive.  Most of the time, parks will have the same items scattered across numerous different shops, but each store at Universal had its own theme and unique items.  We did see some repeats, but most places had their own things.  We finally had to start taking photos of items and labeling them with the name of the store, since we wanted to see everything before we made our final decisions on purchases.  We were able to ride all of the rides and attractions we wanted to experience while we were there, and got to ride many of them more than once.  We were very surprised by the short wait times, even on popular rides.  There were a couple of times that we were able to walk directly onto the ride without having to wait at all!

We threw a party, nothing too crazy because of their mobility issues, but we had a bunch of family fly out and a few close friends too.

When he got downstairs he was pale, his foot falls seemed heavy, and he had this lost look on his face somewhere between a blank stare and scowl. He asked what everyone was doing here. We reminded him it was his anniversary and he seemed even more confused. He didn\u2019t even seem to recognize anyone except Mom. It was terribly awkward.

I went to work that day just like I normally do, but around two in the afternoon I got a call from my mom saying that she was taking my dad to the hospital because he was unable to remember things that were happening and things that he always remembered. I told her that since the school day was almost over I would finish out the day and then I would head to the hospital afterwards if they were still there. I finished the day out at work and immediately left school to head to the hospital because my mom said that we all needed to be there as soon as possible to talk about some things. When I got to the hospital I was taken up to the ICU, which was strange to me for someone that seemed to only be suffering from the flu. When I walked into my dad's room I was terrified. He had never looked as weak and out of it as he had that day. He didn't even know who I was. My mom had been crying I could tell, but  she didn't want to talk in front of my dad, so we all went in the hallway. When we got out of the room my mom completely fell apart and told us that my dad was suffering kidney failure. I was astounded because he never showed any signs of this before and was never told anything about this at doctor appointments. He was given 3 weeks to live. I was so scared and sad and I didn't know how to react, but only to believe that this couldn't be true. The next day my family and I spent the entire day hanging out with my dad in the hospital, although he was totally out of it by this point.

We go hiking in the mountains, catching fish on the rivers nearby and we have had so much activities there. It was so unforgettable.  We were so happy with my family.  It was really a blast for me.

After pizza me and niece and her little brother started to play catch with a ball. This only lasted for about five minutes until she became distracted with some slime so we played that too. She then convinced me to lay barbies with her, so we went up to her room and got what seemed like all the barbies in the world and a giant barbie bus. When we came back to the party it was cake time. My niece had chosen a giant ice cream cake, but her dad had decided to put those trick candles on it so she was huffing and puffing for what seemed like five minutes, until finally all the candles had been blown out. After cake we had a large dance party. I was swinging her around and throwing her in the air and it was a great time. We probably danced for about ten minutes before it was time to open up some presents. So she opened her presents and super exited with all the unicorns and books about mermaids she received.

So i thought i would take a shower early before he was able to lock me  into  a conversation and i  would have to speak to my  brother and look into the eyes of a brother i had lost years ago. In order to understand my situation, as the reader you have to understand that his manic episodes come in packages; Anger, Sadness and euphoria. I wasnt sure what emotion was  going to come out tooday so i decided to get in the  shower. As im getting  in the shower the dooor knob starts to rattle. I immediately know its my  brother but i act like i dont know who  it is. \"hello!?\" i call out. The doorknob begins to rattle even more viciously than before. i call out once more and bang the door \"HELLO!?\". As i open the door because the rattling wont stop its my brother, or is a shell of what he once was. He is unshaven, 100 lbs overweight and smells and looks like he hasnt showered in a week. I tell him  \"dude what the fuck?\" but he just stares at me and doesnt say a word. after about 10 seconds of awkward silence he says  \"im going to work today fucker\" and leaves me with an manical smille.

About 3 years ago we let one of my fiance's friends he's had since high school stay with us. There was no bedroom available, so he made a room for himself out of furniture and bedsheets in the large 'man cave' that is adjacent to the living room. I was slightly apprehensive about it because I knew he was a little moody at times, but agreed because he was our friend and would be paying us $200 in rent per month. For the first year or so things were going nicely, we were all happy (as far as I know), and friendly. Spending time together, helping each other out when needed, etc. But as time went on, our friend/roommate became more miserable. His job started early, so he wanted to come home and take naps at 3-4 in the afternoon, and that is a difficult thing to do when you are in a room made out of sheets, and there are two toddler boys in the next room. Also, the boys and I are always home, because I cannot drive, we live on a highway so it's not safe to walk anywhere, and my fiance is always at work, so it was like this every day. I don't work because daycare in the area I live for 2 toddlers cost more than what I made at my job! So this was happening every day. In addition to that, our friends would come over and stay late, and they were his friends too. Usually 1 to 2 times per week. So I guess he wasn't getting enough sleep. I say I guess, because this man, in addition to being moody, is very passive aggressive. So instead of talking to us about his issues, he would just walk by in silence, ignore me if I said hello to him, and just generally be bitter. He wasn't like that all the time though. Sometimes he would be like that, and just a few hours later be kind and talkative. So over time, he became more and more bitter and confusing, helping us out like friends less and less, and isolating himself more and more. And was friendly mostly when he was drunk. Eventually he started blaming me for my children being loud in the day, and even telling them to shut the f--- up sometimes! So about two weeks ago the situation came to its head, and my fiance had it. He told him that he has been mean to us and our children, a bad friend, and that he needs to move out. It is sad, because they have been friends since they were 15, and I know he will hold animosity towards us. I feel bad for him though, because he always has these kinds of problems with people.", "label": "recalled", "group": "BU7B9LZM"}

I had brought a tent for my girlfriend and I to use, but I was glad that we were able to sleep in the camper instead because of the heat and humidity. During the trip we went fishing, canoeing, kayaking, and floating down the river. The water was pretty fast at times, but that made it even more exciting for us. Even though the weather was a little too hot, I was thrilled to spend some time with my girlfriend and her family. We have been together for two years, and our relationship has been a long distance one for the majority of that time. Because of this, I do not get to see her as often as I would like. We enjoyed the trip so much that we are thinking about going back to the same place some time in the near future. I would love to go in the fall (because it wouldn't be as hot), but if we want to go back when the weather is warm, I think we would have to go about a month earlier than we did. Overall, it was a great bonding experience for us all. My girlfriend and I cannot wait to go back. We had so much fun.

I follow her on instagram, and for many months i was daydreaming about what she could do for my kitchen. It was dated and dark, with a brown granite countertop and a horrible brown mosaic tile backsplash. It was the original kitchen from when the house was built in 1999. I gave her my ideas and told her my budget was $10,000 and she had her contractors come over and we ended up with a estimate of around $10,000 plus the cost of the appliances i wanted to buy. I needed a new cooktop, sink, faucet, pendant lighting and i wanted to put in a wine fridge. I decided to go ahead with it, and I was able to go with my friend to pick out the new counter top as well as the back splash tile, which was very exciting. There were so many options which is what i needed my friend for. Construction began just a couple of weeks ago, and we had contractors in the house for about 9 days which was somewhat disruptive to my family, as we didn't have a kitchen for that amount of time. With two small children, that was a bit difficult to deal with. Anyhow, we managed to get by and ate a lot of takeout! When it was finally done, the kitchen looked amazing and I was so happy. I ended up with a white/grey veined quartz countertop, and a grey herringbone backsplash tile. My favorite part though is the pendant lighting and the wine fridge! I wasn't quite honest with my husband though, as the total cost ended up being $14,000 including all of the appliances.

We had no idea the trouble that was about to occur. We were told the surgery would only be about 30 minutes or so. So they wheel my mother to the back and give her anesthesia. From my knowledge, as I was not with her at this point, was that she was still awake when they wheeled her into the operating room and she began to have a panic attack when they put the surgery cloth or whatever you call it over her face which then lead her to have a pulmonary edema. A pulmonary edema is basically your lungs being filled with fluid making it very difficult to breathe. She was taken to the ICU immediately and remained there for about a week. She was able to make a full recovery but it was close to being an absolute disaster. It was one of the most frightening things I have ever experienced.

She couldn't feed herself, her memory was sketchy.  I went to visit her everyday and finally the staff and I started talking hospice care.  But before that could happen, I got a call at work that she was close to death.  I rushed to the hospital and she was barely conscious.  I arranged for last rites and sat holding her hand.  A few hours later, she slipped away.  I sat with her a bit longer before letting the nurse know.  I had papers to sign and then I left the hospital.  It was so strange leaving her there.  I just didn't know what to do.  But I had to call family to let them know and figure out the next steps.

It turned out she was fine but had accidentally turned off her cell phone. At that point I realized that I needed to move in with her. She needed someone to help her out a bit, and I needed the peace of mind of being with her. So within the span of a few days I decided to move in with her and then did. It was a difficult thing to do for me. I had lived by myself for over fifteen years. I wasn\u2019t used to living with someone else. On top of that, there were the ego-related feelings of being a pathetic adult living with his mother. I knew it was for the best for my mother, so I just had to deal with the negative aspects of the situation.

This last July the band reformed and traveled to Bogota, Colombia to play a show. It was fun and a bit surreal to reunite and work with the other members after all the time off. It was also pretty humorous to see how quickly we all settled in to our old behaviors. Traveling as a group can be stressful especially when you have to transport instruments that the TSA views with suspicion and attempts to disassemble, which is what happened to me. Thankfully I was able to get everything working for the concert.  We had a full day in Bogota before the show, which we spent hanging out with a promoter with whom we had worked before on a previous trip. He took us to local restaurants and record stores which we never would have stumbled on by ourselves. Then that evening there was a party at a record store in kind of a hipster area of town. After that we headed to a small jazz club where the drummer from the band we were sharing the bill with was playing. It was a small cafe with a prominently displayed triptych of chairman Mao. There are very good painters in Bogota and there are very elaborate murals to be seen everywhere and even the graffiti approaches high art. The show was a double bill with another band and took place in a very large 5000 seat auditorium, even though neither band had the capacity to draw that many people. Even though the whole organization was very professionally run, sound check seemed to last forever and resulted in my not being able to have lunch with an old friend who I hadn't seen for years. But the concert itself went well there was a good showing on the ground floor seats, but the balconies remained unused. Afterwards I was able to meet up with my friend and go out for some drinks. The day after the show was spent in the studio collaborating with the band with whom we had shared the bill, and felt like equal parts work and social occasion. Some friends of the other band who are foodie types, prepared a meal for everyone, and there was plenty of beer and wine and general frivolity. Our last day in Bogota was open so the guitarist and keyboardist and I went to the National museum, which is a sprawling, long and narrow building with lots of interactive exhibits on everything about Colombian culture past and present.  Afterwards we had lunch at a Peruvian restaurant which, ironically was some of the best food we had in Colombia. That was followed by lots of walking through flea markets and street fairs that spring up during the weekend.

We continued to be very discouraged as she lost more and more of her ability to speak. She also became more confused and needed help dressing. It was up to me to help her with all of these simple things that she used to be able to do for herself. We had some difficult days. Soon, my sister and I took her in for a lumbar puncture to see if any evidence of her leukemia would show up in her central nervous system (CNS) fluids. It did not, but then they weren't able to get a full sample and said the test results were negative but also somewhat inconclusive. We were frustrated and baffled. The local neurologists were all booked up and weren't able to see her immediately. Finally, after trying to contact more doctors we took her back in to the ER, one month after her initial brain MRI. This new MRI showed that she did indeed have a diffuse cancer in her brain, and moreso on the left side, though it was evident on both the left and right. It had grown very fast. CLL rarely spreads to the brain, but my Mom was an exception. Now we had an answer but what to do next? As the doctors laid out what sort of treatments, all chemo, could be provided and the possible side effects, and contrasted that against the fact that no treatment would cure her and only possibly extend her life by a few weeks, if that, we decided against any further treatment. We brought my mom back to my home at the end of July, straight from the hospital and hospice met us at the house to sign her up for home treatment.

It was not one moment of calm, it was total chaos and way too much energy for me. Especially the fact that I am a bit of a hypochondriac and my family and I were on an airplane for nearly 6 hours. Not too mention going to a climate that is much dryer and much more hotter and or coldrer depending on the time of day that where we live. I found myself feeling ill and just wanting to rest the whole time. Unfortunately with so many people in one big house there was no time for that. We managed to have an enjoyable time. We cooked together, watched movies together. The kids got off of their devices for a short time and actually played board games. I purchased my mom a champagne cake made by an award winning bakery (very expensive) because her birthday was in mid November. We were all very happy, and were appreciative that my mom is still with us. That week was the most memorable because it was a fun family time and I am not sure when it will happen again.", "label": "imagined", "group": "K19X65S1"}

We heard Rex barking from a distant and we went running towards the direction of the sound. We were happy to find Rex and Stacy together under a tree.  On asking Stacy why she didn't come back, she announced that her bike had spoiled and could not move. She trusted that somehow we would go looking for her. It was such a good moment and we loved Rex even more. We have even bought him a new collar. It has his name written on it.  Rex is so promising.   There was this memorable night when burglars came home and were about to break in. Rex with all his courage took on them and managed to pin one down who is helping the police with investigations. Rex has become one of us and we value him so much. He has proved to be a member of the family and with a lot of love. In many instances, Rex has proved to be capable beyond our expectations.      Though he is proving his ability, we intend to retain the trainer for the full time intended. Rex is one of the finest German Shepherd i have come across.

I thought that was a very nice park personally because everything was set up good. It was in a good location as well and everyone around us just really seemed to be in a positive mood and good spirits and I appreciated that so much. I thought that it was something I could really get into during my time there. My family was also pleasantly surprised in how well everything was going since we usually never take time out like that as a family to spend quality time with each other. Everything from my point of view was going absolutely perfect and nothing could ruin the day. We took time to take fun and exciting photo's, go see different things throughout the park and also meet up with other family members who were out there and connect with them. Needless to say this to me was really just what I would call a perfect day personally. I even got to eat some cotton candy, which honestly I never had cotton candy before so I was actually more pumped than I probably should have been when I was eating it, I never realized how good it was. Definitely a highlight for me throughout the experience along with that my family took a boat ride. The boat ride was really nice and relaxing especially because we all just seemed to be in good spirits throughout the trip and the ride just made everything even better. I never knew that spending time with your family like that could create such a nice environment. It was just very nice, the energy and vibes everyone gave off and the laughter we had, you just couldn't top that. I was so happy with how everything turned out I was even suggesting that we do it again some day.

My wife, our three kids, and my dad had all decided that they were going to treat me to a day of fun stuff tailored specifically to me. I'm not normally the type to indulge myself as I'm usually so busy taking care of others but I decided to just lean into everything and enjoy myself. We drove to downtown Los Angeles for a wonderful Italian lunch at Bestia. During lunch, I was struck by the free flowing nature of the conversation, the spontaneous bursts of irreverence and quirkiness that are emblematic of a close family. I was profoundly moved by the precocious nature of our kids interacting with my dad because it made me feel like a bridge between two generations of family. I could see very clearly how the best aspects of what my dad had taught me about being a parent were being passed down to his grandkids, who in turn were on their way to becoming well rounded adults. This illustrated itself vividly as we moved on to the after lunch event, a screening of Laurel and Hardy's classic comedy \"Sons of the Desert\", one of my all time favorites, and a movie that my Dad had shared with me when I was a child. I'd seen the move dozens of times I was enthralled by the hilarious comedy of errors unfolding onscreen but our kids were utterly and completely involved in that special way when one encounters timeless art. As they rolled in the aisles, doubling over from hysterical laughter, I felt a singular sense of joy and accomplishment. My dad had given me something precious, and after cultivating it for years I was handing it off to my kids for their own pleasure. It was then that I realized that beyond material gifts, what really matters on birthdays is reflecting on where you're going, who is going on the journey with you, and what we're all learning on the way there. As a kid, my dad always treated me as an intellectual equal because he figured that what I didn't understand would only pique my curiosity to learn more. In turn, I tend to do the same with my kids and the effect is the same. Their quest becomes something that we all get involved in and by doing so we all end up learning something about each other. This engenders closeness, and what I realized that day is just how close I feel to the people with whom I'm sharing this wonderful life with. To me that's the essence of family.", "label": "recalled", "group": "NV32QQEY"}

I just had a baby on August 5th Leilani you helped chose her name and now she will be too little to even remember how much you lived her. I have the memories though of you changing her evening though you were sick you still wanted to and she pooped in your hand. Then you changed her again and she pooped on you again. You thought it was funny and gross at the same time. I wonder now who in this world I will ever trust as much as you to watch them. You were my rock I love you and I miss you so much. I wish you knew how much I truly cared for you. You were my best friend and even though we had some doozy of arguments we always made up.

Our cabin would remain in the family. This was the most wonderful gift ever. While 2018 was awful, 2019 has been good to us.

I was homeless for 9 years in Hawaii because of the president during that time was trying to extort money from military families to fund his campaign about going to war against another country. I remember when I was 8 years old, seeing the Sheriff at our front door saying that we were going to be escorted out of our government house due to the fact that we were unable to make $3000. 00 within the week to give them. At the time I didn't know what this meant because I was so young. After we began to move out of our house, Reality began to make sense and the danger of the unknown future was beginning to weigh down upon the center of my consciousness. I grew up homeless, loosing everything that I ever owned over a weekend changed the way that I think and see things. I grew up in homeless shelters, living in the back of a car with my brother, sister, and mother who was at the time very frustrated with the way things were going, I didn't blame her. My mom never made good decisions afterwards. She picked the wrong people to trust and those people always took advantage of us. Those who were supposed to be apart of the Christian society are the most wicked people I have ever lived with. Taking the little money we had and abusing my mom in front of me makes me want to hunt them down and treat them in a similar way. I will not forgive them, nor forget them.

Nevertheless, we decided to proceed with our trip and hope for the best.

It was especially memorable for me, because I had not felt this much joy and togetherness, due to recent marital problems I had been experiencing. After a brief tour of the Falls, we decided to drive to our hotel on the Canadian side. We were slightly nervous, because of my wife's expired passport. Delightfully, the Canadian border patrol did not even notice. We proceeded to our hotel which had a wonderful view of the Falls. We spent two nights there, exploring every activity we could find time to do. Our next stop was Toronto. WE took the opportunity to try some great Chinese food before checking into our hotel. The highlight was visiting the CN tower and watching the sunset at the top. After a couple of nights, we started our journey back home. Again we became quite nervous at the border crossing.

We had to drive over 5 hours to get there by car, but it was not too bad since we split up the drive between us two. Anyways, while there, we also competed in a contest with over one hundred other individuals of varying levels of fitness! It was a crazy experience, and I was very nervous to perform in front of so many people, especially ones that were definitely more fit than me (at least they seemed to be). Some of these guys looked like they were bodybuilders and had been working out like that for many many years! I only happened to start the program just a year ago. I did put a lot of effort into the workouts leading up to this, but I definitely think I had my work cut out for me! Crazy enough though, I actually outperformed them and won first place! I was ecstatic and couldn't believe it. Little old me, who was half the size of most of the people there, on his first try did what seemed like the impossible. My friend told me that it was all the hard work I put in prior to this expo, which really made me feel happy and glad that I agreed to join him on this trip. What a great weekend!", "label": "recalled", "group": "GNP2WUGT"}

I was pleased to find that she was so deep into the process of creating this lipgloss line. Of course, I thought these were great ideas to start with. To start, we went to a nearby crafts and art supplies store and decided to spend much of the day browsing the extensive collection for what would work best. She already had her mind set on packaging that was bold and memorable. We looked first at the most striking colors and materials we could find. To my surprise, she was immediately taken by a combination of colors and materials, as though she had fully established in her mind the design she'd be going for. We selected our packaging supplies and were thrilled we had made it so far so efficiently. We then thought extensively about pricing. She had several ideas and was confident that they would work. I searched online for similar pricing models for makeup and lipgloss lines and quickly found that my daughter's ideas were in line with the common pricing trends. The whole day proved to be a success and I love that my daughter has finally found an aspect of her life she can be fully involved in and passionate about.

After many years of longing for this car, I had finally found an older model that I might be able to afford with a lot of budgeting. I was so excited. But because I couldn't get approved for a loan, the car was sold right out from under me. I was devastated. I had been working so hard for many years and it seemed like I was worse off financially than I was when I was in my early 20s. In my late 30s, I couldn't even afford a 10 year old car. Then just 4 months ago I started having yet another problem with my car and I new that I had to do something. I couldn't keep putting money into the car just to have it breakdown again in a few months. As I was driving one day I came across the kind of car that I had been wanting for 12 years now. I went to the dealership and learned that it was a complete rip off. It had high mileage and the dealer wanted too much for it. This prompted me to go online to see if there was another car out there that was similar but with better mileage and a better price. I stumbled across a car more than 250 miles away that was exactly what I had been wanting. It was old, but it had really low miles and the price was very reasonable. Again I did my research. I contacted my insurance company, applied for loans, and developed an annoying relationship with a guy at the dealership. The deal fell through at first because I couldn't get approved for a low interest loan. But I knew this car was meant for me. I waited a few days and called him back with plan. After about 30 minutes of negotiating we made a deal for a somewhat affordable down payment and a tiny bit off the total price of the car. He agreed to hold it for me until the next weekend.

I flew to the west coast for the funeral a few days later, it was very sad seeing her little body in the casket. The service was short, and nobody had too much to say, perhaps because her life had been so short. Later we went back to my cousin's place, and when some of the older family members left, we got pretty drunk. My cousin told me that losing her was the worst thing he'd ever experienced, that since I didn't have a child myself I couldn't understand, and I tend to agree with him. His wife came down and told him to stop drinking and come to bed, and I said goodnight to him.

The giraffes were running around playing with their young babies who looked as if they had just learned to walk. We were really lucky to see the penguins who were out swimming in the afternoon, but not for very long. It looked like they had gotten full from all of the fish they were being fed and went back into their private area to nap. I couldn't blame them for that!

Then in the lead up to this, he stopped eating or drinking, had trouble even walking, and had a dull glassy look in his eyes. I took him to the vet in a panic whereupon he informed me that Stubbs red blood cell count was dangerously low and his kidneys had degraded even further. After spending a week under observation there being given fluids and medicine I was allowed to take him home, under orders to inject a saline solution into him every day which he understandably was not overly happy about (and the scars from the scratches and bites on my arms can attest to that), but it seemed to be working for several months. Then he just abruptly degraded again do it was back to the vet, they did the usual treatment and observation before letting me bring him home, but this time was different and I think we all knew it, but no one wanted to say that I was just taking him home so he could die in a place of comfort rather than a cage surrounded by people he didn't know. He was fine for a short while upon coming home seeming to have one last gasp of energy where he was friendly and playful, but the other cats could sense something was off and kept their distance.  All too soon he found himself unable to even stand and was forced to drag himself around the room on his side, even picking him up caused him to yowl in pain. The end was upon us that night, there was a loud screech from him in the middle of the night and by the time I had gotten out of bed and over to him he was already dead.

We could have potentially gotten replacements, but the house was so old and run down that nobody seemed very interested. The landlord wasn't very responsive and to make things worse, some squatters had been nextdoor for several months already. At a certain point, I no longer had enough money for rent payments.

Thankfully, they trusted us as well, since we still didn't have the income to pay rent, but were looking for work. We started packing and got ready to leave that old house behind. I still hurt when I think about that old place; we had a big back yard with a beautiful garden and it was fairly peaceful until the squatters were there, but those times are lost to the past now. It took nearly a month to get everything out of there; we had made our lives there together for about 3 years and I had lived there for 6 years before; most of my adult life. Thankfully we were able to get help moving boxes. I don't know how we managed to get everything stored away here, but somehow my girlfriend found a way. She can do anything when she puts her mind to it. We've been here for 3 months now and it's starting to feel like home, but there's still things to get used to. We live with 2 other people and have to share a bathroom, which is pretty annoying, but I guess it's okay. It almost feels like I'm going through a haze, still, but we keep on going. My girlfriend has a job now and I'm bringing in small amounts, still. Sometimes it feels like we're struggling to make ends meet, but I guess that's life.", "label": "recalled", "group": "DXO157RB"}

The reason for the abortion was that I was going through an illness at the time and I would have needed some assistance, but was led to believe that no one would help me.  The night before the procedure I came home and told my mom what was going on.  I was crying, begging her to help me and I remember specifically stating that this was not something that I wanted to do and that I hated myself for doing so.  My mom told me that she was going to tell my father and, seeing as how he did not speak to me during that time, I was under the assumption that he knew and that was the reason that he chose not to speak to me. About 4 months ago, my sister disclosed that my mom did not tell my dad that I was pregnant as the time and instead phrased it as a question, asking what he would do if he found out that I was pregnant.  When he was asked this question my father stated that they would have no choice but to help me out.  This was never disclosed to me so I went ahead with the abortion, thinking that I had no one on my side.  To make matters even worse, my mom did not disclose my pregnancy to my father until 5 years after the fact.  I am now left carrying tremendous guilt and hatred for myself because of what I had done, and everything could have been avoided.  This revelation has opened up a new wound and I now feel as though I am dealing with this all over again.  I do not know what to say to my mom, let alone how to approach the topic altogether.  I now feel like a failure even more and I did not stand up for something that I loved dearly.  I want to talk to my mom about this but our family is in such discord now that I do not want to add any fuel to the fire.", "label": "recalled", "group": "JMSRG3J4"}

The baptism was not a hurried decision. I had been studying with Jehovah's Witnesses for more than two years before I decided that I wanted to get baptized. I had learned much about Jehovah, his word the Bible, and what it means to be a christian from Jehovah's Witnesses. When I decided to get baptized, the brother studying with me was very happy but I was happier. On the day of my baptism, I called all my friends to witness the event. My family also came to the Assembly hall. I must say that it was a very memorable day for me. I was very happy that day. I took lots of pictures and selfies so that the memory would remain with me for a very long time. That Saturday in April is one that I will never forget in a hurry.

Although he looked quite young, he claims he has been teaching math for 15 years. I have always been very good at math, so I was looking forward to learning a lot in this class. Of course the first few weeks easy because most of the material was review. However, Mr. Bolton insisted that everything been done exactly as he wanted it. For example, we had to right our name in the upper right hand corner of each assignment. If it was not written there he would take of points. In about the middle of October, when we started getting into the new material, things took a turn for the worse. Mr. Bolton insisted that the students were required to show the work for how we solved the problems. He would not except the fact that this is old fashioned way of doing things. Students today are have lived their entire lives in the digital age. When there is something to know, we use our cells phones to search for the answer. That's how we did the work, it can't be written down. If the answer is correct, that all you need. Well, Mr. Bolton kept taking off points for not showing the work, and by Thanksgiving, my average in the class was 47! Since I have always been an honor student, I know the problem was Mr. Bolton, not me. So I told Mom about it.

This was way outside of the normal legal process of eviction. We eventually had an altercation and I had to call the police on him.

It was freaking me out because not only had nothing like that ever happened to me before I also had never heard of anything like that happening to anyone else! I drove myself to the eye doctor unbelievably with my eye like that. The eye doctor sent me to a retina specialist. What happened 3 days later was that I had to get eye surgery because I had a hemorraged blood vessel in my eye. I remembered about 3 nights before that I had accidentally hit myself in the eye with my hand. It hurt for awhile but then I had forgotten all about it. After the surgery I still saw little blood vessel floaters for a couple of weeks but am happy to say my eye got back to normal.

I know it's selfish to feel this way, but it's not going to be all about me anymore.\" I was so scared that I even contemplated giving him up for an adoption early on in the pregnancy, but that all changed once I had my first ultrasound. Three months ago....one bright and early Thursday morning...I began to feel strong contractions and instantly knew Mateo was ready to make his entrance into this world. I quickly called out to my sister and told her it was time. The trip to the hospital was a blur, I kind of felt like I was in a trance...almost losing my grip on reality. I finally came to once I was on the hospital bed and getting ready to push. The pain was so intense and again the doubtful thoughts began to come to my mind, \"Are you really ready for this? Are you really ready to be a mother and handle all that comes with it?\" Before more questions could continue racing through my mind, my body instantly took over and I felt a sudden urge to push. I pushed and pushed for what seemed like an eternity and boy was it painful! I felt so tired and thought I couldn't push anymore until the nurse yelled out, \"Keep going! His head is right there!\" I pushed with the last bit of energy I had left in me and Mateo made his grand entrance.

He mentioned the friend in casual conversation after I had asked him several times to no longer talk about him. This caused a serious argument between us, during which he accused me of \"going off the deep end\". He used my mental health issues (anxiety and depression) as ammunition in this argument. His use of my mental health to support his position really hurt my feelings for several reasons. The most important of those reasons being that he and I had begun sharing our mental health issues with each other. Our issues had not been something we have been able to really discuss in the past. I thought we had reached a point where I would be able to share things with him and we could understand each other in that way. The \"friend\" in question never really did anything serious enough to me to warrant getting the law involved, but it had bothered me for several years. In years past, my father was aware of the issues and stopped being friends with the person in question. I am not sure why he suddenly decided that what the \"friend\" did wasn't an issue anymore. It really hurt my feelings that he seemed to have decided that my feelings were no longer important. He claimed I should get over it because it had been several years since the incidents happened. I tried to explain to him that I was mostly over the past incidents, but it was difficult to not think about him when the person in question was brought up on a regular basis. This didn't really seem to matter to him. Instead, he was more interested in doing whatever he could to not think about this problem. I am still not sure how our relationship will be fixed, even after all this time.", "label": "retold", "group": "EMC9B7ZH"}

The problem is that the schools are not 5 minutes away from each other; they are more like 15!  This is such a big day for both of them and I cannot wait to see them off to their first days of the rest of their lives. We are all very excited.  My wife and I had to come up with a plan to get each one to school on time, so they didn't feel out of place arriving late. Actually, we wanted them to arrive early to their classes.  So this was the plan. We would all wake up early in the morning and cook breakfast and have a family breakfast together.  It was decided that I would take the oldest son to his first day of kindergarten and see him off, and my wife would take the youngest to Pre-K. That way every one was on time and each child got the specialized attention they deserved. The plan was set, we explained to each of the boys what we were planning and they happily agreed. After breakfast, we each got to say our good byes to the boys and even the boys said goodbye to each other. It was rather emotional for everyone. We loaded our vehicles up and away we went.  As my oldest son and I arrived to the building, I could see the anticipation in his eyes.  He was very excited. As we entered the school, his excitement quickly turned to anxiety. He didn't want to go to the classroom.  I told him everything was going to be okay and I would see him after school.  I said \"Look at the friends you are going to make.\" After a few minutes, he calmed down and saw all the other children already playing with the toys.  Out of the window, he could see the playground.  He soon became fearless and very excited and went in to hang his backpack.  I stayed for a few short minutes so I could remember this day forever. It is and always will be a very special day in my heart.", "label": "imagined", "group": "WG5OKILZ"}

The damn cast was a menace to society! There have been tons of times when he's swung that thing around and nearly tripped me. It's also riddled with dirty drawings scribbled in marker and jokes poking fun at him falling off a cliff. I still can't believe he took that tumble, but Derek likes to act fearless. I also think he might have been a little drunk, but I could never really be sure. The strangest part is that it was a cliff that we've climbed a hundred times before. I have no idea how he slipped in a way that propelled him off the cliff face and onto the ground below. That's why I think he may have been drinking beforehand, it wouldn't be out of the realm of possibilities. When he hit the ground, we did chuckle a little bit. It didn't look like that bad of a fall and he landed on a soft part of the ground. Once he started moaning and whimpering, we knew it was pretty bad. We quickly ran down to check on him and his leg was bent up behind him in a very unnatural way. We had to call for an ambulance and they came into the park and took him out on a stretcher. That was almost two months ago and he's finally getting back to some normalcy. He hated having the cast at first but eventually it started to get him attention. Each time he told the story of how he fell, it got wilder and wilder. At one point I think he included something about a fight with a bear, but no one believed that version of the story. I'm happy that the fall didn't permanently injure him. I hope he learns to be more careful in the future.", "label": "imagined", "group": "QTON2DI6"}

I'm a disabled OIF/New Dawn army vets with major depression, anxiety disorder, PTSD, and minor agoraphobia, and my time has run out at the shelter, meaning the VA wouldn't pay for more than 2 years of staying there. I had been living in LA for the last 7 years, since I left fort hood Texas. I moved to LA to try and go to UCLA, but I didn't realize at the time just how bad my mental condition was, and it quickly became apparent. After about 4 years of on and off trying to go to classes, and my symptoms becoming more apparent and dictating my life's choices. For 3 weeks I stayed in a park, hiding as best I could, and coming to near starvation. I found out from another homeless vet that although there weren't any shelters or food cupboards I could go to without a referral near by to where I was, I could always travel the 25 miles to go to the VA where they would place me in housing of some kind. So I finally did, and they put me in a recovery program for the homeless, mentally ill, and drug addicted vets of LA.  It turned out I was much worse outside and it was apparent to others how much worse I was doing mentally, than I was aware of on the inside - and the VA very quickly approved not only the increase to my disability benefits, going from 50% service connected to 100%, and also paying for my shelter stay on a 3 month basis, with a second manager from the VA coming to check on progress and whether I needed the continued shelter. Of course, this was great news, but I was still new to medication and therapy, and I was in an extremely self destructive and self hating place. I wanted to kill myself, I thought about it daily, I didn't think there was any hope, so when the good news came in, it barely registered in my mind. Just like my physical shape \u2013 going from 220 pounds at 15% body fat to 400 pounds in under 3 years \u2013 I was nearly unaware of my circumstances changing. And the VA paid me 15000 dollars in back pay from when I submitted the increase in benefits. Looking back, I wish I has been ready to leave then. But I wasn't. And over that year, I ate nearly 30000 in fast food, almost never leaving my room, and eventually breaking my leg with how overweight I got. In May of this year my time ran out. I had been on medication for nearly 6 months, and it had started helping a ton. No more panic attacks when I didn't go outside. Very little suicidal thoughts on a day to day. And my new case manager had helped me come up with great coping mechanisms for when I left. And so I did. I left for Florida, where my son is, and I've been living here since. I've dropped 40 pounds, I go on walks daily, I'm eating less than 1500 calories a day, and swimming multiple times a week, and now even working online with amazon mturk.

I remember it being such a beautiful day. The sort of day where the sky is a brilliant blue and the sun is just shinning down and it feels like there's absolutely no way anything could possibly go wrong. Well, to my shock things did go quite wrong. As we drove through the swamp land, me being careful to stay on the well marked roads because I wanted to make sure to keep my daughter safe I found that the roads were actually torn apart. Since I hadn't realized this in a timely fashion I ended up flipping the car off of the side of the road into the mud. Thankfully both my daughter and I were both still awake after this and not hurt badly. But I realized that we were hopelessly stuck as the doors had been jammed shut and I felt something pressing against me so I couldn't really move my left arm at all. I called for emergency services and fortunately they arrived quite quickly and were able to easily and efficiently get both of us out of the car and transported to the hospital. At the hospital the on call doctor did a full workup of both of us to make sure there was no lasting damage. Fortunately the doctor was not able to find anything seriously wrong with either of us. When I think back to that day that is probably the one outcome that I'm most thankful for seeing how many different ways this could have wound up being so much worse. Once we were discharged from the hospital I did some research on the roads in that area since I had always known them to be safe and never troublesome I was quite upset about what happened. After some extensive research I learned that the company had been pumping the swamps the last few days but had neglected to put up any sort of caution signs or do the required testing. This lack of signage is what directly lead to our accident and did not allow road users to be properly aware of a very important ongoing situation. I immediately notified my state's authorities of the issues that were going on with the company in the hopes that they would be able to help prevent something similiar happening to someone else.

About eight months ago we had gotten together and in a family meeting. Things were said and emotions were shared. We discussed all things that mattered to us and got anything off our chests. Feeling were hurt and it got a bit sticky. Ultimately we all wanted a fresh start and agreed to spend some more time together. About 4 1/2 months ago we were planning to get together. We made plans for a day a month or so in advance. When the time got closer there it was brought to my attention that it was not only siblings, but our significant others. Which I prefer, but I did not have a reliable sitter that could spend the entire day with my kids. I told my oldest brother that we would have to alter the plans or not attend. He became upset and really tried to persuade me to go with the original plan. He wanted to meet up and then we could go home and the rest of them would go to dinner in town like he wanted. My sister agreed that was not a good idea. We tried to come up with some other plans, but they were never booked and then the reservations where unavailable. I gave up and decided it wasn't worth my energy and would just go along with what I could and for when we had the sitter available. A few days before the planned day, it was decided that we couldn't come to a decision and that we should just postpone. In typical fashion, we never got together. We got busy with life and the holidays. We got together for the holidays but not just to be social.

On the night of August 3rd, I packed my suitcases for my trip the following day - I was prepared get some peace by venturing back to my hometown: Detroit, Michigan. I woke up at 4:00 AM the following morning, ready to drive down to the airport. I wanted to get there early for my 7:00 AM flight so that I could get through security and have a cup of coffee before I had to jump onto my airplane. Upon my arrival, I did the usual: I checked in my luggage, went through the security checkpoints, and I still had an hour to kill before I had to hop on the plane. I went over to the cafeteria's Starbucks and ordered a tall latte - I was still tired after all, and moderately anxious for my upcoming flight. I sat down at a corner booth, drink in hand, and looked out at the airport's lobby. I saw so many people scattered about, many rushing to the gates so that they don't miss their flights. I knew that I was glad that I left early enough to relax while many others didn't. Enamored by these thoughts, I failed to recognize the gorgeous stranger who sat down at my booth, until I felt a whisper in my ear.\"I know who you are and what you've done,\" she said. Shocked, I could only muster, \"what could you possibly mean? I'm only here drinking my coffee before my flight home. I've not done anything wrong.\"Smugly, she said \"I never said that you did anything wrong. How presumptuous. My name is Ellie, and I know that you're a very prominent figure inside of a small circle within the automotive industry. You work on AI, and you have worked on inventing of the most promising safety mechanisms known to the world. I want to help you further your research, but I need you to do one thing for me first.\"Shocked by how well this woman knew me, I knew that she must have some insider information. She had an intimidating aura, but my intuition told me that I could trust her.\"What do you need?\" I asked, cautiously.\"You mustn't get on that plane - it's been rigged; it just so happens that you have a large bounty on your head. Your endeavors to benefit the world have not been well appreciated by all. Come with me - we have much to discuss,\" Ellie said. I'm glad that I trusted Ellie that day, for the plane exploded shortly after it got a few thousand feet into the air; it was all over the news for the following week. This beautiful, knowledgeable, mysterious woman saved my life - the least that I could do is listen to her, and, further more, I need to pay her back, and it looks like to do that, I need to further take her up on her offer so that I might hopefully clear this bounty that looms over my head.", "label": "imagined", "group": "827SABDD"}

You see, not too long ago we bought a puppy and he was very nice. However, the only thing he was scared of was the fact that there are things that look like cars. He doesn't know what they are, keep in mind he is still very young. But at the end of the day we pushed him to his limits so that he can overcome these things. After a while, the dog learned to not chase cars nor bite on their wheels. As a result, this meant that our dog is one dog that is not scared of anything in this life making him immune to the most compelling emotions of fear. As a result, this made me love the dog much more because that meant something. The more I think about it, the more my heart is filled with joy throughout the decades. I have never imagined that I would have a dog. And nevermind actually have a dog that lets me motivate him to do things that I never thought he could do. I guess that is another part of life that we must account for. Everything that is alive is capable of learning even rocks can do that too.

I was picked up by an old friend who escorted me to an island he's been living on called Chilo\u00e9. A two hour car-ride and some conversation and we'd crossed the ferry, seeing sea lions swimming alongside us as we walked off the boat. We drove to the hostel he and his girlfriend had opened, I'd be rooming there for three nights. Right away I felt the whole weight of the world taken off my shoulders. No internet, no cell phones, no hustle and bustle of city streets. Nature was everyplace and I was joined by two other travelers, my friend and his girlfriend as they cooked dinner for the group. We sat around a large table and shared a meal and some local beer and talked about our plans for the following days. On awakening at 6 AM I smelled a pot of coffee that was brewing from a kettle on the stove. We all shuffled to the kitchen still half-asleep. We had coffee and some toast and piled into a van that would take us on our very first Chilo\u00e9 adventure. We crossed the river in a boat manned by Octavio, a local craftsman and part-time tour fixer. When we arrived on the island I had no clue what to expect from our hike. The start of the path was filled with trees and I couldn't see far beyond them. We all got off the boat and began our trek together, a humble group of four. As we rounded a corner and climbed a small hill...the otherside was otherworldly. Green and lush plantlife framed the ocean with waves crashing up onto the sandy beaches, wild horses roaming around and the site of an old shipwreck washed to shore was visable. The sun was breaking through the clouds and it was perhaps the most incredible vista I've been privy to my whole life. The air was fresh and cool and we all stopped for a moment to really take it all in. The hike would continue along the beach and then into a forest preserve, mud, old outposts and finally back onto the beach as we awaited our dangerous trek through wasit-high waters that were a bit volatile to get to the portion of the island that housed a colony of penguins. I had to sign a waver and slowly traverse a half-raging sea but the end result was a dream come true. To walk among the penguins. No camera, no cell phone to capture the moment I was razor-focused on preserving it in my memory. That trip was one I will never, ever forget. The new friendships formed, the fresh seafood enjoyed from boats just back from sea, the guitar playing around the living quarters of the hostel, the local beer to be had and most importantly the nature of Chilo\u00e9 that brought me back from the insanity of city life...back to nature.", "label": "recalled", "group": "B2UXCTNS"}

While it was always something that I wanted to do, my family always came first and working to provide for my wife and kids was my priority. There was a national event coming up and while I planned on attending it, it was only as a spectator. My family apparently had different plans as they worked out a plan with some friends of mine. Their plan was for me to actually drive a car at the track and race. They worked out their plan to perfection as I had no idea what they had planned. As it turned out, I was really surprised that they  had figured out a way for it to happen. I didn't have a car to run but they had figured out a way for me to have one to enter. I ran the qualifying passes and it felt great to be back on the race track. Yes, I was a bit rusty behind the wheel of a drag car, but it sure felt great.  My family said that I was grinning from ear to ear when I climbed out of the race car after my first pass. When the 1st round came up, my nerves were a little wound up as I had a ton of different emotions going through my system. I was nervous and excited at the same time. While in the staging lanes, my family was all around the car and we were just saying how fun it was to be at the track and that there was no pressure. It was time for the race rounds to begin so I got into the car, buckled in, and put my helmet on. I waited for my chance to run and got the car pre-staged. The lights came down and I had a really sharp reaction time. The other racer had a great reaction as well. When we got to the finish line, he was slightly ahead and I lost the race. Even though I didn't win any races, it was great to have the chance again to see if I could still do it, and I could.

It happened at a local university library where I read some  very interesting books and fables and books on mistakes and books on business and books on marketing. One day, I decided to take a break from reading business books and instead picked up a book on ancient Persian fables. That is folk tales passed orally down through generations, and then written down by the author. The book was published by the United Nations, it could have been published by UNESCO. Anyway, I picked up the book and started reading. It had some of the most sage advise I could have ever imagined inside of it. I was homeless at the time, so it really helped me set myself straight, and get through. I read one story about a queen who revealed her prince's secret, that he was in fact a prince at night but during the day he had to be ugly and fat, and a serpent if I remember correctly. He came from the Kingdom of Darkness, where everything is black. When the princess revealed this secret, at the behest of her evil aunt, her husband could not re-form into his day form, and had to go back to the Kingdom of Darkness. The princess wore down seven iron rods, and seven pairs of iron shoes, before she could return to the kingdom of darkness. It just goes to show, true love conquers all. In another story, there is a very small girl, perhaps 5 or 6 inches tall, who helps her father, who is very poor. She also stops some robbers from stealing from a rich household. The moral of the story is, no matter how small you are, you can always be of use. But perhaps the most memorable story is, when a man has to go on a cycle to get one end, and the quote goes, even if what you want is in the mouth of a lion, you must go and get it out.", "label": "recalled", "group": "NJJW1FUL"}

We then ate some food and drank some drank and it got us talking about communicating a little more with each other.

The second job represented the next step toward my career goals and a realization of a lot of the time and resources I've put toward advancing my career.  However, the salary was not commensurate with the amount of work I was doing, I was putting in nearly 90 hours a week, and the situation was incredibly stressful.  It started to take a toll on my physical and emotional health and strained my relationships with family, friends, and coworkers.  The dual-role situation was expected to last one year, at which point my second job would be split off into its own role, which I would fill.  However, an the organization faced some unexpected financial hardship, which meant they had to reduce positions, rather than create new one.  This meant they asked me to continue in the dual role for another year, promising to split the roles in another year's time, when finances were better.  After a long and careful consideration, I determined to decline and take a position with another organization which would be a lateral move.  I applied for and was offered the new job, which I accepted.  After already initiating the onboard process with the new organization, my old organization called and begged me to come back.  They offered a slightly different arrangement of my role.  However, it would still require significant time (and likely stress) for the same amount of pay and no guarantee of the company's future stability.  It put me back in the throes of decision making.  Ultimately, I turned them down again but I did have some feelings of melancholy.  Fortunately, the latest update of this story takes a turn for the happy.  I have been recruited by a third organization to fulfill a newly created role in my desired field.  I've had a hand in defining the role, bargaining for my pay, and shaping the next steps of my career.  This divine turn of events shows that sometimes, in order to make progress, we first have to take a step back.", "label": "retold", "group": "XK2E4Q9S"}

Once we were in the Spanish airport, about 10 minutes before our gate was going to be announced, we received an email saying that our flight was cancelled. We didn't know it at the moment, but the gate we needed to go to in Paris was having some kind of unknown issue and a few flights were cancelled. Nobody at the airline seemed to know what was going on, and after hours of waiting in lines, talking to airline employees and pulling our hair out, we were herded onto a bus that was headed to Barcelona. It was about an 8 hour bus ride. We arrived at the Barcelona airport around midnight, but our bus driver had never been told what to do with us once we got there. We did about 5 laps around the airport while the driver waited for an answer from somebody, anybody. He eventually dropped us off at a terminal, drove off and left us there. Once again, no one at the airport knew what was going on and it took hours to get everything situated. We ended up sleeping on the floor of the airport, behind a customer service booth. We only got an hour of sleep before airport security woke us up and told us to move.

The reason for this being we would like to come up with a bigger down payment so our monthly mortgage is less. Also, we are working to rebuild credit for a tough situation we got into a few years ago. I'm not sure what the market looks like for renting homes right now but I'm hopeful we can find something quick. We are so fortunate that the buyer of our home is giving us ample time to move out.

I've already told you about all the fun we had, how amazing the Falls themselves were, but I haven't told you about my own personal fall.  I guess I've been looking over my shoulder, still nervous that they might change their mind and come after me and lock me up.  It's just not like me to get in trouble with the law. The Falls were good, the shopping was good, but something happened when we went out to eat that first night.  Maybe it was the excitement of seeing the Falls, the rush of all that water, the exciting splash of water on my arms, making the hair stand on end.  The gentle kiss of the wet breeze on my face.  We decided to spend a little more than usual on dinner and go someplace fancy. It wasn't just fancy, it was elegant, refined.  It was the most romantic dinner we'd been to since our honeymoon.  We started with a glass of champaign, split a bottle of red wine during the meal, and then got lured by the waiter into trying something afterwards, a nice Canadian port he recommended. It was amazing.  Like velvet on our tongues.  I've never been really, really drunk before like that.  We stumbled back to our room and had an amazing night.  Something really came alive in my husband, and in me.  It was my first time with a hangover, but it was a night of many firsts, for both of us. We loaded up with several bottles of that port before heading home again.  I'm always nervous crossing the border, thinking about how hard it was for grandma.  Maybe part of me feels like there's always a chance they may change their mind about us, see the mistake they made with her, and keep us all out forever.  My heart was pounding when they pulled us over for inspection, and stopped dead when they found the port.  It was too much! I've never been so ashamed.

I was so touched, and my husband just had the cutest smile on his face. I didn't want to say anything, but I know that the tickets must have been pretty expensive and it would have taken him a long time to save up for them. I just think it's one of the sweetest things he has ever done for me. The next night we went out for dinner before catching the show and the whole thing was just a dream. We had so much fun and I felt ten years younger! We danced and sang along together, and when we went home we both couldn't stop talking about how great the show had been. I don't think I will ever forget this birthday, it was such a delight.", "label": "imagined", "group": "4E2KIOFL"}

Looking back, I wonder how I could have made it.  One time I finished a 60 page report that was due the next day. After taking a break before I was to proofread it, I went to my computer only to find my report gone!  I was frantically trying to find it over and over.  I called my parents to tell them what happened. They tried to console me. I felt better after the phone call and, after about an hour of feeling sorry for myself, I decided I better get to work rewriting the whole paper.  I was up all night rewriting it, but I did it.  I think the second time around was much better and I ended up getting an A. That was only one of many times when I felt like I couldn't take any more.  Another time I was doing a lab report.  I had been working the whole semester on a lab project.  Every day I collected data for the report.  Near the end of the semester I went to the lab to work on my project and wrap it up.  When I got there, somebody had broken in to the lab and completely ruined my project along with several other people's. Half the class was distraught over that incident and complained to each other. Fortunately our professor was kind enough to accept our unfinished data and notes.  We all received an A for our projects.  These are just two of the many obstacles I had to overcome.

I don't get to supervise and I don't get to tell people what to do yet. Normally when it's time for promotions to her my job creates projects Which are meant to test all of the skills that we have learned throughout our work. Mind You i work as a graphic arts and designer So you never completely learn everything there is to know about the job. In this particular project we were being tested on how to make 3-D animation's like anime come to life and make a short trailer for an upcoming show that we really liked. The price for the person who improves the nurse was a supervisor position. Needless to say I was ecstatic we had exactly one month to prepare the trailer and present it to the company. Need list to say there were some people that didn't believe that I could actually do it even though I had one previous project promotion. Even though there was a lot of people putting me down I worked and Leslie and tired Leslie until my trailer was perfect and there was not a single flaw.  Some people didn't start working on the project till two weeks prior but I didn't waste any time and started the day that the project was given. Even so I didn't think that the mass was long enough for us to completely perfect this trailer but I did the best I could. When the time came for me to present my project people were snickering and laughing and honestly thought that I didn't have anything good. I honestly can't believe that people like this exist in such a professional workplace it blows my mind. That's besides the point, so then when I presented my trailer I saw everyone's charge dropped including the big bosses. Needless to say I won the promotion of supervisor and honestly couldn't be more elated and excited. The moral of this is that no matter how big or small your dream is or whatever you put your mind to you can do anything you wish.

Let me tell you it was hopping, and everybody was cheering and hollering, but most importantly making some serious dough. I see a spot open up, so I belly up to the table and place a pass line bet, and wait for the shooter to throw. The shooter, a black gentleman who looks like he's knows a little about throwing dice, grabs the shiny red cubes and tosses them a couple of times against the sidewall, then arranges them meticulously before snatching them up and tossing them high into the air. They land at the other side of the table, bounce once and careen off the backwall, then land softly; the stickman has a look. \"Seven, front line winner, pay the line!\", he calls out. The stickman slides the dice back to the shooter, where he again arranges and then tosses them expertly. \"Yoooooo eleven! Pay the line!\" calls the dealer as the players pick thier winnings up off the table. Well wouldn't you believe it, this shooter would go on to hit five straight points, earning me a cool thousand dollars in the process!

She immediately captured them, and we began the process of researching and determining how to socialize them. This was not easy, but it was easier than the marketing and adoption! As my sister began to work with the babies to help them be more comfortable with her, I began looking for TNR programs for the parents, and low cost vet care for the whole crew. Luckily, we were able to find the vet care at a very reasonable price and all the babies as well as their feral parents were taken care of. This was no small feat, as going to our vet would have cost probably about 2,100 dollars for the seven cats.  Then came adoption time. I began researching this and acting on it early. We did adoption photo shoots for some adorable baby photos. Thsi was no easy task, sine the babies were still partially feral, and my sister's home is very dark. (So we could not move them to light or bring in lighting). With the adorable pictures in hand, my son, my sister and I began writing biographies. We designed fliers, made and Instagram, made a Twitter. I made an adoption application and set it up so it would be easy for my sister to weed through the results and find good families. We reached out to everyone we knew. We marketed, we shared, we posted to craigslist. This final step was our fatal error. The terrible pet owners who came out of the woodwork on craigslist hurt our hearts and paralyzed us. Finally, I reached out to a woman I met the previous year (ironically enough, when I bought some ice skates from her on craigslist) who used to run a kitten rescue. She arranged for two of the kittens to be adopted out through the rescue. This was the best choice since the rescue in question vetted heavily, more heavily than we as individuals could.  The babies found a home - together - after attending their first adoption event. It was heartbreaking to \"give up\" and not be responsible for finding their homes, but it was the best we could do. We were not emotionally prepared for vetting the adopters.", "label": "retold", "group": "4FAZ7RJE"}

The humidity, our two-year-old son and one-year-old Jack Russell Terrier had long begun to wear on her two-weeks-overdue body. To our delight, that crescendo of fatigue, discomfort and anticipation was short lived. Baby Abigail, \"Abbie\" (or as we call her \"Abbie P\" - the P is for \"peanut\") was born In early September, just in time to cut short our Labor Day picnic. Abbie's brother, Sam, fell in love with his baby sister from the moment he laid eyes on her. I would hold her down where he could go nose to nose with her but not get too rough. Sometimes when Pam was breastfeeding, Sam would give them both a knowing grin, as it was in the not too far distant past that he enjoyed such nutritive and bonding moments with his mom. Vivian the Jack Russell went bonkers when she saw the new addition to her little people posse. More than once we found her resting her head on Abbie's carrier, gazing at her as she slept, with a longing look for the day that Abbie would be able to scoot around like Sam. Pam and I are, needless to say, overjoyed. We wanted one of each, a family of four. In fact, the day we met in Westerly 5 years ago, we talked about how many children each of us would like to have and our answers matched. Funny for a first encounter, perhaps, but the beach was warm, the drinks were colorful and tequila-heavy, and our mutual group of friends decided love and marriage would be the topic on such a sultry day.

I knew how to bike quite well but I hadn't gone on any serious mountain bike trails yet. I remember when we arrived at the trail, he told me to follow him and that he would go slow. I was surprised how much stamina and focus it took to go down these trails right away but I kept up with my son at first. After a few minutes of going down the trail, however, my memory of the event gets hazy. What I do remember is that the trail started to feature these large jumps, and my son would back flip off every single one. So I figured since he's doing so many back flips, I would be able to do at least one pretty easily. The last I remember is getting so much air off the jump that I was headed straight into a river next to the trail. After that I don't remember anything until I woke up in the hospital, but my son tells me I performed a triple back flip off the biggest jump and landed straight in the river, and that he was able to get me out. But when he did, I apparently wasn't breathing, and thankfully he was CPR certified and was successful. Since then my memory has been pretty bad, I think I hit my head on a rock even though I was wearing a helmet. Since then I have been pretty terrified of biking at all.

I don't know how it started but he's taken to batting them around the hard wood floors of mine and my husband's home. He plays with the gum balls (Archie, not my husband) for a week or two, before I throw them out and replace with a new one. I find it wasteful, but whatever, it's his only vice. Both my husband and I find it funny, like we do with everything our animals do. We often bond over our love for them and our shared love of stand up, food, wildlife rehabilitation, coffee and Elvis. We also bond over similar emotional health hurdles that we've dealt with throughout our lives. My husband and I have a host of separate issues resulting from bad childhood trauma on both ends. We've done a lot of reflection and are pretty careful to navigate our problems with respect and compassion for each other. That's not to say we haven't had our fair share of problems though. We've dealt with insecurity, snide remarks, jealousy, trust issues etc. Recently, we were really going through it when I found out he hid something from me that he found embarrassing. It make me question his honesty and ability to communicate with me. I was so upset and felt like a lot of what we had worked on in our relationship was moot. We were both sitting on our bed, my cheeks tear-stained after a long, long talk about the issue. It was pretty silent when we heard a gumball roll across the floor in the adjacent room. My husband and I said, in perfect unison: \"Get that gum ball, Archie.\" It was like we'd rehearsed it...This random, bizarre phrase that nobody else has probably ever said. I let out a choked half laugh/half cry and my husband did too. It's really strange. Therapy and self-help books and talking out everything has helped our marriage a lot. It's given us tools to work through bad habits taught to us by our parents and we've managed to navigate through a lot of the toxic muck that often destroys relationships. But sometimes, I think we need the reminder that our lives are really great even with the hard moments and what we've built with our love and our home and our effort and our animals, is something that I'd never trade in a million years.

I was hoping you would reassure me that I wouldn't be. Instead, you took my silence as an affirmation that I would be better off. You went to work and I went on with my day as normal. Little did I know that everything had changed. Days later, I tried to reconnect and work on the relationship, but you were no longer interested. It hurt me tremendously. I was counting on you for years, and despite all our problems, I was still trying to fix things. Used to our fights, I expected things to fall back into place in the next few weeks, since we could never stay away from each other for too long. That never happened. I reluctantly began going on dates with other people to try to move on and heal from your rejection, and you took that as a sign that I was seeking something or something else. I didn't know what else to do to try to fix something you didn't want anymore. Months later, we remain separated and rarely talk. It's still unbelievable to me because I never imagined we could go longer than a day without taking to each other. I have yet to tell my parents that it ended. I think that's because part of me is still holding on to hope that we'll work out. However, I'm simultaneously starting to accept that things are this way. Even though I still miss you, I no longer have the desire to tell you about everything that happens in my life. I no longer have the urge to talk to you all the time or think about you constantly. It's unfamiliar, but I guess this is what you wanted. I don't know the details of your life anymore and that's ok. In the end, I just hope we're both happy wherever we end up.

I had stopped at the gas station to buy us something to drink as well as snacks, and had just pulled out of the gas station. We got about five minutes down the road when we hit back to back traffic. I was looking down at my phone trying to change the song, and had not been paying attention to the fact that the car in front of me had stopped because of the traffic. I rear ended them and tried to  quickly put my foot on the breaks, but due to the impact I ended up hitting them a second time. The impact also caused them to hit the car in front of them. We pulled over to the side of the road, where I saw that although the front end of my car was completely messed up and pushed in, both of the other cars were fine, and only had a few noticeable scratches, if that. My car was not safe to drive due to fluids leaking out of the engine, and the tow truck that took my car said my car was basically totaled, and it would most likely be too costly if I were to try to get the car fixed, since I would already have to pay a bit of money for them towing the car and taking it to the auto shop that towed it. I ended up just paying them and letting them keep the car at their junkyard. Due to my car being totaled I have been out of a car for the past few months, and although I am now working from home at the moment, I was unable to do the job I had originally been working doing, as I used my car travelling to different stores doing audits. I am still without a car at the moment due to the accident. The job I am working now has just started so I do hope I am able to buy a new car at the end of the month. Due to this accident I have had issues with getting basic things done like grocery shopping and running errands. I have been either dependent on family members or on Lyft or Uber to get around, which is a bit of an inconvenience at times. I cannot just go where I want exactly when I need to, and it also costs quite a bit of money getting around if I use Lyft or Uber, which has become very expensive.", "label": "retold", "group": "9W72FH3Y"}

A short time ago though I realized that this was not the life for me. Of course I realized this too late. I already have a wife, kids, house and lots of college debt. I now spend my days working to pay interest to the same people who probably made up the story on how to be happy. So, in need of some relief, I traveled to south Florida to see an old friend. We talked - for hours - about the true meaning of life, its purpose, and what to do when you are unhappy. Some people say that if you are not happy in life, change it. Find another job. Move. However, if you are already in the society trap of the American Dream, escape is not so easy. Well, at least not if you have a conscious. There is a scene in the movie \"Office Space\" that really strikes home. In a moment of clarity, Peter, the main character, tell his psychologist that each day he wakes up is the worst day of his life. I feel him. My memorable event was not something that happened \"to me,\" but an awakening inside me.

I remember going to work that day from camp, putting him on his lead so he could hang out outside, enjoying the sunshine on my walk.  I took lunch early that day for some reason, and when I got back home he was still outside.  As I approached he seemed fine (if a little quiet), but when I made it to him...His right eye was swollen shut and was tender to the touch.  He would barely let me look at at it, which is especially odd for him.  He kept scratching it with his paw as though there was an itch he just couldn't get to, and the swelling was spreading a bit down his face and snout.  He was obviously in pain, and I had no idea what or how or when; all I knew was that my boyfriend, whose dog he is, was out for the next 3 days on a wilderness excursion with no contact and suddenly I was in charge. The next two days were awful.  He got Benedryl at first, but when that didn't do anything the vet came out to see him.  Somehow, he had managed to poke a hole in his cornea and if things went wrong he would go blind in that eye.  When I heard that, I didn't know what to do-- how do I break that to my partner?!  How did he manage to poke a hole in his cornea while by himself?!  It's not like that's something that 'just accidentally' happens all the time. He ended up in a cone for weeks, and had to take multiple medications-- one of which had to go in his swollen-shut eye.  He wasn't allowed to be outside alone anymore and had to go to a friend's house every day before work.  Because of his injury and the resulting cone, he was lethargic and not eating very much, which was compounded by the fact that my partner was still not home or able to be contacted. It ultimately worked out, and the dog did not lose his eye.  My partner came home and I saw him run through every emotion I had had for the last few days in minutes as I brought him up to speed.

So, I go up to, who I thought was the prettiest woman in the group, and just started talking to her, or at least I tried to.

But something surprising happen that I didn't expect at all. The women who I was talking to clearly knew I was a wreck, but it didn't annoy her or piss her off. It seems that she picked up on the situation and started to lead the conversation instead. After she started stalking to me and calmed me down, our talk was rather pleasant. In fact, she said she found my nervousness with her rather cute. If I'd gone up to her all macho, she said she would have shut me down harshly in front of everyone. That I was 'real' with her and not trying to fake a persona was something she respected. After about another 15 minutes of talking, she thanked me about my honesty and she actually did give me her number.

And after she went to practice and worked hard for two hours, she came home and suffered a massive heart attack. She literally blew out the bottom of her heart. After several days her eyes opened and I asked the neurologist if she was waking up.

Around Christmas time I started to really notice how many people were struggling around me. I knew it happened, but somehow I never really thought too much about it. About 2 weeks ago now, I was walking down the road on my way to get a cup of coffee before doing some Christmas shopping and I saw a bunch of businesses with people curled up outside them. Trying to keep themselves warm with blankets, sleeping bags and hats. Those were the lucky ones. I saw ones that were just huddled up inside doorways doing their best to stay warm and alive with empty cups in front of them, or signs. Just begging people to help them out with the basic needs that every human being needs and deserves. I don't know what it was that made me notice today of all days. Maybe because I was out spending too much money on Christmas presents that really weren't that needed when there are people who can't even afford a hot meal. I spotted one guy sitting there with just a small blanket, though he wasn't using the blanket, the blanket was curled around a small dog, who looked as though he had seen better days. I dug into my pockets and checked what I had for cash, and it wasn't much. I stopped to talk to him, and learned he had been laid off 2 years ago and lost his home and has no family near by. I talked to him for a bit learning that he found the dog abandoned one day and decided to keep him. His money that he gets from panhandling goes to feeding his dog, who is his best friend. I asked him if he was hungry and he looked at me quite surprised and said he was starving, he was lucky to eat at all each day. He asked a friend of his a few feet away to watch his dog, and off we went to get some lunch. I picked up some sandwiches for the others that I spotted and some hot cups of coffee, and of course a bag of dog food for his buddy. We delivered the food, and I've never seen such joy before.

My little cousin wasn't sure which toy to pick, but I told her that it couldn't be more than 20 dollars. However, she insisted that she wanted this miniature action figure that was well beyond the price range we had agreed on. When I firmly told her no, she began throwing the biggest tantrum I had ever witnessed. She was crying her lungs out, and no matter what I did, there was no quieting her. Given that I detest when children do this, I forcefully grabbed her by her wrists and got her out of the store empty handed. Not only did she not get the toy she wanted, but I told her that she could forget about getting anything else. She looked at me with eyes of rage, and just stopped talking to me for a few days after that. My aunt wasn't particularly happy with the situation but she took my side that it was the best thing that I could've done. That doesn't mean that I felt happy by the outcome, but I think teaching kids at early age that throwing fits like those are not going to solve problems. A few days before her birthday, I went and had a serious talk with her explaining how what she did was wrong. She eventually apologized, and told her that if she still wanted a toy. She ended up just going for ice cream, saying that she didn't want anything else. Fortunately, her birthday was a success, and seemed quite happy for having all her family and friends with her. I did ended up buying her that toy that she wanted because I think she showed maturity when she apologized for what she did, and wanted to reward her for that.", "label": "recalled", "group": "2LIAQ4DU"}

It was a nice ceremony for her and her high school sweetheart, and I'm glad I was able to clear my schedule to attend. I missed her older sister's wedding which by design was essentially the same ceremony, staged in the same location and using the same exact decor and themes. As such, I felt I very much needed to make sure I at least attended one of the two. It was nice to see all my family members and I grew a little closer to a few of them. As one of the older cousins, I was proud to see how much my younger cousins have grown into young adulthood. They're certainly hitting typical life milestones faster than I am, though that's not a notable point of insecurity for me. What really struck me most profoundly is the sense of loneliness and deep-seated personal insistence on sadness I feel at events like this. They're obviously supposed to joyous occasions but I have a really difficult time experiencing those feelings in such a setting. Perhaps it's because the last family wedding I attended was my sister's back in 2012, a time when both my parents were still alive. The feelings of sadness I get at events like this can be best described almost as if I'm mourning the fact that this type of event is in my past and has passed me by. That because my parents are no longer around I'm always destined to have a radically different experience should I ever have a full on wedding celebration, that events like these, as typical and average as they may be, are completely out of reach for me. I was struck by a certain moment, when my uncle co-opted a wedding practice my dad and my sister pioneered at least in the context of our family; the montage dance sequence. It was a bit upsetting to see someone else do the thing that serves as a very unique and fond memory for me and my sister.

He was loud and probably drunk. This brought back some memories for me that I would rather not think about. There was always someone grabbing me when I was young and I had to get away from them.

Well, turns out (after several rounds of all those \"useless\" tests), they found a blood clot! So the good news and the bad news. They can't operate (well, I guess that is both good and bad, since surgery is not on my bucket list!.) They can treat it with medicine (ugh, but I should be, and kind of am, grateful for that.) But the real killer (bad choice of words!) is that I have had to make some dramatic changes in my life style. That's good and bad too I suppose. I needed to make some changes anyway, as I know since retiring I have been way too sedentary. But the tricky part is: I need to walk daily, but not too much. And, I can sit and stand, but not for long periods of time. (Guess I will scratch off my bucket list flying to Australia...or any flights longer than 2 hours.) On the one hand, I am so grateful that this is treatable, and honestly, probably NOT what I will end up dying from. On the other hand, it is one more thing that I have to think about... a lot.

I was quite saddened by this event. However, during the funeral, I felt funny.  Everyone around me mourned for the death of a sixteen year old boy while I stood in the background. I was quite emotionless, and stood like a statue. How does this relate to me being a class clown and outgoing personality? Well, I'll tell you. After the funeral, family and friend attended his wake. While there I was able to catch up with old friends that I hadn't seen in years. Everyone tried to keep a smile on their face but the death of a fallen comrade watched over us like a stormy cloud sucking all the happiness and life out of the room. This is when my personality seemed to kick in to second gear. Sadness? Not if l could help it. Before I knew what was happening, I was buzzing all over the banquet room telling jokes here and there. Talking to family members of my dead friend as if we had known each other for years when in actuality the death of their brother, nephew, or cousin was what brought us together in the first place. I tried my best to make everyone forget what had actually happened. Hours later, walking home in a 3 piece suit. Jacket hung over my shoulder like I was a tough guy from the 20's, I smiled.

Then we went to the insect section of the zoo. There were so many of them like spiders, scorpions, also bigger animals like cobras, rattlesnakes stuff like that. Then we saw the elephants. It was pretty interesting because they were in an area that looked like a jungle and off in the distance we heard gorillas grunting. So we walked around until we found the gorillas and around there we also saw other kinds of primates like chimpanzees. We walked around a bit more and we stumbled upon all the other African animals like tigers, lions, giraffes etc. It was actually pretty cool to see the giraffes because one of them got really close to me. Along the way we saw a lot of different kinds of birds and small animals. We passed by the koalas and other Australian animals like Tasmanian devils, and kangaroos. I would have enjoyed it more though if we had gone on another day. It was really hot that day and we didn't really prepare for it.

It was memorable and something that I think about often, especially when I go into any other caves and desire to explore passages that are a little tight. Getting stuck in a cave, even thought it was only for about 30 minutes was somewhat terrifying when I think of it. Though I tried to keep my cool and I knew that I would be rescued since there was a large group of people with me, it still makes me think twice every time I see a tight spot in any cave.  With that being said, it began like any other caving trip in Florida, going through various squeezes and crawls into new areas that I have never been before. I followed my friends all the way to the furthest back room that I could reach; they could all fit through without much trouble, and I only had to exhale a little bit to fit through. The back room was interesting, don\u2019t get me wrong, but it was not worth what came next. I tried to fit back through the small opening that I came in through, but going headfirst at such an angle was not going to be the easiest. Seeing another route out that everyone else was going through made me also think that I could just crawl headfirst through that short passage. While I could get my chest and upper body through with no problem, that is where I ran into the problem. My hips just would not fit through! I called to the guys that were with me, who thought I was just joking and soon realized I was not. They pulled my arms to help and I was stuck in tight! They were making slow progress, but it was steady progress. Inch by inch I was able to wiggle my hips while they pulled my arms till finally I got out! It seemed like 30 minutes total, but it was probably much less in real time.

The cancer was in an area that could not be operated on so her only options were chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Since she already suffers from Fibromyalgia we knew it was going to be very hard on her. On the first day of radiation the doctor decided to wait a few days to start the chemo treatment as both in one day would be too much for her. When the day came we went to the infusion center and she was hooked up for about 4 hours but had to take a chemo bag with her that pumped the chemicals into her body 24 hours per day. She started on a Monday and by Wednesday she was so sick she couldn't get out of bed. As the day progressed she started getting confused and couldn't even finish a sentence. I decided she had to go to the hospital and I thought I could help her out of bed and downstairs and into the car but I found that she was in so much pain I couldn't touch her anywhere without her screaming. I called 911 for an ambulance and while waiting for them her condition worsened. They arrived in about 10 minutes and I tried to move as many things out of the way as I could so they could get the gurney down our two half flights of stairs. There were 4 of them and it took all of us to get her on the gurney, because she was screaming in pain and delirious. I was trying to stay calm but this all happened so suddenly I completely forgot about our little girl. I had block her off in the den while the paramedics were there as that was the first thing they requested so no animals would be in the way or get hurt. Once they had her in the ambulance they asked where I wanted her to be taken and if I needed to ride in the front of the ambulance. There said insurance restrictions prevented me from riding in the back with her. I said I would follow them in my car, not knowing how long I would be there. As they drove away I thought of all the things I had to do while at the same time thinking and worrying about my wife. A neighbor who I did not know and who lives 2 doors away was standing outside watching. For a brief second I was a bit annoyed at them watching a \"show\" and I was becoming a bir frantic trying to figure out everything I had to do even before getting in my car and driving to the hospital so I could be with my sweetheart. I heard this soft voice saying \"sir\", \"sir\" and I turned around to see this neighbor trying to get my attention. I thought she might want to know what was going on but she softly said \"if there's anything I can do for you let me know\".

However, finances were the primary decision maker or what would force my hand.  This university was almost $50,000 a year.  I had received a lot of aid, but not quite enough to be able to attend.  I requested more aid but was basically side-walled by their financial aid officer who insisted their offer was already beyond what they normally do.  I thought for giggles I would submit a similar request to the other universities I had applied to as I realized that I would have to go elsewhere.  One school, which I had ruled out as being too expensive came back with an amazing offer, they recognized my immense need and gave me even more money.   This was even weirder considering that the second university was actually significantly more selective.  All in all, it would be much cheaper with the out of pocket being less than 10% of the other college I had so dearly wanted to attend.  I realized from this experience that the other school who responded to my plea cared more about me than the school that did not answer my plea.  For that reason, I decided that while the second school was not (in my opinion) as great a fit, I would go there, as they believed in me and wanted to help me.

The internship would allow me to apply what I'd learned in my classes while getting real life experience and guidance from an experienced teacher. The only downside to this was that the internship was unpaid, so I had to leave my job for 3 months. I'd known about this for a while, so I planned ahead and had money set aside to get me through until I graduated. Unfortunately, once I started my internship, life decided to intervene. It seemed like every week there was a new emergency that required me to dip into my savings, and by week 6, I was totally broke. I ran the numbers and realized that if I'd stayed in my internship and finished it, I would be so behind on rent and car payments that I would probably have lost both. Being a husband and a father, I wasn't willing to risk that, so I quit my internship and went back to work. Doing this forced me to change my major and lose about a year of credits in the process.

I took a free kick and the defense of the opposing team cleared it back towards our goal. I turned to chase the ball when I heard a pop and it felt like someone had kicked my heel. I fell to the ground immediately and the ref, who had been standing next to me, blew his whistle to stop the game. I looked around perplexed because no one was next to me, so I could not have been kicked. I was not in any pain, but my right ankle was unable to support me. The ref alerted my team that I would need help, he seemed more aware of what was going on than I did at the time. I said I was fine and crawled off the field. When I did, I started to realize something was pretty seriously wrong. I still was not in any pain, but I had broke out into a cold sweat and was feeling nauseous. My body had gone into shock. It seemed I had ruptured my Achilles tendon. I would not know this for sure until two days later when I finally relented and visited the doctor. I'm still amazed at how little pain I had and can only attribute it to going into shock right away. I also was given a pain reliever and ice almost immediately. Four days after the event I would have my first surgery. And for the past several months, I have been trying to recover from the injury.", "label": "recalled", "group": "FDIR5T5H"}

She was born with Spina Bifida, therefore she's had bladder and bowel issues since birth. She had a bladder rupture that resulted in her stomach filling up with urine. It's terribly painful and life threatening so when we got to the emergency room they immediately prepped her for surgery. This isn't the first time it's happened, it's the third. Her urologist told me that when a patient has that many ruptures, the bladder is no good and they'll have to install an ileochimney. An ileochimney is a stoma created where they pull out part of the bladder and she will have to wear a bag on the outside of her bladder to catch the urine coming out. One good thing about it is that she won't have to catheterize anymore, so that's a bright point. I always cry when she gets sick but this time I really wailed, because I hate seeing her going through pain and knowing it might not be the last time. We were in the hospital for two weeks, and I was there for her every step of the way. Thankfully I have a great support system, so my 7 year old son was taken care of. My daughter is 11, has seen more pain and difficulty than most adults, and is the sweetest person in the world. I do everything I can to protect her and make her happy.

Though i didn't intend on doing this trip by myself that is what happened do to my friend being hurt and unable to go. I set off on the upper part of the river knowing it could be dangerous. i had never been on this part of the river and the water was very low but i was determined to do what id considered the beginning to the end. I was very nervous about this as i found low water to be more dangerous than normal float levels. The first 15 miles or so i was very careful not to run through anything i deemed to dangerous. I met several very nice people along the way and actually camped overnite with people twice in the 5 nights i was on the river. This is a trip i will never forget as i had nearly perfect weather for the time i was on the river. Unfortunately after the 6th day i had to abandon my trip as we had a flooding rain coming in that night and it wasn't worth the risk to try and ride it out until water levels dropped to decent floating conditions. To this day it still bothers me i wasn't able to complete the trip and i will try again this year i hope.

I returned Betty to her pen after the walk, then went to ask what else I could do. I was given the task of washing up the linens, beddings and toys in the laundry room. After that, I did the dog and cat dishes (yes, they have cats, too.) I was there only four hours, but it  felt longer because this is, after all, Florida, and boy is it hot!

I didn't want to bring up his mortality as I imagined he would have wanted to talk about other things, so I did my best to get to know the man, his passions, his regrets, his proudest moments. I had gotten back to the hotel where I stayed when I got the call that he had passed away. I didn't feel much emotion at the time because I had expected it. Then came another call, a frantic one.\"Where's Dad?\" Did they lose the body? Before I could respond, \"Oh I was at the wrong room.\" My brother had been drinking. The funeral had been set for last week, open casket. But furiously, they had a problem with the embalming, so closed casket it was going to be.

Lo and behold, within a couple of weeks, I received an invitation for an on-site interview. The on-site interview was quite difficult. It lasted for a day, and I met with several people at the company, going from one office to the other without any breaks in between. At the end of the day, I was exhausted, but I knew that I did well. The manager then invited me to his office for a wrap-up, and during this conversation he told me about the great benefits in the company and how well they pay compared to others in the field. At this point I felt like they were going to offer me the job, as the way he talked to me felt like they were trying to persuade me the job before even a formal offer was extended. I left the city and came back home, wondering when the offer would come. I received an email within two weeks. It started with \"I'm very sorry to inform you that...\" Oh well... I know another perfect job is waiting for me out there, but I was devastated.", "label": "recalled", "group": "GHBT8C0K"}

I had gotten home and discovered him laying on his side in pain in the middle of the night.  I felt his bladder and realized that it was a hard as a rock.  I immediately put him in a carrier and brought him to the emergency medical center for pets.  The vet there had a urinary catheter placed but not without complications.  His urethral passage was no narrow that she was struggling to place the catheter.  Without the urinary catheter, my cat was going to need a surgery I knew I wouldn't be able to afford.  I was so heartbroken and scared that I was going to have to euthanize my cat.  Thankfully, the vet was able to place the urinary catheter and flushed out his bladder.  I felt so relieved that he was going to be able to make it through the night.  It gave me the time needed to be able to contact our regular vet in the morning and to be able to transfer him there.  I spent all night thinking about my cat and hoping that he would be okay.  Once I did transfer him to the regular vet, she recommended that he have surgery to widen his urethral passage.  This would help prevent future blockages that he would like have.  Thankfully, surgery at our regular vet is much cheaper than surgery at the medical emergency center.  Therefore, I was able to provide him the preventive surgery.  After that surgery was done, I felt so much better.  All he had to do was recover from the surgery and I was grateful that he was going to live.  This experience has made me more aware of how both my cats are doing in terms of their health.  I think about this event a few times of month because I know that cats who have been blocked before can get blocked again.  It makes me feel cautious and truly appreciate having my cat with me today.", "label": "retold", "group": "VPDXMQZA"}

I made sure to stay close by to my older brother, because he isn't married yet and I knew he felt lonely. I also grabbed some cake balls, because yum. When the actual dancing started \u2014 like, with everyone \u2014 I joined the people on the floor and had a blast. I'm not the best dancer, but I can follow along and can keep rhythm. I remember seeing my brother and how happy he was, and how pretty his bride looked. Even once the dancing started, though, I remember that i was a host and tried to keep an eye on people. I noticed one person in particular who looked lonely, and normally she really likes dancing. Not wanting the day to go badly for her, I left the dance floor and went to talk to her. I discovered she was sad because her own husband couldn't make it, so I said I would dance with her. That made her really happy, and she went back out on to the floor. Once I was satisfied she was okay, I found a couple other people to partner up and dance. I remember feeling so content and like I was serving an important purpose. I'm not normally very extroverted, but I felt like it was my responsibility, you know? We ended the night by having all the groomsmen grabbing my brother and hoisting him over their heads, then throwing him up in the air to crowd surf. He was a little terrified, but he also had fun, so it was an absolute win. I'm so glad everyone had a good time.", "label": "recalled", "group": "83R3F66J"}

The place doesn't take reservations; you leave your name up front with someone at the shiny silver old cash register and wait in the crowded bar.   You know your table is ready when they shout out your name.   It was a busy Monday night with the usual forty-minute wait.  A middle-aged couple noticed one of my tables being reset, so the husband walked up to manager Dan and asked, \u201cCan we sit there?\u201d   He looked at the long list of names to see who was up next and replied, \"You can if you're Tippen.\"  The guy said, \"Great!\" and handed him a folded dollar bill as Dan escorted them to their table. A couple of minutes later, Dan ran up to me and said, \"Don't talk to the couple on table 54!\"   I'd never been instructed to ignore a party in the four years I'd worked here\u2014not that there hadn't been a few difficult customers who found their way into the place.  Some had gotten over-lubricated at the bar after the long wait for a table, others demanded culinary preparations that were beyond the scope of the kitchen: \"No sir, we don't have baked salmon wrapped in a pastry shell with a lobster buerre blanc sauce, although that certainly sounds like a wonderful preparation.  While it is true, as you've so astutely pointed out, that we do have an oven, salmon, water, butter, flour, rolling pin, lobster, and shallots, I'm afraid the chef won't find that argument sufficiently compelling to persuade him to just drop everything while the other 100-plus seated customers and fifty more waiting just stand and suck it up for another hour.\"I looked over at the couple.  The man's blue jeans and weathered skin suggested agricultural or construction work.  His wife's turquoise sweatshirt with SAN FRANCISCO emblazoned in glitter across the front suggested a visit to Fisherman's Wharf and maybe some clam chowder in hollowed-out sourdough for lunch.  These were not your typical problem customers. Now Dan\u2019s back at the table and the discussion does not look cordial: \"\u2026and that's not the way we do things around here.\"  He handed the dollar bill back to the man and walked away.    The befuddled couple looked like they had just stepped into the Twilight Zone. Finally, I went up to Dan to find out what was going on.   He explained, \"I sat those two on your table and the guy handed me a buck. When I went back up front, this other guy comes up to me and says \u2018Hey, they just walked in the door and you seated those two ahead of us; we've been waiting here for over half an hour!'

Since my first writing, not much has changed between my mother and myself. We are definitely not as close as we were before any of this, and there has been no real attempt by either of us to repair our relationship. Again, to reiterate points I made in my first writing, my uncle is very important to me. He played a major role in my upbringing, was a massive influence in my life, and a very positive influence to that matter. Thankfully, I have been able to visit him a few times since the last writing, and have been in contact with him via text messaging quite a bit.  Unfortunately, in the last few weeks he has taken a turn for the worse, and is now back in the hospital again after being released for a short period of time. Two days ago we found out that his platelet count has dropped very low after receiving chemo treatment, which he never really wanted to have done in the first place. He says he has made his peace, and whatever happens is whats going to happen, and doesn't think it is worth it to keep racking up such high medical bills when there is no chance the chemo will be able to save his life. I am having a hard time with this, and am finding it very difficult to accept. I know that this how things go when someone is diagnosed with something such as this. But the man is like a father to me, and I'm not really sure where I am at emotionally at the moment. Thankfully I have a good support system in place with my wife, and friends, and they are really helping to keep the negative emotions at bay.  At this point, the doctors have no real expectations of how long he'll survive, as every time something positive happens, it seems like something equally as negative happens. But just like I said in my last entry, I am going to keep doing my best to stay positive, and keep hoping for the best. Maybe in the coming weeks my mother, and will begin to repair our relationship, and maybe not. But, things are what they are now, and there are far more important things on my mind than the way she chose to handle this situation.", "label": "retold", "group": "OHDDX8YY"}

I will admit that I don't go to visit her nearly as much as I should in the nursing home but to be honest it really just breaks my heart to do so. She seems so miserable and she looks so unhealthy. She's lost so much weight and her hair has gotten so white and thin. It's hard to look at this sickly and frail old woman and try to equate her with the strong and sweet woman that I grew up with. Living over an hour away most of our conversations have had to be over the phone and maybe that's just better for us both. Sometimes when I do visit she cries a lot and I feel so awful because there's nothing I can do to alleviate her sadness and pain. I was working from home today and my mom called to tell me that she was visiting Nana and that Nana wanted to talk to me. I've always been a really literal person so I pay a lot of attention not only to what people say but how they say it. She didn't say that she wanted me to talk to Nana, but that Nana wanted to talk to me. Which meant that she asked my mom to contact me. I know this might not seem like a big deal to most people, but it really was a huge deal to me because Nana has had a series of strokes over the past few years and her speech never truly recovered from the last one. Communicating is extremely frustrating for her as well as us. So that means that she was able to communicate well enough that my mother was able to understand what she wanted her to do. So, I told my mom to go ahead and put her on the phone. As soon as I heard her voice filter through the headset, I greeted her warmly and asked if the hospital staff was treating her well. She started trying to say something and was stammering really badly. Knowing that this is the point in which she usually gets frustrated and gives up, I encouraged her to think very carefully about what she wanted to say and try again. We went through that for several minutes before she could finally get out the words that \"She had me on her mind and she just wanted to tell me that she loved me.\" The rest of our conversation was pretty much me guessing what she was trying to convey and her either confirming or denying that my guess was right.

Prior to that, the owner of the company I worked for had made the decision to shut down the business where I had worked at for about five years.  As it was a family run small business where I was the only employee, I was not offered any kind of severance benefits. I was only informed that they would give me a month's notice before they closed down the business. As it was, I was unemployed for a good six months. It was unfortunate that during this time my husband hurt himself while working his restaurant job. He had to have a hernia surgery and had to recover for a good two weeks.  During this time he was not allowed any physical activity and could not work. At this time, I was collecting unemployment benefits, our only source of income, which did not remotely cover our monthly expenses and rent.  We had virtually no savings, and had mounting debt.  My husband and I both grew depressed and started to get into arguments over the smallest things, like the fact that his smoking habit was making a dent in my meager unemployment benefits, or my not wanting to get out of bed and look for employment because I was depressed.  However, as my unemployment benefit was set to run out, I had no choice but to go out and look for employment, even if it paid minimum wage and inconvenient hours.  I was scouring employment websites and Craigslist for hours every day looking for jobs that I had no interest in just so that I could put food on the table.  I was discouraged because I did not get any calls, emails or applications returned while I was coming closer and closer to maxing out my unemployment benefits. It was not look good for us.  Finally though, I managed to get a part-time job as a receptionist for a debt collector, a job which I hated and lasted at for three weeks before I managed to interview for a logistics job which I got and have stayed at to this day.", "label": "retold", "group": "IU0AZQZ3"}

I remember when he was a baby and he told me how much he loved life where we were and how he never wanted to leave. I wish I did not lie to myself all these years and think him honest in that situation. James has been my only child for these long years and I have cared for him as best as I could. I have worked several jobs to make ends meet and allow him a childhood that was stress free. In fact, he believed us wealthy because of the gentle disguise I held over his eyes. I do hope that he will be happy wherever he ends up. I know not what Florida will bring to him, but it will be an adventure for him nonetheless. I know I sound like I am rambling, but I just do not know how to get my feelings straight about James and my mind is going very fast at the thought of not seeing him for a long while. I take refuge in the thought that I will indeed see him again at Christmas. He has made a promise to return and James always keeps his promises, no matter how small. I always knew he would leave me and move on to his own life, but I did not want it to be true and I thought maybe just not thinking about it would make it go away. That is not right it appears. My thoughts have been on my husband of late as well. I wonder where he has gotten to on the other side. I lost him several years ago when James was a small boy and now I think of him everyday as well. Who would have thought that several years ago I would lose my husband to a disease and now I am losing my son to a move. One of them is one that I know I have to do, but if you would have told me years ago what would happen in my life, I would not believe it. The only person I will have left with James gone is not a person at all. My cat will have to be the replacement for James and those are hard shoes to fill. I am talking too much about myself here.

In most cultures, birthdays are celebrated in some of the same ways. Often, birthdays are celebrated with a gift, party, or some other special act. main event this Falling in love with the person that is your perfect fit is one of the best feelings in the world. Although it's not uncommon to find yourself falling in love (or simply, lust) with the wrong person before getting to Mr. Right, when you finally meet the guy for you, you'll realize it was worth the wait. Everything you thought you knew about love and relationships will suddenly be turned on its head. And it's not just love you'll feel - you'll go through a whole host of other positive emotions. Here are some of the things you can expect to feel when you start falling for the right someone. When I met my husband, the primary emotion I remember feeling was shock. It sounds nuts, but I truly couldn't believe he even existed. I had spent so much time before not even sure if I wanted to be in a relationship. I didn't really believe that true love was real, and I definitely didn't think I'd ever feel so strongly about someone that I wanted to be with forever. Falling in love with the right person will leave you feeling surprised, like you didn't see it coming. You'll marvel at the fact that someone so perfect for you even exists - let alone loves as much as they do, too. In prior relationships, I would purposely not express how I was feeling most of the time, for fear of being judged or ridiculed. It could be the biggest thing, like disappointment over a friend moving, to the smallest, like moodiness from PMS. It didn't matter - if it was a real feeling, I kept it to myself. With my husband, however, I want to do the exact opposite: share everything with him. When you're with the right someone, you'll know because you'll feel safer than you ever have in the past. In relationships before my husband, I knew what it was like to feel momentarily excited (or even happy) for a little bit.", "label": "recalled", "group": "HR4ZDK8R"}

After she learned how to go under, she then started doing crazy things, like jumping under, and trying to do somersaults, and back flips under water. This took a week for her to do those, but still, it made me very proud of her. We still have some summer left, and all during summer she's had fun. Also, those few weeks ago, I got her a giant unicorn for her to float on that she used a lot when she went into the pool. She climbs up it and jumps into the pool like a diving board.

I ran from the building to my car, focusing on getting to the vehicle without getting my laptop wet and not really taking notice of the torrents of water pooling throughout the parking lot. I did notice that my shoes and clothes were soaked once I had reached the car. So, I drove from the lot and headed to my home that's just several miles away. I recall now driving through standing water on the road and shrugging it off as drainage issues. When I was close to home, I knew by this time that this rain was different. It was raining hard and not letting up. I couldn't see very well through the rain falling on the windshield. I contemplated pulling over but I was already so close to home. As I prepared to drive over a little bridge overpass, I felt my car being rocked a little. The car struggled for traction and I found myself being pulled off of the road by the rain runoff. I did the only thing I could think of, I exited my car and held onto a nearby tree. I watched as my vehicle and all my possessions inside it were swept over the bridge into the creek bed below. I waited in stunned silence until another driver spotted me and I climbed into their vehicle. I still can't believe this happened to me. I just feel lucky to be alive after something like that happening. I now am much more careful about driving in the rain and warn others to do the same.", "label": "imagined", "group": "B0K1FPQA"}

The time for my graduate studies finals was fast approaching and I had been wracking my brain over all of the content that I had to master within the next two weeks. The stress was growing more and more overwhelming with each passing hour. It eventually got to the point where I started facing a bout of insomnia. No matter what I tried, I could not bring myself to fall asleep. This grew more problematic after several days of being unable to drift of into sleep. I was having difficulty commuting to class and paying attention to what the professors were saying. After several days, I began to find it difficult to distinguish between what was reality and what was illusion; a common symptom of insomnia. The most unsettling perception I encountered was a group of children unknown to me. They were playing together in a field within a park. As they ran around, they began to extend their hands toward a nearby playground. I could see some kind energy emanating from their fingers. Almost instantly after this began, the metal implements on the playground began to move on their own. Some tore out of the ground and began to whirl around in mid air. The children were creating their own magnetic waves and were thus able to manipulate metal around them. It reminded me of the character Magneto from the X-Men comics, though the children did not appear to have any malevolent intent. When I finally snapped out of this vision, I was honestly uncertain about whether or not what I had seen was real. Sleep deprivation had obviously gotten the better of me. It wasn't until my finals were over that I was finally able to get some sleep. Having had time to rest and put finals behind me, the perceptions from this experience have begun to coalesce in my consciousness and I find myself needing to figure out what the experience meant.", "label": "imagined", "group": "5MDLGOBW"}

The play was fast and furious and very quickly a fight started. I had to remove Kate from the game because she was the one who started the fight with a player from Ohio State. The referee also confirmed that Kate started it. Later, I had also talked to Ohio State's captain (Brenda) about the fight after she had talked to her player (Ann) who was the victim of the fight. I couldn't believe it but Kate actually was pissed about it when I confronted her after the game and claimed I didn't believe her. This isn't like Kate, but I know she just broke up with her boyfriend and has been argumentative with most of us so I've basically written it off as a one-shot problem with her. In the last six months, she's finally been her normal self with everyone including me. Anyway, a couple of my teammates and I were at a party and a video of that particular game was being played and I watched that fight again. I'm very frustrated at myself. I had them run the video several times at a very slow rate and I finally saw what Kate had originally told me. It was Ann who started the fight very subtly and unnoticeable but definitely showed running the video slowly. The referee, Ohio State's captain and I were all wrong and Ann, the player had lied.

I thought it as a duck at first, so I didn't pay much attention, except that maybe I would move it after unloading my groceries so that it didn't get run over by someone else parking at the store. I put all my stuff in the back of my trunk and got in my car. All of sudden, I remembered about the baby duck, turned the car off, and got out to go move it to a spot farther away in the parking lot, closer to the canal on the west side of the grocery store. I was shocked it see it was not a duck, but rather, a baby kitten covered in ants! I grabbed a Gatorade bottle that I had just bought and in a panic dumped it on top of the kitten to wash off some of the ants. The kitten didn't have his eyes open and was crying loudly at this point. A person in the parking lot saw what was going on and ran over with some paper towels that were in her car. Neither of us could find a mom cat or any other kittens. I held the baby close and kept picking off ants. They weren't biting me, so at least I knew they weren't fire ants, but there were thousands of them crawling over my arms and stomach, as well as on the baby kitten. I decided the only thing I could do was wrap the kitten in an extra shirt in my car, put it on my lap and bring it home. I have bottle feeding experience and knew I needed to feed him right away. Shelters will euthanize a kitten that cannot feed itself. Asking for help from a rescue group in my area is pointless. I knew no one else would help this kitten, so I did the right thing and brought him to my house. I was afraid to bathe him at such a young age, but I had to get the rest of the ants and Gatorade off of him if he was going tot have a chance at survival.

These tasks can be walking, running, backing up, or turning the horse. Whenever a rider is showing their horse, the stay on the opposite side of the judge, so they are not in the way. Roping is when you have the rider behind a locked gate. A person at another gate releases an animal, usually a calf. The rider rides in to throw a rope around the calf's neck. If the rider is successful, they are timed. The times are ranked. The person with the best time wins that round. Next, Reigning is when a rider comes in riding their horse. The horse and rider are challenged with several different tasks, many which consist of spinning. Spinning is making tight circles while going as fast as the rider can.

His mother didn't want to have surgery, and said that if it was her time to go, it was her time to go.

To make a long story short, she still went in for the surgery at the end of August, but when they put the scope in for the stents, they found that there was no blockage as described - and that she didn't need to have the surgery. The doctor was astounded at how different the truth was from what was shown on the initial testing. This impacted me again because it meant that we'd been worrying for months about nothing. It made me realize that getting a second opinion is always necessary, because sometimes even medical professionals can make mistakes - that result in unnecessary worries for people for months, as well as end of life planning that doesn't need to be done. It made me scared, it made me sad, and it made me mad. I we were preparing for the worst for nearly 3 months, and it turned out that none of it was necessary.

As I was pulling a twenty dollar bill out, I began to hear arguing, and yelling next to me.  I looked up and out my passenger window and noticed an older man and a younger man screaming at one another.  Both men were very aggressive, and I was a little nervous by the scene.  I sat frozen in my seat, watching the confrontation.  Suddenly, the older man went to his car and opened the driver door and reached inside.  As I watched, he pulled a can of mace out of the car and proceeded to spray the other man in the face with it.  To my left side, a person came out of the door of the gas station.  This person was apparently unaware of the altercation, and was the next person to be maced by the angry older man.  I was stunned, and still safe inside my car when I saw a few people run to the older man, get sprayed and attempt to take the mace from him.  Once I saw the mace was out of the older mans hands, I got out of my car to help the gentleman that was maced leaving the store to turn the hose water on to rinse his hands and face.  Someone had already called the police and at this point they were pulling onto the gas station.  The older man was arrested, I was asked to give a statement, as were the other witnesses.  I was so happy that I didn't get out in the middle of that situation, or get maced.", "label": "recalled", "group": "IIAFU8BN"}

It's been two months since we opened our business in this wonderful location, and everything is going wonderfully.  But I have to keep reminding myself that it could have turned out very differently.  Every time I start to remember the horrible weeks leading up to the grand opening, I have an almost irresistible urge to go find Douglas (the hubby and other half of the business) and give him a big hug and a smacking big kiss for being such a rock through it all.  First, 4 weeks before the date, the landlord contacted us to say he thought there might be an unforeseen termite problem with the property.  Then a week later, no termites, just water damage, but might need to postpone tenancy.  Great, since our current lease at the time was due to expire and we had to get our stock and everything out of the store.  Then our movers went out of business.  Next, our suppliers  contacted us to say they were having problems with labor and shipping, and could we wait eight weeks for delivery.  The answer to that was a definite no, and I went power shopping to find new suppliers and fallback shipping.  Before I got new suppliers lined up I was tempted to just chuck it all in.  But Douglas got our friends to pitch in, we found an alternate location, new movers,new suppliers, an army of friends to help, and it actually happened.    The opening went off without a hitch, business is booming.  Life is good.  Out of disaster came the best business move we ever made.

I have planted many flowers, repainted it myself and reroofed a formerly run-down rental. The new neighbors put up a religious sign, from the local hate church. You know, the kind of church that goes to gay pride with signs that say, 'god hates fags,' or picket planned parenthood with fetus photos and angry shouting. The new neighbors' son also practice with weapons on the lawn with his buddies, some kind of asian battle sticks, numchucks, that kind of thing. It's a bunch of white men in their early 20's dressed in black almost every evening, using weapons. I am lesbian and not the only gay on the street. I felt more than a little threatened. Some neighbors stopped by to check in with me and let me know I could come by if I felt unsafe.  Two houses left phone numbers. After the new folks put up their sign from the hate church, new signs started popping up all over the neighborhood. It is a sign based on a US flag with lines of colored print. One line says, 'all are welcome here.' Another line says, \"diversity makes us strong. ' Another says, 'black lives matter.' Basically liberal, loving and inclusive statements and rally cries as befits most residents in this liberal university town. I felt very supported,  as an individual,  as a member of the neighborhood and as a member of a group often targeted for the way we were born.  When the church sign went up, I wasn't sure my neighbors would know the type of church it is- a divisive church, a judgemental church. But they did know, and responded. Now the new neighbors have taken down their sign. But the diversity signs have remained and multiplied.

My wife, 2 daughters and I traveled from coastal San Diego to the Palomar Mountain area where we camped outdoors for several nights in April of 2019.  While it was Spring time, the elevation of the campsite atop the mountain made for a very cold camping experience.  We arrived on the first afternoon to the campsite.  We were one of a total of 4 families camping at a campsite that could accommodate 50 campers, so that should have been our first clue that we might have picked a bad time to go camping.  We were very organized in that all of our camping gear was packed  well in our car such that we were easily able to extract things like the tent first.  After we had the tent erected, we placed the air mattresses inside of it and prepared the sleeping bags, and organized our clothing.  Once all of that was set-up, I decided to take a nap in the car (since I was still fighting off a lingering head cold) so my wife took our daughters to go for a short hike.  About at hour later my wife returned and we began to make preparations for dinner by setting up the fire.  While I had no experience camping, by wife had a reasonable amount of experience, so she was able to get the fire going without too much difficulty.  However, as we were warming dinner and the sun began to set, the temperature began to plummet.  My daughters and I began throwing on more and more layers of clothing in order to keep ourselves warm.  My wife, who was hovering over the fire while tending to the food, was not overly cold but she was stunned at how chilly it was getting so quickly.  I sat by the fire, eagerly awaiting dinner, with my two daughters crammed onto my lap as I sat in one of our folding camping chairs.  We ate dinner and the girls happily made smoores afterwards, but that didn't last long as the temperatures dipped into the 30's!  We put out the fire and retired to our tent in order to get some sleep.  We rearranged all of the sleeping bags and air mattresses so that we had 2 people in each one: myself and my smallest daughter in one, and my wife and older daughter in the other.  I was wearing 3 sweatshirts and had 2 extra blankets over me, but that was just barely enough to keep me from shivering all night long.  When the sun arose, we quickly started another fire, but quickly ran through the remainder of our firewood just to keep from shivering constantly all morning long.  After the sun was fully up, we were able to hike and bird watch, then enjoy a filling lunch.  However, as the sun began to drop in the sky the second day, the temperatures plunged too much.  We opted to take down the tent, re-pack the car, and head home so that we wouldn't have to endure another frigid (by San Diego standards) night on the mountain.  In spite of the cold, this was a fun first camping adventure with my wife and kids and I look forwards to doing it again.", "label": "recalled", "group": "RCZ9EZ43"}

To start with my relaxing morning I drew a bath with a bath bomb I'd been saving for such an occasion. The water was nice, warm and smelled delightful. I soaked for about 30 minutes. After my bath I looked around the house and realized it was a mess. To put my mind at ease I start tiding up and deep clean a good portion of my apartment. Now that my home looked as good as I felt, I began to get dressed to go to eat. I had given Mel a call to meet me there and she agreed. Feeling good and looked even better I grabbed my keys and went off. I finally get to the restaurant and I sit there wait for Mel to arrive. She texted me and said that she was gonna be a little late due to an accident on the freeway. I go ahead and order some coffee and a pastry while I wait. To get myself ahead in work for the following week, I respond and plan with client's requests and answer any questions they might have.

He looks at me and asks if I wanted to go out sometime. I tell him no. He makes another attempt and again I reject him. He gets frustrated and completely goes off. He goes on and calls me a bitch making a scene in the whole restaurant. He starts using racial slurs and tells me that I'm not pretty enough for him because of it.

It was strenuous and tiring, all for a job that is supposed to be relatively simple. My trainers were not trained in the subject matter themselves and have never worked in this position. Because of that, they had a hard time going over the subject matter with us as a class and it was painful to witness them struggle. I regret the entire experience, as I was offered a better position some weeks later with a better pay amount and less stressful training. It took SO LONG to complete, every training class was 3 hours long and we did several classes a day. The organizers were incompetent, and this was a mistake by far. I learned my lesson and so far I am much happier in my new position. I have made many friends and feel competent in the training I have received thus far.

My parents had arrived from overseas a few days prior, and my uncle and cousin drove from the country next-door to be with me. I was excited, more than I was trying to admit, or show. I don't like showing emotions, but sometimes my face betrays me.  I may have been the last one in the house to wake up, despite it being my graduation day. I could hear people going up and down the stairs getting ready. My boyfriend calls me and tells me he's on his way to pick me up and take me to the commencement ceremony, so I get up and start to get ready. I cannot decide what shoes to wear, so I go for my favorite pair that are light pink with flowers and wear a white dress. At this moment my boyfriend has arrived and is in the living room with my two uncles and my dad. It was his first time meeting my dad and the oldest uncle, which was to be honest kind of awkward for all of them. I put on the graduation gown, the cap and tassel on my hand and go downstairs and signal my boyfriend and cousin that we are ready to go. Before, I make sure to leave the ceremony tickets to my uncle to make sure that they have the ability to come there with no issues. We drive to my school, and I talk on the phone with my other friends who tell me that they are in the gown room, in line. I notify my boyfriend and cousin who were in line to go inside the audience, and I head out to the gown room. I find my name-card, my friends and I put on my cap and tassel and the time comes where we walk outside in rows and head for our seats in the podium. I remember thinking \"wow, this place is huge!\". I try to locate my cousin and boyfriend in the podium, which I succeed, after I call him on the phone. The ceremony starts, there are a lot of students graduating, and because our college was the last one, we had to wait for hours until it was our turn. However, now it feels as if it went pretty fast. Finally, our time to shine was almost there and our row gets up and starts heading to the podium. I could feel my legs shaking, and it was moving very fast. One by one the students were walking across, and it was finally me - I hand out my name-card to the caller, who surprisingly gets my name right, and I start heading towards the dean of my college and the president of the school, who shake my hand, congratulate me and hand me my diploma folder while taking a picture. I start heading out of the podium and I see my parents and uncles cheering me on, and I am so happy. The mos chilling moment that I had, was during the closing remarks, when the president guided us into turning the tassel from the left to the right side, to symbolize the end of an era of bachelors- I did and I still get the good chills.

He pretends to be a cat, he plays with his cats, he runs around meowing and grooming himself, basically anything a child can do to emulate a cat, he does.  For the last year he has had two cats and always talked about wanting more, always asking if we could get another, pointing out how he would be able to care for another anytime the opportunity arose.  I, as his mom, had said no to any more cats numerous times.  I was dead set against getting anymore, two was enough to feed and care for and buy litter for them to use.  Near my son's seventh birthday his father, my exhusband, called me up and asked if I was interested in a free cat.  My immediate response was no, I was not interested in having another cat in the house.  Then my ex said the cat was going to be a ragdoll, and my immediate no became an enthusiastic yes.  I had previously been interested in getting a rag doll kitty, I knew they were prized for the soft coats and gentle temperaments, and I knew they were sold for thousands of dollars.  Hearing that I could get one for free was amazing and I was not going to miss out on the chance to own a ragdoll.  She came home to us the weekend before his birthday and the humans here loved her immediately.  The other two cats took a little while to warm up to her, but they did.  Now it's commonplace to find them snuggled up to each other sleeping, or darting around playing together like furry little streaks of thunderous kitty running rampage. The cost of caring for three cats is somehow exponentially more than only two, but I wouldn't trade my new kitty for any amount of money in the world.  In this short time she has became a family member and you cannot put a price on your family members.", "label": "retold", "group": "LXD7AUP5"}

I looked him over a bit and found something wrong with his eyes. Actually I should say his eye - he only has one good eye, having lost the other one in a fight with another neighborhood cat. I looked and found a cloudy red spot on his good eye which looked like the storm on the surface of Jupiter. I took him to the vet to see what was going on, and the vet determined it was most likely ocular cancer. My cat doesn't seem to be in any obvious pain, but he is getting about much more carefully and not with the confidence he used to have. But, he does seem to be enjoying himself and not having a rough life, despite the clumsiness and reduced vision. With that said, the cancer is likely to spread, which leaves me with a difficult decision to make. Do I have the remaining good eye removed, thus making my cat blind, or do I take a wait and see approach and see if the cancer does indeed spread, possibly risking my cat's life? It seems that no matter what decision I make it will negatively affect my cat's quality of life. He's about 13 years old and not really a youngster, but he probably still has a few good years left in him if the cancer doesn't spread into other parts of his body. I'm not sure how good those years will be, though, if he's blind. He likes being outside a lot and kind of comes and goes as he pleases, and I fear blinding him will take that away from him. I live near a pretty busy road and I think he could get hit by a car if his vision is impaired. As of now, I've not made any decisions one way or the other. The cat is sticking around the house a bit more than usual, so my fears of removing his good eye may be unfounded - he may have figured out on his own that home is a safe place for him to be. He's always been a clever animal though, so this doesn't surprise me.

I had two enormous suitcases and my carry-on backpack. Unfortunately, for me, I woke up late on the day of my flight. My flight was scheduled to leave at 6 am. I woke up at four-thirty and raced to the airport. Nonetheless, it was too late. I was stranded. I had already spent most of my money on rent and food during the internship. I didn't have a credit card, only a debit card with a purchase limit of $100 and $40 in cash. This was not enough to pay a new flight back to New York. I was sure that I was going to have to spend the night at the airport until I could get a hold of my parents. I told my story to a West Jet agent, I'll call Mike. Mike was a godsend. He spoke to his supervisor and pulled some strings to get me on the next flight back to NYC. I only paid $50 for the extremely discounted ticket. I was so happy and grateful.

This vacation had been planned since the month they had gotten back from the vacation the year before. She was to spend a week out out of town with the kids visiting family. I had mentioned cooking bbq to send with her this year. I love bbq. Throughout the year I will have a few big cookouts, have people over to eat and have drinks and will generally share with neighbors as well. So the day before she left, I woke up at 4am and fired up our big offset cooker (the smoker) and prepped roughly 30 lbs of meat. I threw the meat on and tended to the fire all day all while she ran around took care of any last minute errands she needed to take care of before leaving. The meat hit its plateau, one of the longest I had experienced in my roughly 20 years of cooking bbq. Stressed because even when these were finished we still had work to do. At around 10pm they finished, we pulled them and let them rest. We then quickly shredded, and vacuum sealed all the meat for her trip. She leaves on her trip. We talk occasionally but no mention of the bbq. Day 2 passes, still haven't heard anything about the barbecue I sent. I just assumed it would be a few people and a maybe a small dinner get together and they would probably enjoy it. On day three I received some pictures of some tables and a tent setup with my bbq on display. They had invited everybody. At this point I am concerned. Is this type of bbq everyone's cup of tea? Apparently so, as I received a picture of groups of people eating and having a good time. My wife called and said it was a huge success, some even had as many three to four pulled pork sandwiches, she explained that people who didn't even plan on coming showed up to eat after they heard about the bbq.

We asked the kids what they would think about taking a trip down to Myrtle Beach and needless to say they were ecstatic. We hadn't had time to go on any type of vacation since my husband and I work fulltime jobs trying to pay off our mortgage. Well, we decided to go on a Friday morning so we took that Friday off of work. We headed down and it took us about 2 hours by car. The car ride there was actually pretty relaxing to say the least. The kids were busy on their iPads and I just enjoyed the scenery while my husband drove. When we got there, we checked into the hotel and the check in was seamless. We were pretty hungry after settling into the room so we decided to eat at the restaurant inside the hotel. The restaurant was busy but this didn't take away from our experience. The food was delicious. I decided on a fettuccine Alfredo, my husband a steak and the kids a burger each. After, the kids got ready to go into the pool for a bit before sundown. My husband had a few beers while I just had a margarita and the kids had so much fun at the pool. The next day, we decided to go to the beach. We bought sand toys for the boys and some snacks and a few umbrellas to fully enjoy the beach, and we did.", "label": "imagined", "group": "9WFE273K"}

It was my first time going, but my wife and kids had gone before when my mother in law was not sick.  When we got to the spot, a large cliff overlooking the area, we took a few minutes to look around and enjoy the scenery.  Then we found a small juniper tree that sat near the edge, and my father in law spread the ashes around the base.  My kids hung up some trinkets they had brought that reminded them of their grandma, and everyone had brought a stone from her collection to stack on the spot.  After we had done this, my father in law sat down and started crying.  It was hard to watch, as he had never displayed that kind of emotion around me before.  My older daughter sat down next to him and they just sat there for a while and looked out on the valley ahead of them.  She was the most in tune with her grandfather of all the grandchildren.  She was the oldest, and had recently spent several months living with her grandparents, and had really grown to be close with them. After they had sat for a while and came to terms with the moment, we went to one of my mother in law's favorite mexican restaurants to have dinner.  We all talked about the memories we had of her, and her personality traits that stood out.

I've been working with a Blue-headed macaw for that past 4 months, hand raising him since he was only 5 weeks old.  He was the first BH Macaw we were ever able to hatch at my facility so he got some special treatment when he got into human care.  This little guy had free range of the building once he began flying.  It go to the point where we had to put him in the kitchen since he would get himself in to some pretty high up spots where we couldn't reach him.  So after Azul began flying, we decided it was time to start training him.  Let's just say that at the beginning he was not a fan of his restricted time.  In order to work with him we needed him first to learn to step up onto our hand on cue.  So he didn't get the spoiled treatment of being allowed to fly when he wanted in our kitchen.  The first few days, he would try to bite our hands when ever we put it near him.  So Azul would then get to fly around without stepping on our hand first, as we'd pull our hand out of the cage and he'd take that opportunity to gain his freedom.  Eventually though through mostly my effort, and a little diet modification, I got Azul to accept my hand being near his perch without him biting me.  Then I began to teach him how to lift up his foot so he can signal to us he is interested in coming out.  Every a few more days of this work he finally began to put a foot on my hand, not without trying to bite me right after, but baby steps.  After we got over this phase of biting, we reached the point when he would place his feet on my hand and receive a nice little treat for doing that.  Then he got his chance to fly around the kitchen in all its freedom for a few hours until we needed him to go back.  With lots of hard work Azul learned that he could get what he wanted by stepping out nicely and not trying to knaw on the hand that feeds him.", "label": "retold", "group": "FMZCKJGM"}

I spent my first weekend away since giving birth to my son and I really needed it. He is 18 months and was with my boyfriend, his father the whole weekend. When I came back Sunday afternoon, I saw that my son's toe was really red. I was worried about it and he kept pointing to it, even though he could not talk, I could tell it was bothering him. We called the doctor on the video call to try and see if they would give us some advice and ultimately we had to go into urgent care. We only had 20 minutes before the urgent care would stop taking patients so by that time I rushed over and got him checked in. I was so worried it would be something bad. Since it was his big toe, worst case scenario, he would lose it and never be able to walk right again. Turns out it was just cellulitis which is an infection but nothing severe. We were given antibiotics for my little man and went on our way. A few days later our son wakes up from his nap with a hot of red bumps and spots all over his body. We rush to the doctor because we are so worried about what it might be, bug bites, measels, etc. But we find out it was just a delayed reaction to the antibiotics. I am personally allergic to penicillin and turns out my son was allergic as well and I didn't realize amoxicillin was a type of penicillin. We stopped the antibiotics because he was all better anyway and gave him an antihistimine and now he is 100% better now", "label": "recalled", "group": "ZA1TG77U"}

The most memorable part of this is the way he acted after the abuse each time. He would apologize like he had done something minor, like forgetting to read me a bedtime story. He just acted like what happened was something that he could apologize and move on from. I will never forget the way he dismissed his own behavior. However, his behavior ended up ruining mine and my siblings' lives. I fear that if I ever see him again or that if he has more children in the future, the abuse will continue once more. I hope that he does not remarry a woman that has children of her own as well. I fear that if he becomes involved with a wife or other children, he will abuse them as well. The abuse has been significant to my life because it has led to a chain of events that have landed me in foster care. After a teacher noticed the bruises, she told officials. Officials investigated the situation of my home life and immediately determined that I was not safe at home with my father. Since my mother is not in the picture, I was placed immediately into foster care. This did not only affect me, however. My siblings were abused and place into foster care as well. We were placed with different foster families and I have not seen my sibling since. I miss my siblings, and as much as my home was an unhappy place, I miss having a home to call my own. I feel that I have no one in the world that truly knows me or that I can depend on. I just feel very alone. It is hard for me to talk about anyone about this since it is a very personal experience that only a few other that have been through it can understand. It helps a little bit to write out my feelings in this diary, but it is not the same as talking to a trusted person that understands how I feel. The actions of my father have changed my life for the worse. I have lost my family and my home. I do not feel safe anymore since he started abusing me and my siblings.

They have a while and they are highly responsible. The odds are quite slim but sometimes the fear feels so real. I would have panic attacks in the middle of the night several days throughout the week over these dark thought I sought counseling immediately and that has helped me greatly where I had to slowly change my thought process into a positive . I am now in recovery where my body sometimes misses the anxiety because its been a part of my life for about a year and I have slight relapses every now and then. I used to have weekly sessions with my counselors, but I developed the tools and actions where I only go check-ups. Sort of like visiting a doctor.", "label": "recalled", "group": "SQK4Z5VL"}

Too typical of me I procrastinated, DMV sent me the renewal notice about two months in advance and I was down to about a week before the due date when I finally decided to get it done.  But by then the Check Engine light had come on in the dash which meant the truck likely would not pass the emissions test which is required for the vehicle registration.  Going to the autoparts store I found and bought a relatively inexpensive computer that plugs into a connector under the dash and gives you more information about why the Check Engine light is on.  More appealing to me was the ability of this computer to clear the vehicle's error log and I did exactly that, this turned off the Check Engine light and I made my way to an emissions testing station hoping to get a passed test before the pickup's computer rediscovered the problem.  The whole time the Check Engine light stayed off, but the truck failed the test.  The person performing the test informed me that the vehicle's computer did not have enough stored data to give their computer the pass or fail results.  He asked me if I had replaced the battery recently and I told him I had disconnected it to clean the connections just that day, don't know why I felt I had to conceal that I had cleared the error log of the computer of my own truck.  He told me that in order to pass the emissions test the vehicle's computer had to have recorded more data and to do that he advised me to drive for about a half hour on the interstate then drive on slower surface roads for the return trip, he also said that if the Check Engine light comes on not to bother bringing it in for a retest.  So instead of enjoying my weekend I spent a good part of Saturday taking a road trip, and just about when I was about to get off the interstate highway the Check Engine light came on.  I pull out my little diagnostics computer I bought from the autoparts store but this time read the error message, spent several hours on the internet getting an English interpretation of the auto-computer message, then several more hours researching what I could do about it.  Good news, a single part causes the issue the majority of the time and could often be solved with some vigorous cleaning, bad news was that due to my procrastination I really didn't have the time to try the cleaning method and would just have to replace the part, which wasn't cheap.  So the next day I was back to the autoparts store, bought the part, and installed it (it was surprisingly easy to install).  Now with the Check Engine off again and my truck's computer hopefully satisfied with the amount of data it had recorded I returned to the emissions testing station to have the computers talk to each other and hopefully conclude it was OK for me to re-register the truck for another two years.  To my relief it passed, it'd be another two years before I had to worry about replacing my truck.", "label": "recalled", "group": "S9GYZGLD"}

She had some of the breathing problems that Labs are prone to have where their lungs can't get the amount of oxygen as they need. She was the third family dog that we had had from a puppy until death. Ghost, our first, lived 17 years. Casper, our 2nd, lasted 15 years. So, after being with them for so many years, we get quite attached to them. Cheebs had been going downhill for several years and there was nothing the vets could really do anymore to relieve her problem. So, it was up to us to decide if the joy of having her around us and her joy of being around us was better for her than suffering thru the medical condition. Finally, it got to the point where we decided it was no longer fair to her, that she was suffering too much. So, my wife and I agreed and our oldest son concurred that it was time. We took her out to the car and helped her get in the back seat. She knew that she was going to the Vets as that was the only time she got to ride. We had called our Vet ahead so they were waiting on us. I got to the vet and my wife went in and told them that we were here. I tearfully walked her through the parking lot and we went in and back to the room. She was very calm, almost like she knew what was up.

So apparently Steve lost his key and ended up pounding on the door and smashing the doorbell over and over. It startled me awake to say the least. When I opened the door I was shocked to find a bloody mess. Steve's friend was holding his hands over his face, as blood poured out onto the ground. They were hysterical and didn't even answer me at first about what the heck had happened. Evidently they had gotten into a fight in the parking lot over something trivial and my ex punched him in the face. What a good friend! It was clearly a broken nose that needed to be re-set, which was a bit above my pay grade as a trainee nurse. The house was absolutely covered in blood though, especially the bathroom where Steve's friend immediately went after coming inside. Knowing that I had to get up early for work, I had no choice but to clean all the dried blood up before I laid down to finish my now disjointed sleep.

In the past few months, the baby fever has overwhelmed me, made me giddy with excitement, and brought me to tears. After a very difficult and traumatic labor and delivery two years back, I never thought I would want another one so soon. But here I was walking in the hallways, past the nursery, the faint echo of brand-new baby cries lingering into my heart. It seemed like everyone near and dear to me was either pregnant, or just had a brand new baby, something I long for so bad. But I know, realistically, right now would not be the ideal time for cradles and bibs. That time, I know, is so close, but seemingly so far away. There are things that must be done to prepare; the unchecked list runs through my head every single day. My body needs to be 20-30 pounds lighter. We need to figure out a few financial things. I need to get my dentist work done first. I need to read all the books and do all the research.  My husband, also with his own worries and fears, needs to be on the same page. Somehow my many \"needs\" have put my one major \"want\" on hold, and it's resulted in a sin called envy. I greet another tired mama, stare at another sweet sleeping babe, and hand in hand with my husband, walk out the door. We get into the car, and I let out a heavy, longing sigh. My husband, looks me straight in the eyes. \"What?\" I ask. He doesn't speak, just gives me a small smile. We speak to each other without speaking. I smile back as tears fall down my cheeks. I close my eyes and the list appears. Check. My heart is content.", "label": "recalled", "group": "ALSQRDYK"}

I work for a transit company, and we provide the only real mass transit in my city. Recently we launched an exciting new BRT (Bus Rapid Transit) line. This route has been in planning for years, and ever since I started working here I've been involved with planning, tracking, outreach, etc. It was exciting to launch it, we had the news here, tons of people, 200 volunteers from the city, and all sorts of other things. We had live bands playing at some of the stops, a DJ at the transit center, and a ribbon cutting at city hall. The exciting part about this line is that it uses a fleet of full electric vehicles, they emit almost no pollutants, and are extremely quiet. There were some hiccups. Ridership was much higher than we anticipated, so the buses were going much slower than intended. Usually the buses will run every 10 minutes, the whole line should take about an hour and a half to complete a full round trip. The line runs North to South, and we were pushing 35-45 minute wait times. The buses were so packed that we eventually had to turn people away if it was too full. After the launch we received some complaints due to timing issues. We fixed those by adding more buses to the routes. Another complaint we had was that bus stations (these are center lane stations) were causing congestion, so we improved traffic light switches for bus only lanes, to minimize the time at each stop. The city was excited and came out in force, and it made all the hard work worth it. I feel like we dropped the ball in some places, but man we did our best, and I'm so proud of my team and myself. We did some fun activities that entire week, and we have some other fun stuff in the works. I can't wait for the future lines, we have two more lines coming in the next 4-5 years.", "label": "recalled", "group": "G6HT1M6T"}

It was an away game so we couldn't go to the actual game but we had the next best thing in watching it at the stadium with 20 thousand other fans.  My dad said he didn't want to go since he couldn't handle the stress of the game but i surprised him with tickets anyways.  This was a big deal for me since my dad is the reason I am into hockey and he had been watching the Blues his whole life and they have never won it.  I knew he would regret it if he just stayed home watching the game alone instead of having the chance to be downtown if we actually won it.  It was a stressful start of the game but luckily we scored first and never looked back. We looked like a team on a mission and that mission was to bring the Stanley cup to our town for the first time ever.  I could see my dad got a little more happy and less stressed with each goal we scored like he was starting to believe we might actually do it.  I was also freaking out inside because i knew we had been close before but always got let down and anything can happen in sports. Its never over until the final horn sounds so in the back of our minds we kept thinking the worst.  When they actually did it we went crazy with all the other people at the stadium but also I could see my dad crying a little. It brought me joy to know how happy he was in this moment and i was glad i was here to share it with him.  This is something we will continue to talk about for years to come and we will always know where we were when it happened.  He brought me to a game 7 in the world series when i was young so this was also a way for me to repay the favor but i hope to repay it again sometime in our lifetime with an actual game ticket.

Lots of my family members whom I don't get to see very often were there at the derby and I got to talk to them. I talked to my aunts and uncles and cousins and their kids, and it was nice being able to catch up with them. Some of my nieces and nephews had grown up a lot since the last time I had seen them, some were entering high school and others weren't little infants anymore, and were toddling and running about everywhere around the stock pond. There was a fishing contest for all the kids, which is why the event was called a fishing derby, where they all would fish and catch frogs from my aunt's stock pond. I didn't participate in the derby games because I'm a bit too old to do that anymore. Perhaps maybe my lack of participation in the contests might have just been because I don't really like how slimy fish and frogs feel in my hands. The kids all had some other contests for them to compete in as well, and I watched from the sidelines with the adults. During the frog race, the kids all picked one caught frog, and had to coax them to hop across a finish line the fastest. But a surprising thing happened during the frog race, one of the kids accidentally coaxed their frog to jump onto me and I might have panicked reflexively. But on the other hand I ended up kicking out my foot and flinging the frog over the finish line, making my little cousin the winner of that round.

I was living in Michigan so we established a long-distance relationship. We had known each other since 2001, and had been romantic partners for about a total of 10 years, but had not seen one another for about four years before we decided to reconcile. When we reconciled, we specifically agreed to see one another exclusively. I went to visit her in Los Angeles about seven times during the long-distance relationship for a total of about 3 months. She also visited me in Detroit. In February of this year, I went to visit her for about a week around Valentines Day.  On one of the days I was with her, I mentioned to her something indicating that we were in an exclusive relationship. To my complete and utter surprise, she looked confused by my statement. She asked me, \"did we agree to that?\" I reminded her specifically of how and when we had agreed about it. The point here is that her reaction clearly showed me that she was not dating me exclusively. After discussing it with her for several minutes, she unconvincingly tried to backtrack and deny that there was anything for me even concern myself about. However, as I looked back at our relationship, it became clear to me that she had been seeing other guys while she was supposed to be exclusively with me. During the entire 17 years or so that I have known her, I was aware that she had challenges telling the truth. Her instant reaction to anyone who questioned her about something would usually be to provide a deceptive answer. She would often reveal to me the habitual lies that she would routinely tell other people and would even occasionally ask for my advice on a convincing lie to tell someone. I usually told her it was better to just tell the truth. Most of the time that I was with her, I naively believed that I was the only person that she was not lying to. But suddenly, I had discovered that I was also just another one of the many people that she routinely deceived. I carefully reexamined the prior year during our long-distance relationship and looked at it with skepticism about whether the things that she told me were truthful.  I noticed that many of the things that never really made sense to me, actually made sense when I assumed that she was lying and cheating on me. It was a painful revelation to me to discover that someone that I loved and completely trusted was constantly deceiving me and being unfaithful to me. As a result of my long-distance girlfriend's inadvertent revelation and my own soul-searching about the depths of her deception, I ended my relationship with her and discontinued all contact with her. It has been a very painful lesson to me about trusting the wrong person too much. I assumed that she would never want to hurt me in the same way that I would never want to hurt her.", "label": "recalled", "group": "T6X5DXRB"}

I got my degree in accounting in 2010, and started working full time the next year.  However, I did not research into the license that many duped the gold standard of accounting until then. I wanted to have a good career, and I look into the advancement in the accounting field.  I pass all the exams in 2013, then it was time to proceed to get the license. It was then that the CPA experience verification process comes into play and I finally got my license about 5 months ago.  Since it was a long time since I pass my exams, before getting my CPA license five months ago, I have to go through the CPE, which is a 120 hours of continuing education where I brush up on my CPA materials.  I also have to do an interview, go through the experience verification, pass two ethic exams, as well as many other steps.   I was told CPA license would open many doors and make it even easier to advance in my career or in my own business, even though I already have two college degrees.  I was happy I finally able to finish the licensing process which took me about 5 years due to various reason since I was traveling oversea the past two years and for some reason, the process was taking a long time from the other sides as well.  I was happy as that license is considered gold standard of accounting, whatever that means. I think that in term of qualification and license, that is as high as I can do for accounting.  Though that license comes with many responsibility including having to continue with professional education, as well as register for my license every few years.  The CPA exam was one of the hardest exam I took in my life.  I actually have to study and prepare for it seriously and not just cruise through it.  the materials and what I need to know on the exams are considerable.

They were all very traditional type dresses with puffy skirts, like the kind of dresses you might see on a disney princess.  She went to the dressing room and slipped on the first dress and came out for us to see.  She was glowing with happiness.  She looked like a princess.  The dress fit her just right.  The beadwork was beautiful.  The store attendant brought her a crystal tierra to try on.  My daughter's eyes filled with love for that tierra.  She slipped it on her head and gazed at herself in the mirror.  She was smiling the largest smile ever.  I  soaked in this moment and formed a memory.  I wanted to remember this day forever.  My daughter said, \"This is the dress!\" without even trying on the other two!  We all stared at her and agreed that she looked absolutely gorgeous.

She could barely walk at the end. By barely, I mean she couldn't get up. It was hard for her being on the linoleum floor, her feet sliding out from under her. One day she slid down and couldn't get back up. Her being two hundred pounds, I couldn't help her move too much. It was strange, because other than her legs, I wasn't aware of any other health problems. Its true that big dogs like her don't live too long, and she was seven or eight years, but I never thought about her difficulties more than mobility issues. I know that dogs can struggle and run if chased or pushed hard like on a sled, and can exacerbate themselves until they stroke out. Maybe that's what happened? Maybe she was so stressed and trying to get up that she blew her brain up. I don't know. I watched her panting and having bad time on the floor, wishing I could just move her to her bed at least. I think that was where she was trying to go. My pops didn't take it to well. I could hear him sobbing and crying most disgracefully. I can't imagine having that extreme feelings for an animal, but that's just me. I would not think it was a good idea to get another one of those kinds of dogs again, like I thought at first. They lie like a third as long as regular dogs and you can't help them move around if they get sick.

A longtime friend of my wife was getting married to a French woman that he met in the US.  We had booked our flights and an AirBnB in advance and gotten a good deal on both. In return for a good price on our flights, they involved a couple of layovers. We thought everything would be great because we should have arrived in Paris the day before the wedding, with plenty of time to check into our AirBnB, relax for a bit, then go to the rehearsal dinner. We ran into problems on one of our layovers in Spain. We were in the Bilbao airport, eating at a Burger King, when we got notice that our flight to Paris was cancelled.  We hurried to the airline's customer service desk to see what was going on and to get a new flight. There was already a long line of angry people when we got to the service desk. We had to wait almost two hours before we had our turn and it was obvious that everyone wanted the situation to be over. The airline's customer service workers had no idea what was happening, why it was happening and they had no clear direction about how to fix the problem. They had been trying their best to reroute people to where they had to go and in our case, we had to take a 10 hour bus ride to the Barcelona airport. We crammed into the bus with about 50 other people. Once we arrived at the airport, the bus driver had no idea where to take us and generally had no idea about anything. We did about 10 laps around the perimeter of the airport, stalling and waiting for the bus driver to be told what to do. Eventually he just dropped us off at a terminal and immediately left once we were all unloaded. We went inside to find more airline employees who had no clue what was going on. They weren't expecting us, despite having 10 hours to be told that we were coming. There was another cancelled flight from another airport that they were dealing with and it look like they all wanted to slap someone and go home. We waited another 2 hours in line to get the earliest available flight to get us to Paris. The flight was at 6:30am, which by that point was just a couple hours away. We found an isolated spot in the airport to sleep and got about an hour of sleep before security woke us up and told us to move. We were able to get the flight we had scheduled this time and we got to Paris. We got to our AirBnB in time to shower, change and rush to the ceremony.

I find it beneficial and therapeutic to write out these experiences. I believe that writing everything out is the only real way that I can begin to heal from these events. It was only a short time ago that I got evicted from my apartment. There were several reasons why I got evicted. The first and most direct reason I would say is that my roommate, Cole, moved out unexpectedly. He truly just got bored with living there and made way too much money illegally and not nearly enough money legally. It definitely took a toll on the household. He wasn't pulling his weight and he truly hated that I wanted him to get a real job. So he moved out and that was that. Unfortunately, he left less than a week before rent was due and so I was stuck paying for all the rent plus my other bills. I tried making a payment plan with the front office that ended up not working. When I was served with an eviction notice, I really went into denial and thought I could save the apartment rather than take immediate action and go out looking for a new place to live. So when it came time for court, I was told I had a week to vacate. I couldn't afford or find a new place in time and I was moving my things out of the apartment at the very last second. The problem was that I felt responsible for my safety, my fiance's safety, and the safety of my two cats. Yet I had nowhere to go. We had to take all of our belongings to a storage unit and stay in our car. We drove a PT Cruiser at the time and luckily it was pretty roomy after taking out the back seats and building a little bed area in the back seat. We made a litter box for the cats that we could put a lid on when not in use. It was hard because I felt like such a failure that couldn't even take care of my family. This went on for well over a month of having to find places to park at night and sleep, find food, brushing my teeth and washing my hair in public bathrooms, and hoping that I can find places to shower or do my laundry. The stress got to me and I wasn't sure I could even keep going. Now I'm living with my in laws and slowly trying to rebuild my life.

A year ago, we moved in together into a small house with 3 bedrooms, one for us, one for an office, and one that we described to our friends and family as a \"guest bedroom\". But we both knew it was going to be a nursery. I went off my birth control soon after we settled in. Over the past year, I've been carefully marking the calendar and stocking up on pregnancy tests, every month a little more disappointed and anxious when my cycle continued as normal. Finally, five months ago, I saw the double lines on the test, and I came running out of the bathroom like a crazy person. My fiance was in disbelief at first. (\"Are you sure this test isn't past the expiration date? Can you pee on another one?\"). We drove to the store for two different brands of tests to confirm the good news, and ever since we've been in serious nesting mode. We just had our first ultrasound this week, and not only is the baby doing great, but it's going to be a boy!  We were really surprised, since we'd both been sure we were having a girl. Luckily, I grew up with lots of younger boy cousins, and my fiance only has brothers, so we think we have a pretty good handle on what the next decade is going to be like for us.

He/she was traipsing through the back lots behind several houses on our road. This time, the sighting didn't happen on a trash collection day (the two previous times that I saw the bear, garbage had been set out on the curb for pick up).

I've had this session for a while (it was a gift) but it took me almost 3 years post-death to scrape up the courage to actually do it. I was skeptical, absolutely\u2014I do believe in spirits and that our energy has to go somewhere after death, but that's a far leap to actually communicating with a dead person. So, going into it, I was honestly more scared that it was going to work than that it wouldn't. The first few questions he asked me were basic\u2014said that he was seeing a father figure and asked me if a grandfather of mine had died. Being my age, it's fairly reasonable to assume that at least one of my grandfathers are dead (both are) and as I wasn't particularly close to mine, as he was talking about him, I was starting to write the psychic off as a phony. However, then he asked me if there was someone specific I wanted to contact, and of course, there was; I asked him to bring my friend forward by repeating her name multiple times. Immediately, things felt different. He started pulling out details about her death that were 100% accurate, and while I was definitely getting closer to believing him, I still wondered if he had researched my social media in depth or taken the time to do a deep search on people in my life. But as we went on, he started recalling things that there were absolutely no way he could have known. He pulled memories out, he described the streets I walk on on my way to work (where apparently, my friend walks alongside me sometimes). He talked about her parents, about how she feels now that she's in a different place, and asked about our other mutual friends. At this point, I was pretty convinced (and emotional, of course). It wasn't until he pulled out a very specific detail\u2014something that had only taken place in a private setting after my friend had already died\u2014that I absolutely lost it and started sobbing; I knew it was real. I was somewhat in shock; I was essentially communicating with someone that I was sure I would never have the chance to again. The session was only 45 minutes long, and I wish I could have had longer, but it provided me with a sense of closure that I hadn't felt in years.

I had some other duties as well but that was a main one. My boss, who had always liked me in the past, called me to tell me she wanted to interview this new girl. I was confused. We didn't need a new girl. I had arranged with one of my employees to continue her temporary employment through the summer and beyond. I communicated this to my boss. She did not care. She wanted to proceed with the interview. So the girl comes in.. it is obviously just a formality. I think she even had the answers to the questions beforehand. Anyway, the girl gets hired against my will. I am told to let my original worker go, which I did. OK, whatever. Then a few weeks later, my boss is coming at me more and more with just the littlest stuff that doesn't matter in the least. Stuff she had used to overlook. But now, it was all a problem. She starts writing me up for things she never would have in the previous few years I had worked there. Until one day, she also sent it to Human Resources recommending my termination.

I loved my mother very much, she was a very endearing human being and was outstandingly selfless. I remember it was a difficult adjustment when I first started taking care of her, there was a lot of arguing over who was taking care of who. Over time the arguing became less and less as she slowly started to realize she needed more and more help around the house, I think it hurt her pride to ask for my help around the house. A year before the idea of assisted living even crossed my mind we had a pretty serious incident that led to her hospitalization. My mother had seemingly walked out of the house in the middle of a snowy winter day and didn't remember doing so; she didn't even dress properly for the outside. She proceeded to wander aimlessly around the neighborhood until a bus driver took her aboard and back to the police station. Fast-forward from that event and the decline became too much to bare. I had to have her under constant surveillance as she'd slip without notice or find a way to accidentally harm herself while doing something that should have been mundane. I had managed to work up the nerve to get her into assisted living. The nerve wasn't mine alone as the doctor's also seemed to agree that it was time she entered this stage of her life and it was the safest way to do so. I agree with them and to an extent I think my mother would have too if she was still in full cognitive function. Sadly, I can only gesture and assure with kind words to her that I'm not forgetting about her or leaving her behind every time I visit. Three months have since passed and I've adjusted. I think my mother has adjusted as well but I'm still harboring guilt.

Having a mechanic glance at it would have cost more than it was worth. I went around looking for a newish used car, but I had bad credit from some delinquent bills from college.  Most places wouldn't finance a car without a HUGE down payment.  I was just out of college and had no money and only an entry-level job.  Billy Bob's Used Cars said that they would finance anyone.  The cars in Billy Bobs had the monthly payments stickered onto their windshields.  The prices were less than I'd seen elsewhere.  I was really stressed out about the whole situation.  I was stupid and I rushed through the whole process and didn't carefully read the sales contract.  In the fine print was a little mention of this thing called a \"balloon payment.\"  At the end of the loan, i was expected to pay a lump sum of $1200.  That was why the payments were so reasonable. I contacted the Better Business Bureau and the state Department of Consumer Affairs, but they both said that, while rare, car financing with a balloon payment was legal.  Just because the dealership failed to mention the final payment verbally doesn't mean that there's anything actionable in the agreement because there it was in writing.  I think the dealer and other dealers take advantage of the fact that some people just want to get the odious process over and done with as quickly as possible.  It is just an embarrassing episode that I don't like to talk about. I have better credit now, so my bank kindly gave me a loan on the equity of my now 6 year old car.

I was at a dinner gathering at a friend's house, and was ready to call it a night. It was a Friday night and the week had been a long one at work. I was more than looking forward to hitting the sack at this point. I got in my car and hit the road. Nothing seemed eerie, out of the ordinary, or anything of the sort which would indicate that danger laid ahead. The roads were slick as there has just been rain fall in the lower region of town I was in. This was, of course, expected. As I began to gain elevation on a road that led through a mountain pass towards my destination, I noticed that there was a gentle snowfall that immediately disappeared on the ground as it melted. As I realized this, I did some mental calculations and concluded that this would make the road as slippery as ever with ice patches scattered throughout. As I was driving, looking out for potential danger, I came through turn around a blind curve. As I cleared the turn, I noticed some debris from a rock slide and swerved to try to avoid it. As I did this, my car veered off of the road and hit the side of the mountain, disabling it beyond operation and repair. I called for help and the police showed up. The grandfatherly officer that was on the scene made sure that I was okay. I was. He did a thorough walk-through of the scene. As he did this, he took thorough notes that were almost mathematical in nature. As he wrapped up the report that he had been compiling, he came up to me and said... \"You know son, you are lucky. Just last Friday someone had an carbon copy of the accident you just had. The only difference is that instead of coming to the abrupt stop into the mountain like you did... he and his car ricocheted off of the side the of mountain, slid across road, and tumbled down the cliff side just right there.\" He pointed what seemed like a dark abyss down below. \"He did not make it.\", he said.

I decided against the latter and dressed myself for the occasion of wondering out to meet my fate. When I arrived at the doctor's office they started off with some simple blood tests and then ended up booking me for an extended EEG.

Nowadays my life is very beautiful only because of my lovable family. Unexpected event that changed my Life Sometimes things happen in the lives of people that they have no control over. When these things happen I call them life experience, and they often leave people muttering the words Why me From time to time, actions of others affect my own. Other times, an act of irresponsibility and immaturity on people\u2019s part could cause life changing events on our loved ones and on us. From bad events, I have learned.  If you want to be happy you should spent more time with family members. always do more things for you family makes you happy and feel proud to yourself.

When she arrived, I couldn't help but give her the biggest bear hug since it had been so long since our last meet. We decided that we would try a new Hibachi place that had opened up in town for dinner. When we were seated, we got paired with a group of people who were celebrating a birthday. Everyone was jovial and incredibly friendly. Our grill chef was also such a pleasure. Everything was going great, he was flipping shrimp and making the flames almost lick the ceiling. We stared in awe as he balanced an egg on his cooking flat. Unfortunately he made a mistake while doing his flare. Poor guy ended up tossing an egg, and instead of catching it; it landed flat on his head and broke open. There was egg all over him!! It was hard not to laugh at this guy's misfortune but he took it like a champ. After a brief recess he was back at it to finish up our dinner. When our bellies were nice and full we headed off to the carnival. There were lights and rides and games everywhere. My friend even won me a giant teddy to keep as a memory of the night. To end the evening we rode the Ferris Wheel. Looking at the city lights twinkle against the night sky was awe inspiring.

I had a lot of tasks that involved things in the house and wish I could get started on them right away.  But one of the dishes I was making for dinner later required marinading for a few hours and another dish needed to be in the slow cooker all day.  There were several ingredients I didn't have.  So I had to go to the grocery store first so I could get those dishes started.  I looked at a couple grocery stores ads and saw that one had a couple of sales that fit the ingredients I needed.  When I go to the store I notice that there are no signs at the store indicating the deals in the ad.  When I went to check out my fears came to fruition when my discounts and free items were all rang in full price.  I told the clerk about the deals in the ad and they had no idea what I was talking about.  They took a long time to ask another person, who also did not know.  Then they walked all the way to where I got the product only to find there was nothing there either, which I tried to tell them.  Then I went to the front of the store and got the ad to show them.  This prompted them to ask a senior member of the staff who quickly said yes of course give them the discount.  This added so much time to a trip that was supposed to be quick.  Not to mention I was in the checkout line for a long time because the worker was kind of slow.  Once I got home tried to make up time by prepping the food as fast as I could.  But in the end everything food wise was delayed because I got everything in the slow cooker and in the marinade that much later.

She'd  been away working in another country and she just moved back to our city earlier this month. The first thing I did that morning was text her and see where she wanted to go. She recommended the local cafe that we used to go to for lunch all of the time before she left. Best of all? This was going to be a girl's day, just the two of us, NO BOYFRIEND ALLOWED. I drove to meet her at 12:30 p.m. and we met in the parking lot at about 12:45. When I saw her, I almost started to cry and I think she did, too. She was my best friend, my person, my soul sister, and we were finally reunited after what felt like 10 years. We hugged each other in the parking lot and neither of us wanted to let go... until we realized just how hungry we were. Letting each other go, we were already starting to catch up on things when we entered the restaurant, and we even got our favorite table: the one right next to the window. It finally felt like everything was falling back together again! I asked her about her time away and she spent time asking me about Cory (my boyfriend) and I, and if we had finally tied the knot yet. I told her we were thinking about it, and as soon as he popped the question, she would be my maid of honor for sure. I told her I couldn't imagine a wedding without her in it, and then she started to get quiet. She was tearing up, and I didn't know why. I thought I said something to offend her? Maybe she was upset that I brought Cory into the conversation? I asked her what was wrong after a few minutes of silence and I already knew something major had happened before she spoke... and then she told me the truth. The reason she had moved back home is because she was diagnosed with colon cancer. She wanted to begin her treatments at home, surrounded by her close friends and family, because she didn't know how effective they would be. The cancer had already progressed before it was diagnosed. I wanted to cry, too, but I didn't want to make her upset.

Azul was hatched back in February and I have been hand feeding him since March when he was pulled from his nest box.  Having to feed him every 2 hours was hard and stressful, but after today that stress and hard work finally payed off!  Now that he has been on solid food since May, we've been trying to start his training to fly, but in order to do that, we need him to willingly step out of his enclosure and onto our hands.  We've been letting him learn to fly by letting him out of his enclosure and to just hang out in our prep kitchen while we work on cutting up fruits and vegetables for the the other birds.  Azul has been allowed to do whatever he wanted since about the end of May, but now that it's July, it is time for him to start his formal training.  The first thing I had to teach him was how to step onto my hand for a piece of food.  It was a struggle at first because he always wanted to play with our hand instead of offering a foot.  So when we'd place our hand out he would instead try to bite it to elicit a response from us (usually we'd would scratch his head so he didn't know why my hand was in front of his foot.)   For the first week of July I would place my hand by his perch and say \"Step up\" and if he moved towards my hand or lifted his foot, I would give him a piece.  Then when he got good at that, I would do the same thing, however instead for him to move towards my hand to reward him, I waited until he was fully placing a foot on my hand before he got his treat.  This past week I have been working daily with him and he has been progressing little by little.  Just on Monday he though about lifting the other foot off the perch.  Unfortunately I had to skip his training these past few days due to how busy we have been so Azul hasn't gotten any practice for the past three days.  I was expecting when I got into work today and got ready to train him that Azul would be back as square one after having those few days off.  However, instead of regressing in his training he actually progressed with out me!  When I asked him to \"Step up\" he did the cutest little hop and landed, both feet on my hand.  I was so excited that I had to remember not to jump or I might scare Azul.  It was such a moment to be held. After months of us hand-raising him and Azul getting some independence from us for a month I didn't realize how exciting and emotion filled getting over the first hurtle of training would be for me.  To hatch this gut go from being an egg to a bird who came on cue was such a joyous moment that I realized what this job was going to be like.  Leading up to this point, everyday was stressful and felt overbearing.  But getting to help these birds learn what is is to be a part of our program made me realize how much fun and fulfilling working with these babies can be.

We made our way to the outdoor area where everyone was seated and we stood to the side. It just so happened that exactly where we were standing was the entrance for the singer of the wedding. When she came out, I saw one of the most beautiful women I had ever seen in my life. I had no choice but to look at her and for a second I could swear she looked right back at me. As she was singing, I also felt she was looking at me a couple of times. I didn't think too much of it, as I felt she was out of my league. Later on that night, after the dinner portion of the wedding, as everyone was dancing, she approached me. She came over to me and asked if I was having a good time. I told her I was and that she was amazing earlier. She thanked me and asked if I liked to dance. I said no, but for her, I'd make the exception. We danced very close together and I felt like this was a once in a lifetime opportunity for me, so I asked if she wanted to step outside to get some air. She agreed. We sat outside in the cool night air, just talking and getting to know each other. She commented on how romantic it was out there, so I leaned in and kissed her. I asked for her number before I left that night, and I've messaged her many times since then, but have not gotten a response.

I really felt betrayed when he told me that he had contracted an STD. I was scared for my own health and angry at him because I know that he did not get the STD from me. He was honest with me about cheating on the ski trip and I believe that he truly was remorseful. I wish that i could find it in my heart to forgive that and continue a relationship with him. I can't find anyway to see that as tolerable and it continues to be a line crossed that I cannot move past. I feel like he still wanted to be with me and that he respected my wishes and understood my hurt in allowing our relationship to end. I wish that he would have fought for me but it makes me feel that he truly did care for me that he respected how I feel. I keep comparing any new potential relationships to him and there is always something that makes me hesitant. This guy is too tall, that guy is too skinny, this one isn't smart enough, that one is too cocky, but in reality every excuse should be that they are not Anthony. It is frustrating for me that I find myself in a situation where I want something that I will not allow myself to have. Truly does feel like a fight between my heart and my mind.

The conversation drifted to other topics that I was not expecting like charities he supports and volunteers for. I told him I really did not have time for that and I would toss a donation every now and then to a random charity. He asked me if I did that because I felt good to do something or really wanted to help. I said I really donate just to seem like a normal person and not stick out in the office as a dolt.

She was responsible for securing funds which enabled many students to go to college, when they otherwise would not be able to do so. She was fearless and tireless in her pursuit of funds to help underprivileged students. She was a joy to everyone she worked with and worked for at the university for more than 10 years. So much so that the chancellor of the university spoke during her celebration of life service. She had recently reluctantly accepted another position with a university in Atlanta, GA. She had only worked for the university for four months, when she died suddenly from an aneurysm. Needless to say her family, friends and colleagues were shocked and saddened by her untimely death. The university where she worked for 10 plus years wanted to honor her, and so the family held the celebration of life service on the university's campus. There were many in attendance and the auditorium was filled and many had to be directed to an overflow room. She was a member of my church and I know her family well, so I wanted to be in attendance. Our church choir was requested to sing. There were remarks by many of her friends, family and co-workers. The one story that was heart-wrenching and tugged at the heart strings of all in attendance was the recounting of her last day spent with the new dean who was her boss at the university in Atlanta. She told how the young woman and herself had attended a meeting. She said that she spent her last day doing what she did best, which was to secure a donor for the university. She also said that she was happy and it was a sunny day. They had taken a selfie together and sent the photo to several people. Her recounting of the young lady's last day was filled with funny stories, as the dean spoke to the tenacity of the young woman in securing funds for the school. She was part of a sorority and her sorority sisters gave a poignant tribute to her.

And since I'm in central Florida, I'm not overly close to the ocean. So this was the first time since I was very little that I had seen the ocean. We walked along the beach for a bit and chatted. The conversation wasn't overly memorable, but I found the walk very relaxing and enjoyable. I enjoyed the trip as a whole, but we tried cramming a lot of events in a short period of time, so things got a bit chaotic at points. The beach walk was easily the most relaxing part, and a really nice way to end the weekend. We probably spent an hour and a half or so walking along the beach.

Well, here we go with the explanation.  I kept going to my usual doctor and he kept doing the usual:  telling me to lose weight and stop smoking.  Anyway, as you know a few months ago, he wasn't in the office on my appointment day and I ended up just seeing his P.A.  She ordered some more detailed lab work because she was actually concerned about everything I was describing.  Well, the blood tests came back (as you already know) and she called me and wanted to refer me to a hematologist.  Went and saw the blood-doc a month ago.  Why so long?  Well, it takes forever to get in to see these guys around here.  Anyway, the new doctor, Margaret, took more blood and I just got the results a couple of weeks ago.  It seems that I have a little genetic problem and that resulted in being diagnosed with a pretty rare form of leukemia.  It's called Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia or CMML.  She also said that I have a specific sub-type, CMML-2.  This is NOT good!  Hell, I'm only 52 and now I'm being told that with a lot of totally miserable treatment, I MAY have 2 -5 years left to live.  Maybe more if I can qualify for stem cell transplant.  Heh, I may even get as many as 8 years.  This isn't fair at all, if you want my personal opinion!  My wife and I still have 2 children at home.  Sarah is 13 and Mary is only 11.  We have to tell them what's going on and it's gonna absolutely destroy them.  Oh, and I should tell you that we just recently got good news as well (well, good is a relative term, haha!)!

My friend has always wanted to be able to move out and live on his own since he graduated high school. I always love to help out friends whenever it is possible, but this situation was tougher than normal. I frequently would help him search for apartments for rent that were within his price range, but most of the time it was unsuccessful. Around 4 months ago, we had finally started seeing potential options. Once he finally found the potential one, we went and toured the complex. Everything had seemed to be going great, but we eventually found out that he would not be able to rent the apartment due to having no renters history. Now I already live in a different state than he does and I live on my own, so this gave me an idea. After giving it a lot of thought, I decided that I would offer to have him come live with me. At first, he had declined because he is not the type of person to accept handouts and he still would not technically be living on his own. I talked it over with him, and after a long conversation he accepted my offer. I've never seen him as happy as he was in that moment which really touched me. Since moving in with me, his quality of live and overall happiness have drastically improved. Even thinking back on that moment makes me emotional because i love seeing people extremely happy.

The IED blast struck a transportation bus that was mostly filled with women and children.

We could not see where one body ended and the next began due to the amount of torn flesh, blood, debris. Chaos instilled the situation with smoke, the moans and cries of the injured and the screams of pedestrians who rushed to the scene to assist. When you train in the medical field they make treating an amputation easy. You apply a tourniquet, pad the stump, then wait for transportation. I came across patients who had two hands and two feed but the area in-between resembled swiss cheese due to the shredded tissue. How do you wrap this? How do you even begin to stabilize it?

She initially declined my offer to give it to her in early 2017, but I kept it and as time progressed to this summer her first real communication back to me was asking if I still had her stick. I told her I did and offered to send it to her. She now has it and even just sent me a picture of her with it while on a hiking trip. We do have a long ways to go yet, but are making real progress. I do think that she is finally seeing that I am not the horrible person that her mother made me out to be. Certainly I am not perfect and could have been a much better father, but I'm not the ogre that my ex wife imagined. My daughter may even be coming to spend some time with me for Christmas. I'm going to Vermont with my brother and family the week before Christmas and my daughter may get to join us. All because of a four foot piece of sassafras that had a vine growing around it.

My grandmother never alluded to such a thing. I doubt she even knew for sure that my mom was not my thought-to-be grandfather's. He died when my mother was about 5. My mother knew of a man that she saw around her house when she was young that my grandmother had relations with. It was from that provided identity that I explored the tree's of some of my closest DNA connections. I found the same surname of the man in a few of their trees.

He also did not know who his grandfather is, and we suspect that his grandfather is my mother's father. His father discovered that his father was no who he always though it was after he took one. The man we believe we are both related to died in 1993 and had no children with any of his wives, so there really isn't anyone to test against to receive an answer of absolute certainty.

I couldn't find any obvious problems. I was completely perplexed. I then called the insurance company for a tow truck, but since we were so far from every city, it took 2 hours for a truck to come. We eventually had a tow truck reach us and towed the truck back the direction we came to the nearest dealership. It has been 72 days and the truck still is in the repair shop without any knowledge of what happened to it.

We ate at a real Mexican restaurant. While on the ship we got to see some shows for entertainment. Our next stop was at Progresso. Very sad place. We did another beach trip and again laid in the sun and swam in the ocean. Taking the bus back thru town after that was really eye-opening. The poverty of that town was so sad.

The first is that I got to see my oldest child build up the courage to get into the ocean for the first time. She was very pensive at first and was crying. I was able to sit down next to her and tell her that it was safe and there was nothing to be afraid of. Eventually she was able to fight her fears, with the help of her mom and our friend, and get into the water. It made me feel very proud to see her build up the courage to get in the water. Another reason is that my youngest daughter was able to nap on the beach for a few hours. She is normally a crazy kid with boundless energy, so it was very surprising to see her calm down and sleep that way. It gave me a lot of happiness to see how much fun my kids had and how well they got along with the other kids that were present.

I decided to go all out when I got up there, since there was plenty of things to do I took my time and truly explored the region of Toronto in general.  The falls were truly breathtaking, and the water was quite cold since it was still winter time when I went.  Once I had my fill of the Falls I also checked out the Chinese cuisines that Toronto had to offer, and I was not disappointed, the food was truly amazing.  The vegetables were fresh, and crisp, while the rice was truly perfect, not too hard, and not too soft, but a good balance of firmness.  I also decided to see the CN tower, and was truly mesmerized by the sheer size of that structure, especially since it was right there, in downtown Toronto.  The sunset was also breathtaking and beautiful, but I don't think that is a strong enough word for how magnificent the sunset truly was.  I loved the trip because I do love exploring and just getting out and doing something different, exploring places I've never been before, and seeing the sheer beauty and raw power of nature, like the Falls provide.  The Chinese food was quite exquisite, as was the CN tower.   I would definitely recommend a trip like this one to my friends because it was such a nice place to go and see.  I think seeing the Falls and the CN tower should be on anyone's bucket list because of just how surreal the tower was, and how serene the Falls were, with that power, and sound of all of the water rushing.  The drive was a little bit rough from Kentucky, since the traffic also isn't kind once I got to Cincinnati, and then from there it just seemed to pick up more when I got up to Toledo and into Detroit.  I think it took me about 14 hours to drive up, I didn't stay at a hotel or anything, although I did take some pit stops to get food, fuel, and other various supplies.  I think I liked seeing the CN tower most, just because of how staggering it looks, right there in downtown Toronto, and also it's proximity to the rest of the city made it a very convenient place to visit while being close to the hotel and restaurants.  The Falls were a little bit far from the city, but not bad.

It wasn't so easy for her to feel comfortable the first few nights.  When she stayed with my sister, she had always slept in the bathroom off of her room.  My room didn't have a bathroom off of it.  Also, my sister has hardwood floors in her bedroom.  I have carpeted.  My thought it that my puppy liked the feel of the cold hardwood floors at night.  I'm under the impression that the carpet may have been slightly uncomfortable until my puppy got used to the temperature difference.  To test this theory, I bought a big piece of tile and put it at the foot of my bed.  Like the hardwood, the tile would stay cool overnight.  The very first night with the tile, it seemed like my puppy slept easier and didn't wake me up in the middle of the night.  My theory had been correct.  My puppy was to hot laying on the carpet because she already has long hair.  With the tile, it gave her a nice cool surface to relax on.  I'm not positive if this had anything to do with her eating and bathroom habbits though.  She ate very little and subsequently had to go the bathroom very little for the first week.  I'm not sure if she wasn't taking well to the environment change.  Potentially she had a specific routine of which she would go the bathroom at my sisters and had specific landmarks she associated with her location.  In order to combat this, I had my sister send over the kitty pool that she said my puppy loved to hop in and out of during the day.  I put this in the backyard to my house and in just two days, my puppy's mood seemed to elevate.

One weekend, me, Brian, and my daughter Diamond were all eating breakfast when suddenly there was a loud banging on the door. \"Open up this is the police!\" a man cried.This startled me, but Brian seemed unfazed as he quickly and quietly got up from the table and started to make his way towards the bedroom. I asked him where he was going but he wouldn't tell me. All he said was to act like he had been missing for days to save myself. I watched in horror as opened the window and climbed out without uttering another word as the police continued to knock. \"Hold on, I'm coming!\" I said, closing the window and leaving the bedroom to walk to the main door. My daughter was in tears. \"Where did Brian go?\" she wailed. I shushed her, composed myself, and opened the door. As soon as I did, five police officers swarmed in and they went about raiding my entire apartment. \"Excuse me. What is going on?\" I said. One of the police officers told me that they were looking for my boyfriend as apparently he had murdered his father. I did my best to remain calm. \"He asked if I had seen him around lately. I lied and told him no and that it had been a few days. \"He's not here so please leave, you all are scaring my daughter.\" After they'd finished searching, the police all gathered around in my living room. They asked me more questions about Brian and then they left, saying that they'd let me know when they found him. I remember crying for hours after the'd left and wondering things went so wrong so fast? Days later, I received a call that they did find Brian in another state and he was in police custody. He's now sitting in jail where he'll remain for 30 years without parole for manslaughter of his father William DeFranco.", "label": "imagined", "group": "V869SM3H"}

We then got ready and headed over the venue. It was so crazy hot, so I was standing in front of the fan and putting my feet in ice water to try to stay cool! We got out photos done, behind schedule, but finally it was time to hide inside for the ceremony. People started arriving, but right at the time the ceremony was supposed to start, we had a huge thunderstorm! My husband had to run around getting everyone to help bring chairs inside.

This is the highest paved road in North America and sits just outside of Denver, Colorado. We took this excursion while we were on our first vacation without kids since our honeymoon; we have been married for just over 13 years. The event was emotional because the views on the way up the mountain were striking. You could see a number of other peaks across Colorado as you made the ascent and the landscape was beautiful. There were snow-covered mountain sides and a lake on the way up the mountain where you could get out and explore. We walked a number of trails. At times, the trails made me nervous as they were on the sides of high elevations and there weren't a lot of supports around. I was stressed at times that I was at risk of falling. The most memorable part of the trip was when we came across a herd of mountain goats near the top of the mountain. They would come right up to the side of the car and had no apprehension about the presence of humans. They were fun to observe, particularly the young goats in the herd, as they would frolic and play on the hillside. Though the event was memorable, it was also something that could be frustrating at times. It was crowded on the mountain that day. This wasn't unexpected, as the road is only safe to travel for roughly two to three months out of the year. But many people were driving in an unsafe manner. Some sped down the mountain. Others were not paying attention because they were distracted by the scenery. That added to the stress of the drive, which was somewhat nerve-wracking to begin with because the road was very narrow and didn't always feel safe. Arriving at the mountain top made it worth it though, as the view was breath taking. That said, it was hard to breath due to the high elevation at the summit, as the mountain is more than 14,000 feet up. I would do it again if given the chance. I even told my wife that it would be nice to take the kids to see the mountain and make the drive someday. It is an experience that I hope I never forget.", "label": "recalled", "group": "GMRJQ6RD"}

How could this happen? I live in Illinois and my grandma lived in Florida. At the time, I did not have a good enough job to be able to afford a trip down to Florida. I felt absolutely broken about this, as I had not seen her in years and knew that I would not be able to see my grandmother ever again. Fortunately my mom was able to afford the trip down there to be with my grandmother as she passed on. I wish I could have been there for my mother as sh went through that as well. We had hope at first that strong antibiotics would knock the infection out of her system, but old age was working against her and the drugs were not working at all. She passed away peacefully in hospice care surrounded by her family, which is exactly what her wishes were. I know she did not suffer. She did not feel any pain due to the miracle of modern medicine.  I still feel terrible that I was not able to be with her, but I also know that she knew I loved her and that we will see each other again someday.

My office and coworkers are both as nice as I could have asked for too, so I'm pretty excited for the first time in a long while. I spent months and months stressed out and depressed about not having any work, so this is big. I was declined by more companies than I could count during my job search. I really started to look inward and blame myself too, which I have now learned is the wrong way to interpret the situation. Some of the online classes I've been taking have really helped me see how poor my mindset was for all those years. I really regret not getting a handle on my depression earlier. These classes are truly helping me in ways I never imagined, and I know I can translate some of what I'm learning into my daily life both personally and professionally. Any stress I might experience at work will not affect me in the ways it used to in the past. That much I know for sure!

I am passionate about both; however, my long-term goal is to hold a district-level or higher leadership position in career and technical education.  In the district I have worked for the last several years, I was given the opportunity to be both special education teacher and career and technical education coordinator.  I had to do both simultaneously and I was given about a $2000 increase in pay for the added responsibility.  I had this unique arrangement for one year.  It was the most stressful year of my life and I routinely worked over 80 hours a week.  Toward the end of the year, I knew I was not going to be able to continue in this arrangement.  However, the district was putting forth a referendum to the community and one outcome of a passed referendum would be enough funding to split the career and technical education job off and make it standalone.  Unfortunately, the referendum failed and there was no money to pay for the jobs to be separate.  This meant I had to make a very difficult, tough decision to give up on career and technical education administration for the time being and take a job as a special education teacher in a neighboring district.  This was one of the hardest choices I have had to make; but, for the first time ever, I put myself and family ahead of my career and made the switch.  Then, a few weeks ago, the assistant superintendent of my former district called me and said they had found a way to offer me the career and technical education administration position without special education responsibilities, which is what I had originally been looking for.  However, I would have to also be the district's data and assessment coordinator and my salary would still be the same.  The chance to continue down the path of my career aspirations was so incredibly tantalizing.  On the other hand, the school year is about to start and I really like my new district a lot, the community is supportive, benefits are excellent, and I feel good about my future there.  The difficulty of the decision felt suffocating.  I actually threw up I was so anxious about it.  But, in the end, I decided to stick with my choice to take care of myself and told my old district that I could not come back.

The first time I went in I thought it was like a soak that you would do in a hot tub. I was wrong, very wrong. It was more like a spa experience where you are expected to do temperature treatments in the water. Going back and forth between hot and cold while you clean/scrub your body. I felt great afterward, my skin was so soft. I quickly became comfortable with my body and it wasn\u2019t an issue.

I was struggling pretty badly financially-wise these past couple of years as most of my focus is on my son and what he needs, but I decided some months ago that it was time to start saving up money for this big purchase. I spent countless weeks researching the best options in regards to safety, reliability, and price and I finally figured out what I really wanted to choose. I also read reviews on different dealerships as my credit is not quite the best so I had to make sure I went to a place that could qualify me without too much of a hassle. After I had found the right place, I planned a day to go down and search for a car that fit my criteria. Surprisingly, I was able to find a car right away. I took it for a test drive and immediately fell in love with it. After we got back to the lot, I made sure I asked all the right questions so I would not have any surprises (particularly bad ones) down the road.

I kept getting those excited butterflies in my stomach and could not wait to get the keys to this car. I could not wait to drive my son around and tell him that mommy got this all on her own and I was so proud of myself and I hope that one day he would be proud of me as well.

He practiced his heart out each day for up to an hour or more for years and took private lessons as well as lessons at school.  Difficulty arose when he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and started suffering from delusions at the young age of only nine.   His mind gave him difficulty concentrating to say the least.  He had periods of wellness and periods of struggle and fights in his brain over what was reality and was wasn't.  The years went by with many changes in medications and suffering on his part due to the side effects of his medications.  I didn't know if he would be able to make it to participate in such a challenging endeavor.  He works so hard, but his mind is constantly giving him a fight.  He went into the school year optimistic and fully devoted to doing his best.  The year pressed on and he pressed on as well practicing and attending doctor's visits to keep him well.  He had some bounces up and down with medication adjustments needed.  He kept fighting the fight and practicing.  He played when he could and took a rest break in the halls when needed.  Others didn't see the struggles except in his section of the band occasionally they would see a tear come from his eyes before he had to take a break in the hall.  His struggles were mostly hidden except to me who could observe his pain and sorrow even though he didn't even know what was causing it.  Bipolar is a hidden illness because you have to keep it hidden to stay afloat in the real world.  It causes symptoms that aren't even understood by the person experiencing them.  Sadness comes without any warning or preceding events.  Sometimes silliness comes without even anything to joke about.  It is odd, but can stop you in your tracks.

It was very busy there, but it's basically the same place I remembered it to be.   We were able to go to Anakeesta and everything.   It is different since the fires, though.  We spent the next few days shopping all the various stores in Pigeon Forge.  It's always a treat to go to the Walmart in the area, it's so different than all the other Walmarts I've been to.

My job had to cut back my hours, so income has been tight and I have been running a little behind on bills. I have good credit and have never needed to take out a loan before. I figured now may be a good time to try, so I can pay down my outstanding debt before it gets out of hand. I was very nervous to apply. It took me a few days to get up the strength to do so. But then... my application was denied. At first, I felt guilty. Worthless. Like a failure. After a while, I started to feel frustrated and helpless. I don't even know why I was denied since my credit history is great and credit score is 750. I've never defaulted on a loan---in fact, I have never even taken one out before. So my only guess is my lower income resulted in the denial. How is someone supposed to get ahead in this world?", "label": "recalled", "group": "I7LTJT3B"}

I was a major part in starting this program back in the summer of 2009. Since the beginning our our program we have fielded about 65 teams. 3 of them have won our league championship. This summer I took a team that had a losing record and tried to become the 4th team in our history to complete a championship run.  The season started off well and the boys responded well to all the training and upgraded competition.  We found ourselves as the number 2 seed in our division and the number 6 seed overall out of 45 teams. Things turned for the worst when we lost to a team we had beat 4 times earlier. We needed to win the next 2 games and keep our runs against down just to advance into the playoffs as a wildcard team. Somehow we found a way and won 2 very close games. The next morning we played in the quarterfinal against the team we lost to prior. Let\u2019s just say the boys came to play. It was our biggest margin of victory the entire season. Our semifinal game was a nail bitter. This ended up as a 1 run game that we won in the last inning of play. On to the Championship the boys were on cloud nine! It was amazing watching them play with confidence and finally realizing they were the best team on the field. We took an early lead and never looked back. Finishing off the season with a 8-5 win and a record of 42-8. What an amazing season, one that I will never forget!", "label": "recalled", "group": "EBU4CZVJ"}

At the time, we had lived apart for over 3 years, but he remained obsessed with me. I was with my boyfriend that night, and in the morning stopped at my friend's house before going home.  My friend's garage was opened about 2 feet, and I was sitting in the garage waiting for her to get back from picking our friend up at the Amtrak station.  I was looking down at my phone when suddenly my ex was on the ground, on his stomach, sliding under the garage door.  He grabbed me and asked where i had been all night, and started pleading and begging me to tell him.  I didn't tell him where I was or who  I was with because it was nine of his business.  He then switched gears completely, and suddenly got very angry.  He was still holding me by my upper arms, when he slammed me down on the ground on top of something piled up in the garage.  Whatever it was he slammed me down on, had a peg sticking out of it, and it felt like it went straight through me, straight through my organs.  My first thought was a couple more blows like that and I would be dead.  As I got up I realized I suddenly couldn't breathe very well, and I said \"You really hurt me.\"  He didn't seem to hear me though, and so I sat down on the chair to catch my breath.  He was still angry and he hit me in the face, afterwards saying, \"please dont call the police.\"  I told him I wouldn't call the police if he would just please leave, then he saw me holding my cell phone and a struggle followed.  He started trying to grab my phone from my hands and I resisted.  We struggled for some time with it until it dropped on the floor and i kicked it under the motorcycle.  My attempts to keep him from my phone failed tho, and he reached across and grabbed my phone.  I told him I couldn't breathe and he told me I was breathing just fine. He took my phone and took off.  It was the reason why he came in the first place.  He was dying to know, where I had been that night and who I was with.Luckily, my friends came back moments later and drove me to the emergency room.  I suffered 2 broken ribs and a collapsed lung from the incident, not to mention my Iphone that he stole.Now, my ex has a pending court case.

We learn that because the land back then hid so much gold and silver, the Spanish decided to come here and exploit the natives.  The Spanish thought that the native's ways of living was uncivilized and need to be more educated. They took their natural lands and force it into property and ownership which is an idea that the natives found absurd. The natives appreciated the land in which they lived in and it was sacred but they never view the land as property . They were also polytheism, believed in many Gods such as the sun, the moon, the mountains and etc... The Spanish that this was ridiculous so they force the natives in to Catholicism.

The wedding short while and the bride walked down through a candle lined path in the woods to finally get married after 10 years at a surprise wedding none of our friends knew about just their family. It was a great ceremony quick because of the cold followed by quick photos outside where they got married. We finished the day having the reception at a popular resort drinking the night away. The dinner was Filet minion and salmon with wonderful vegetables that were out of this world great. The cake that night was amazing too and surprisingly they did not smash it into each others faces.

Another thing I asked him, was when he was talking to ask me some questions and not just dominate the conversation.

My mother liked it a little more than I did surprisingly. I felt that there was a bit little too much focus on human characters that weren't necessarily all that interesting in my opinion. The final fight was alright, but it needed a bit more focus on the monsters, there isn't much human characters can do and also a lot of the humor was awkward and fell flat.

The food was excellent. There were four courses, all of them dishes that were excellently crated. After the party, I spent the night at my grandmothers house. The next day I got up early to take the bus. Still with a sore neck from the day before, the ride back was even worse. I got no sleep and was very uncomfortable, but happy that I got to see my family.", "label": "retold", "group": "DJIX2XUF"}

My father had suffered some strokes previous to this all deadly one.  But, he came through them before and was still his cheerful self.  However, the day this deadly stroke happened was awful. My mother was home with him and they were getting ready to go on vacation to Yellowstone.  My father was a nature enthusiast and loved getting away to places where he could be closer to nature.  He always told me that it made him feel at home and brought to his heart a peace like no other.  As they were packing for this trip, the deadliest of strokes slammed my father.  My mother noticed the symptoms of previous strokes, but this time they got worse.  She dialed 911 and the paramedics arrived.  They loaded him into the ambulance and rushed him away.  My mother was able to ride in the ambulance with him.  The paramedics worked furiously on him during that drive to the hospital, and then, silence.  He was gone.  The phone call came.  It was my mother.  Her voice was full of the deepest sorrow on earth as she told me that dad was gone.

A friend and teammate of mine recommended that I spray the stuff soccer players spray on their ankles to fight through pain. One of the umpires for the game had some cans in his car because his son played soccer and would complain of pain after every game. I sprayed some of the stuff on my toes and was able to fight through the pain for the game. It was like some anesthetic type spray but spray version of it. I liked it overall and it made the most sense. It was practical and really helped me in the long run. We ended up winning the game because of me being able to play.

We started to discuss whether we went out to eat later or we go our separate way. My friends Cong asked me, \"what do you think?

If not, we should go out and celebrate, what do you think?\" She answered me with no words but a shake of a head, and then she nodded for the two questions I asked. \"Then it's settle, we will go out and celebrate later.\" I yelled \"YEAH.\" Suddenly, everyone started to ran toward the field like lab mice ran back to its cage.

As I recall, I had been awake for approximately 48 hours or so, maybe closer to seventy two now that I know about it. In either event, I was hacking away at my desktop as I always do, and I heard some noises coming from my front yard that sounded more than the standard neighborhood kid tomfoolery. It was just some kids in the front yard, I figured maybe they were going to try ding dong ditch or maybe just some hand ball. Keep in mind it was still mid afternoon at this point, so it did not seem out of the ordinary. Fast forward to about 19:00-20:00 and I hear that same noise going on again. So I wonder over to window and I see a small child near my truck. Now, bear in mind I can't be certain that what I remember is real. Perhaps it was the culmination of too many episodes of the X-Files and lasting psychological affects from my sleeping issues, but I digress. So I see a child near my truck and shrug it off as kids being kids. Then I hear the noise again, but amplified and as I approach the window, I see my levitating three to four feet in the air. I immediately dash out to my front yard, but I can see that my truck is untouched and on the ground as if nothing happened. This goes on about five or six more times of me settling back into my work and then hearing a noise, only to see my truck once again three to four feet in the air. By now, I am convince they must have placed some sort of device to reverse the magnetic polarity between the truck and the ground (batshit crazy, I know). Luckily my room mate came home not too long afterwards and stopped to ask me why I was running around the neighborhood looking for these children with this device.  Long story short, he cold cocked me and wrestled me back into the house. The rest of the night is a bit of a blur, but the last thing I remember is seeing him on the front porch talking to group of kids that I had been after. He and I never spoke about it.

We then left the house and called my dog, who followed us out. We called the fire department as we began walking to my uncle's house because our car keys had been left inside. We waited at our uncle's house for over half an hour (our house is very difficult to find) until we finally saw the fire truck come into view of our driveway. They went back to our house and put the fire out, but by then it was too late and all of my stuff along with most of my house had been destroyed. We then called my dad, who was working the night shift, to let him know what had happened. He left work and drove to our aunt's house, while we tried to contact our insurance because we had been informed that there was a chance they would put us up in a hotel while we waited on our house to be rebuilt. Unfortunately, this was not the case. Not only would they not pay for us to temporarily stay somewhere, but they also weren't going to pay for the rebuild. We had the cheapest insurance plan, which meant that the most they would do was pay off the rest of our mortgage, which was almost paid off anyways. Having nowhere else to stay and no way to rebuild, we had to move in with my great-grandmother.", "label": "retold", "group": "DGQL4DIC"}

It was a casual early morning around 4:45am, i was leaving for work at the same time I usually leave. When I made it about 10 min away from my crib i realize i forgot my lunch, so i turned around figuring since i always get to work about 20 min early I have time to spare. So i turned back and grab my lunch and headed to work. Then i saw it was a car accident on the highway and realize this is major setback. I couldn't see what it was. Waiting, I eventually get closer and see that its a 18 wheeler truck, stuck in a ditch. Something clicked in my head like this going to be one of the worst days of my life. I called my manager to give them a heads up on the situation and they told me I'll be okay, so I'm  thinking \"I should be okay and have nothing to worry about\". I arrived to work 15 min late, grab my work equipment and headed to my location. I start working and i could see the GM passing by me just about every 30-45 min. Now I'm scared cause he doesn't come around unless there's a problem. So I'm shiver-en and panicking. I ask one of my co workers who was close to the manager and they responded that I was okay and he hadn't heard anything. I'm guessing I'm good then. The day is almost finish and I get a call from the manager telling to gather my gear so i can complete a survey and leave. I didn't think much of it cause surveys are common at my job. I walk to the office and I'm there with him and the GM, they tell me to sit. I knew it was bad news due to the fact the GM was there. I sat and just thought \"Say it\". They said it with no hesitation and my heart froze for 5 seconds, I'm crying on the inside but on the outside acting like I'm okay. I'm walked out the building in front of peers who are just staring at me I'm feeling embarrassed and shameful. I gave them the key to the locker and shook there hands and left. Driving home thinking this day is something that really impact me. Got home and just sat in the bed looking a the  wall with a dull face thinking about \"What's next\".", "label": "recalled", "group": "FYR0N82I"}

I was particularly excited since most of the people at this house I had no idea who they were since it was for a friend who i am close with, but not his group of friends. So we all got to the house and of course, nobody was there since I had gotten off of work late. I find out that we are all over on at a bar down the street so I head out over that way. I meet everyone and the beers start flowing pretty generously. That evening we all took a turn for the worst as we all struggled to make it to bar close and then back to the air bnb where we were all staying. That night I ended up going home since the Air BNB didnt have any AC in it. I mean, who gets an Air BNB with no AC?! It was super humid, so it was tough to stay there. That morning, some of the bros came over to my house and we had a few beers. We headed back over the Air bib since that day we were all going to go to a brewers game by way of the party bus. Well the party bus was of course an hour late to pick us up and actually had no AC just like the air bnb which we thought was all really funny. So we partied all day at a tailgate and met lots of new people. Since none of the people who were at this bachelor party really knew eachother, it was fun to see everyone's differnet traditions and norms for getting turned up in a parking lot. We learned tons of new games and pretty much drank a truck load of white claws during teh course of the day. You know as they say, Aint no laws when youre drinking claws. So after the game, which im amazing we ever made it to teh seats, we made it back to the bus and then out and about downtown. The night ended just as strong as it had begin. That evening we all got back to the house, had tons more white claws, and i parted ways with the group since it was way too hot for me to stay there.

I have always lived my life with the question bearing down like a heavy weight: What do I want? How shall I spend my day? Too much freedom is a heavy burden.    Even though I love to sleep, and in the last month I haven't done all that much of it, I have never felt so free. Maybe it would feel different if there were a man around. I am sleep deprived and I should feel overwhelmed, but I guess I don't have time. I mean, this is the first time I have written since the Blessed Event:     I had just finished my work for Maternity Leave (  3 whole months! )I knew all day I felt different, but honestly thought it might have been the Mexican I'd eaten at lunch. But it was a crazy coincidence that after I went to my neighborhood pool after work, swimming in the slow lane, next to a duck of all things (?) I got out of the pool and felt my water break. Like a cork pulled from a bottle of fizzy champagne. ( People have since asked how I knew. Water was already pouring down my legs. I would just tell them \"There is no mistaking a bottle of champagne uncorking between ones legs!\") I got right home, waddling like said Duck from the slow lane. Two slow blocks. I have been living with my Dad and Step-Mother, as you know Diary, and my Dad recalled my Mom's LABORS TO BE FAST, so he ignored my mid-wives reccommendation to call her when the contractions started coming closer together than they were ( 5 minutes, but what did I know? Could be Braxtons I thought. Like the Mexican Food, life can send the wrong message from brain to body, I figured.)

Memory blocks pain, I am told, so that's where all those lost minutes that add up to 7 hours went.   By 1:26 A.M. I had a boy. I pushed for an hour, the hour that changed me into a mom more than anything. I now believe I can do anything I have to.

{"id": "3JZQSN0I3RW3QGLGKX7DPQ9ASH5GFO", "text": "Dear Diary, last month I went with my mom and my little sister on vacation to the St. Pete Beach in Florida. I'm 24 now, and as I grew up, my family usually went on some type of trip each year, whether a smaller one for the weekend or a week-long vacation. This one was different though, both because it was my first vacation since moving out on my own as an adult, and because it's the first one I've gone on since my parents divorced. I grew up with my Stepdad, I don't remember a time before he was my acting father, and so it was just very strange to be going on a vacation without him. My brother didn't go either, so it was just a bit of a shock overall, I suppose. Everything was so different and I didn't expect to be so emotional, but I couldn't stop myself from thinking about how everything just felt wrong, lonely almost. From the activities we now couldn't afford to do on just my mom's salary (she wouldn't let me help pay), to how I just didn't have my brother to sit and talk to once the parents went to bed. He's close to my age, and we always used to have sort of a mini-vacation of our own on these trips, bonding in a way we never did at home. My mom, sister and I had a good time, maybe even a more relaxing one without the boys complaining, but I couldn't keep my mind off of how it just seems lately like my family fell apart. I know my parents never wanted that, but it's been a rough couple of years. I barely speak to my dad now, and sometimes it's just a painful reminder that I guess he never really was technically my dad. I spent a lot of time laying on the beach cabana, letting the sun warm my face while I just took it all in. I feel different since coming back, like maybe I developed a new understanding for things, maybe got a bit of peace about the situation. But I can't help but feel sad when I think about how my little sister is growing up in essentially a different family than me; she won't remember much of us all being together and happy. She'll have memories of going  back and forth to mom's house and dad's, and I hope she just finds stability in that somehow the way I'm struggling to find it in this situation, even as an adult.", "label": "recalled", "group": "61LV00V1"}

You just wake up each day and go through the same routine as though you're on auto pilot. You wake the kids, walk the dog and go to work then the next thing you know the work day is over then it's back home to get ready for bed and start the cycle all over again. Days turn into weeks and weeks into months and you wonder where the time went while waiting to reach this destination of happiness you've been longing to find for as long as you can remember. Recently, in one of those brief moments of wonder and longing I did more than reminisce over time and it's elusive passing. I decided that I was tired of the same thing every day and tired of the waiting for something more when it's not possible to know how much time you have left. I keep waiting for this happiness like it's a destination when I had to remind myself that being happy is a mood. Sometimes it's brief and sometimes it's replaced by sadness, bitterness, or anger. I reminded myself it was time to actually live my life and that meant having more of these happy moments so I decided to get off of auto pilot and truly live. I had been at the same job for almost 7 1/2 years and it has been a great place to work, but felt stuck in a job I just had to go to because I felt it was my only option. I had found  extra work in an online platform and it was nice to have extra income in times when I needed it. I started to think about my job and how I had to miss out on things with my kids because of work and I decided to just quit. Out of the blue, I just quit my job after 7 1/2 years and decided I was going to support myself and my children by committing to work full time online so I would be a single stay at home mom. After I actually done this I felt empowered but by the next day I felt terrified because I had devoted 7 1/2 years to a job I had planned to retire from. I questioned myself and then realized, this chapter was officially over. I had taken the kids to school and it was time for me to get online and work. This was almost 3 weeks ago. It has been a struggle so far and I'm learning how to navigate my time when it comes to working online, but it's been rewarding. This destination of happiness, while I realized it's a mood and not so much a destination, I have spent much more time feeling it. I've not only been able to take my kids to school, but I've actually been able to watch my 14 year old son's soccer games and haven't missed a baseball practice for my younger son and we've spent more time hiking and going to the dog park. I know it won't be easy but I am tired of living on auto pilot. For the first time in as long as I can even remember I'm happy and that's an incredible feeling. I hope to find more work online because I need more income soon, but I feel as though things will work out for the best. Sometimes you have to choose yourself and actually live. This was my time and I'm proud to say I chose me.", "label": "recalled", "group": "U1ARFTDR"}

The reason for me going there was because I was going to meet a special friend of mine I hadn't seen in over a year. I was extremely nervous as flying is a very nerve-wracking experience for me. I'm also incredibly shy and don't like being in places full of people. On the plane I was so scared of everything. The person next to me was an older woman who didn't seem to mind at all. I couldn't sleep at all and mostly just sat there waiting to land. When we finally did I felt relieved but also so exhausted. When I saw my friend it was like all my energy had returned. I was so happy to see him and ran up and hugged him really hard. I could tell he was happy to see me too! He drove us back to his place and my exhaustion finally caught up with me and after we spoke for a bit I passed out on his couch for a few hours. Luckily he was understanding of this. When I got back up we spent a lot of time talking. It was so refreshing to hear his voice again and listening to him tell me about how his life was in London brought me a lot of joy. I stayed at his place for over a week while we saw all the sights together. I was nervous a lot of the time being in a new country and so far away from home. I also felt a little isolated being around so many people from a different country than I. All of those feelings paled in how happy I felt being around him though. When it was time to leave I was ready to go home, but I knew I would miss him immensely. I gave him one final hug as I boarded my plane back to America. My hope now is that sometime again this year I can go back, or have him come here!", "label": "recalled", "group": "T0G2K0P1"}

Right from the beginning the sheriff in town blamed me.  It's like they decided I had pushed him before they even did any investigating.  They were hostile with me right away.  It was clear that they didn't like me.  And they certainly didn't believe me when I said that I was sleeping.  When my boyfriend got to the hospital it turns out he had broken some ribs and his face was looking pretty bad.  The doctor said that his injuries were really consistent with a fall.

She is a straight A student and wants to be a dentist and chose a school that has a great dental school for post-graduate studies.  Anyway the 2 weeks up to her leaving was pretty emotional and stressful.  i thought we would be having fun and taking the time we had left before college to hang out and do some things we had wanted to but never did.  I was surprised that it was the opposite of that and she wanted to spend more time with her friends and boyfriend than be at home with mom and dad.  I mean what was I thinking anyway?  I totally get that this is her last hoorah with her pals too and they are a lot of fun to hang out with.  During the day was kind of boring and she laid around a lot.  I could tell she was bored and ready to get on with her college life as work schedules, errands, family dinner, and household chores were not going to make her want to stay around all the time.  lol  So after a week of this I encouraged her to get out and see if any friends wanted to soak u the last rays of summer and she was all for it.  I came to realize that I think she felt obligated to stay home more and be in the house with us as much as possible but the time spent doing that wasn't very productive for us or her.  i want her to be happy instead of moping around feeling obligated to stay around her parents, I mean I appreciated her sentiment and she really wanted to be with us but I also think she wanted to approval to hang with her friends too.  She was much happier and we actually had much more meaningful interactions when she knew she was free to make her own decisions.  As drop off day came up we felt really good about leaving her for her new home at school.  We know she is a fully capable adult now and those last few days or week at home seeing her grow and be her own person kind of reinforced that.  I think the parents who cry alot and are way too emotional maybe never had that connection and feel that their chances are over.  I would disagree with that as I think letting your kids grow and have freedom is what they wanted all along.", "label": "recalled", "group": "CR82C5O9"}

To make matters worse, I began exhibiting sleep apnea. I would snore and choke at the same time, sometimes waking up my kids and resulting in an abbreviated sleep.

I did not want to wake up that morning, knowing that I would have to take it out of the garage for the last time and watch some strangers load it unto a trailer and drive away into the unknown.  It felt like closing a favorite book, filled with chapters representing a happy part of my life that I could never get back again.

After the long thirty hours it took to get to my destination I get to customs and when I show them my passport I was told to sit down where nobody tells me a thing for an entire hour. At this point im terrified since this is my first time traveling internationally by myself and there are a bunch of people with automatic rifles who told me to sit down. The entire hour im picturing how im going to spend the rest of my life in a Vietnamese prison but eventually I find out that the consulate in San Francisco screwed something up and I was free to enter the country. So I walk down grab my bags and exchange some money for the taxi ride. For months I had been researching Vietnam and all the scams that happen so I knew one of the big ones was that you always take a taxi with a meter. As I walk out of the airport some guy comes up to me and asks if I need a taxi. I say yes and we walk to his car. He tells me $40 and I say meter but he says he doesnt have one. We go back and fourth for a while and eventually I accept since that price sounds reasonable, its 3 AM and I havent slept in over a day. So we drive to my hotel and everything is fine. Eventually I come to find pretty much every taxi is about one dollar anywhere in the city. Months of panning to not get ripped off gone out the window 30 seconds into my trip. The next day I wake up early and walk out of my hotel and see im pretty much next to the biggest market in Ho Chi Minh City so there are people trying to sell you everything. Once again 5 steps out of the hotel some guy trys to sell me on some tour which I read is a ripoff. Also the motorbikes are deathtraps so I wasnt interested. I tell this guy no 20 times but he continues to walk with me. Then he starts showing me pictures of him with only white people and their handwritten notes that talk about how amazing he is. Obviously a scam as I continue to walk to the market but he wont leave. During the walk some little five year old girl walk up to me and starts holding my hand which scares me more than anything. I try to shake my hand to get her to let go but she refuses. Eventually the man gets her to let go so at least now im happy he is there. I finally make it to the market so the man leaves.

No big deal, I'll just remove the corrosion and will be good to go, which I did and I was, until the next day. To my frustration I was greeted with the same \"rrur rrur\" the following day. Again, popped hood took a look not really any new corrosion, but i thought maybe the inside of the terminal connectors needed cleaning. While removing said connector it broke, not good. The corrosion had weakened the metal causing it to be brittle. No big deal, i'll just go get a new connector, which I did. Installed new connector and all was well in the world again, or so i thought. Three days later was again greeted with the too familiar \"rrur rrur\" when attempting to start the car after walking out to said car with groceries. Had to get a jump and limped back home. Back to the drawing board trying to decipher the car code. Decided the cheaply made recently purchased battery terminal connector was the issue, so got a stronger and better made one. Unfortunately while in the process of replacing said connector a small cable from the battery was accidentlly severed. After replacing the connector we now had to trace the small cable back and replace that. Finally done with all! Until I went to start the vehicle and heard the frustrating \"rrur rrur\". Stumped, frustrated, angry, happy, sad, all emotions under the sun, finally decided to replace the battery (that was tested by a shop that said it was a little low but ok). After replacing the battery peace was once again restored to the kingdom! All told, 7 days to fix the issue. Why not take it to shop some may ask? That takes money and we had none.

I was very excited to meet my new little girl but it was bittersweet.  This was my last pregnancy and although I was a tough one, I already knew I was going to miss the little details of carrying a child.  The small flutters that reminded you of the sweet baby in your belly, the wonder of seeing their kicks and movements, and the little gestures of kindness that are reserved for pregnant women were all things that I would never experience again.  I was also scared for the procedure.  With my first child, I had an emergency c-section so I didn't have time to stress about the whole surgery.  This time was different.  I worried about the things that could go wrong,  I didn't have the same confidence in my medical team that I had had with my first child.

I was worried that he wouldn't feel loved and wanted.  When my husband brought him to my hospital room, I wanted him to feel just as important as he always had.  My son looked a bit alarmed at all the hospital equipment.   My husband brought him over to see the baby and he showed a bit of interest.  He stroked her hair and said \"baby\". That's when he leaned over to kiss the  baby on her head.  The whole room sighed at the cuteness of it.  Until the baby started screaming, that is.  Apparently, he was not as taken with his new little sister as we had hoped.  She had two tiny red marks on her forehead from where he bit her.

The hospital had been pretty quiet, when all of a sudden a Condition A was called in the main lobby as I was walking through. An older man was turning blue, and had collapsed to the floor. I was terrified to respond to my first major code, particularly that I would do something wrong. A nurse was going to get the crash cart and I had to begin CPR. Thankfully, the man had a button down shirt and I was able to get to his chest quickly. He was a very large man, and I was afraid my chest compressions weren't strong enough. I can still hear the sounds of his rib cage cracking as we quickly worked to resuscitate him. The crash cart arrived, and I was able to switch off with another nurse as I grew exhausted. Fifteen minutes and several shocks later, the man came to. He was wheeled away to the ER with a nurse supplementing his weak breathsusing the ambu-bag. I think about him from time to time--I hope he's doing alright.  I don't like that I get so emotional during serious events, I've always considered myself to be a calm and rational person.

He and my mother got married when I was two years old, and were together until my sophomore year of college. It was a messy divorce that spanned continents. It took place during one of his final deployments in Afghanistan and he filed against my mother through fax. Understandably, it took me a long time to forgive him. I first reached out again when I discovered I was pregnant. He came to visit me and my son, before his first birthday. I saw him again four years later on the day before my wedding. He'd been married again himself and had two small daughters, but his wife couldn't make it as she was tending to the newborn. I'd still never met her. Did I mention she was less than eight years older than me? So in May, we accepted the offer to visit their home in Florida. I was filled with feelings of fear and reservations of entering this home built between my father and the woman that took my mother's place beside him. I was also bringing my son and husband, so it would be a packed house with little acquaintance. Somehow, it was fun! The angst and worry that I'd felt as a late teen was overshadowed by the openness and respect of the entire event. At no point were we made to feel uncomfortable and it was truly nice seeing him function as an active and present father, something he was not able to do for me because of the military. I cried the morning we left, hard. I had no clue how much I'd missed my Dad.", "label": "recalled", "group": "D6A2I9R6"}

I'm so grateful that I decided to go off and take this risk as well as my parents supporting it.  There contribution to make this happen really makes it all possible.  The sadness of really having my friends and family so far gone, is at least now not present, because of my focus on the now. It's so reassuring to see Celia's perkiness and hear the positivity in her voice.  It is such a reaffirmation of the decision to watch her show me her place that she has shown me so much before but only through her phone.  It is midday and it is hot up here.  That doesn't get in the way of just pressing her body so tightly to the side of mine as she talks about each room.  The heat is like melting us together and I feel that close to her.  Just energy of joy is bounding through my body.  Each part of the tour is revealing a part of my future, however long or short it is. As the day goes on, I still feel like a guest in the house, but that feeling is slowly riding away.  Celia prepared a wonderful salad for us for dinner, which is just not her thing.  It was great though, because it was her way of going out of her way to make this a great first day.  Washing the dishes with her really made me feel closer and more part of the homeness that I hope to settle into.  Cuddling up to the first netflix and chill and this new place really has the sense of belonging taking over.  Finding a good groove to sit in felt like I was making a long term investment.

The trip wasn't too far and the traffic wasn't bad either, we made pretty good time. The weather was nice for the entirety of the trip, mid 80's and sunny, nothing to complain about. The children's museum was quite interesting and had a ton of interactive things for the kids to mess around with. They looked to be having fun and were running from exhibit to exhibit to see everything the museum had to offer. After they had seen everything there we stopped at the cafe inside to grab some lunch before heading out of the museum and over to the zoo which was conveniently located nearby. The zoo was pretty big so we knew it would take up the remainder of the day, luckily it was only noon so we had plenty of time to see everything. We looked over the map of the zoo to see what we wanted to check out first, the kids wanted to see the large safari animals like the elephants and tigers so that's where we headed first. There was a vehicle you could board that would give you a drive by tour of the animals so we hopped on. We saw elephants, lions, zebras, giraffes and several other animals which the kids liked. They were pointing and trying to take some pictures with their phones. One of the elephants came extremely close to the vehicle and the children couldn't believe what they were seeing. To everyone's surprise, the elephant let out a loud sound that scared everyone, but the tour guide assured us that it was completely normal and to not be afraid. The children were laughing after it happened. After the ride we got off and walked around the rest of the zoo until my cousins' feet began hurting and we decided to call it a day. It was getting dark by then anyways and we left to go find a place for dinner. All in all it was a very good day that everyone enjoyed.

I went out to have another cigarette and I saw the silhouette of a creature walking by. Seeing it excited me, as I recognized it was a cat. Naturally as an animal lover I crouched down and made click-y sounds as I asked the cat to come to me. \"You're okay, come here!\" I persisted this way for awhile. The cat, surprisingly, came over to me right away without getting too close. My partner then found canned chicken breast meat for me which I took back outside and put on a plate. I backed away and let the cat approach the food. It recognized it as food instantly and came forward. I eagerly approached the cat while it was eating and caused it to bolt. I was disappointed, having scared away the cat while it was eating. I decided to go back inside hoping the cat would return. Peaking through the blinds I saw a shadowy figure next to the plate of food. The cat had returned to eat. I refilled the food and went back inside, where I watched through the blinds.  Every time I opened to door to check the cat would run and hide under the car in the driveway, but it was clearly starved so I began to slowly move the plate closer to the front door, eventually moving it just inside the house and leaving the front door opened. I sat there waiting and the cat came to the door. It was such a small and skinny kitten. I convinced the cat to come in. A sound from inside the house that scared the cat away again. I repeated this process for several hours. My partner thought I had lost my mind and was imagining a cat being there with me until she saw it herself but finally the cat was in the house again, going for yet another plate of food.

Turns out the radiator blew and it wasn't going to be possible to keep driving. The owner of the puppy said we had to be there as it was a first come first serve deal and the puppy was definitely wanted by more people than us. Without a way to keep on going, Dad called up AAA and had them tow the car. They couldn't tow the car to where we were going and then back, so we had to cancel the trip and go home.

Upon graduating I began to realize the responsibility and pressures that life was staring to lay upon me.   Before I graduated life was very simple and my only responsibilities were to complete my education and enjoy my time in sunny San Diego.

I went from enjoying the college life to stressing about the future. The loss of my father had a profound impact on my studies and my view of the world. My mother and sister flew in from far away to watch me graduate. We spent the week together sightseeing and visiting places that we would enjoy.  We also visited places that my father would have enjoyed seeing such as Naval museums and where he used to live.  It was an emotional graduation ceremony because we all knew how hard I had worked over the past six years and that my father was not there to see it through.  There were many ups and downs, including transferring from a community college to a good university, family health issues, as well as money issues.  All of these issues and triumphant events made the graduation ceremony much more meaningful to us all.

My first born was up not to long after and we shared the amazing news to her not to long after. As a baby and even till today i font think she still understands that shes going to be a big sister. After a few months of going to the doctor,we found that the baby is in good health and that we will know the gender in no time at all. I was really hoping for a boy since our first born is a girl and would not mind a little fella to hang with. When we learned it was another girl it was almost as if it was like my first born. I did not care , i was no disappointed, I was going to have 2 little daddy's girls. I also felt like I have a chance to redo and enjoy my newborn since my family in a way ruined my new parent stage with their drama. It was a very rough period in my life and will never wish that on anybody. My wife and I then started prepping for the arrvial of our new daughter to come. We got a bunch of new books, toys the new nursery is actually just completed and are awaiting for her arrival (actually should happen sometime this week). We made a budget to try to get us out of some debt and get us ready financially for the arrival as we all know that having a baby can be a little expensive.

I knew she had been diagnosed, but I didn't know how bad it was until then. Ever since then it's been constant calls, week-long trips down to try and get paperwork done, and worrying. So much anxiety that I've lost 30 lbs in the space of 4 months. Every week there was at least one crisis where my mother was overspending herself into the red because she couldn't remember getting money out of the bank that day, or signing up for multiple life insurance policies. When I first applied for Medicaid for her, I was instantly rejected and no one told me. I had to call up after a month before learning she made $195 too much in Social Security to qualify for assisted living. I was devastated and started crying. But I kept going, kept pushing, and found out that I could apply for home services because it had a higher income bracket. Getting the paperwork together from 250 miles away was hell and it took weeks and weeks even with help from my aunt who lived nearby. When we finally got it in, the Medicaid service worker who was helping me was taken off the case and her case was given to someone else, but they didn't tell me. It felt like a merry go round, and my head was always spinning. I spent a lot of nights crying when my mother would call and spout word salad, feeling like I was totally alone in the world. Everyone I called said they couldn't really help and some places didn't even pick up the phone. A long-distance caregiver, only child of a single mother, so young and trying to care for her mother with dementia when she should be having kids and starting a family. I didn't want to be self-pitying, but I did fall into it sometimes. Then I opened my mailbox and it happened. It was a letter saying that she was approved for Medicaid waiver HCBS and that she could start immediately. I dropped to my knees and started crying, knowing that the fight wasn't over but that at least I had some sort of help. Someone recognized that my mother was in need and that I couldn't do it alone. It's still been a struggle since then and she's definitely had some very bad days where I had to go down to make sure she was OK. But we are slowly moving towards someone being there at least 4 days a week for some amount of time, which is more than she has now.

The amoxicillin they put him on worked fine for almost seven days and the infection completely cleared up. On the last day of the antibiotic we noticed he was breaking out with bumps all over his face and we soon realized after looking over his body, he had hives everywhere and they were literally forming right before out eyes. I was so panicked and called his doctor right away. When we talked to him he told us it could be an allergic reaction but still wanted to see us right away. So we go to the doctor, the whole way there I am so worried he will have the type of allergic reaction that causes his throat to close or even worse, kill him. But once we got there the doctor made alot of sense out of it all. He asked if any of us was allergic to any medicine and I remembered that I am allergic to penicillin. I just didn't realize my allergy would be hereditary and I also didn't put together that amoxicillin was a type of penicillin. I was so relieved that it all made sense.

Then she broke the news that the arm was broken, and that she would have to manually set it back into place.  And she did not sugar coat that the whole experience was really going to hurt.  So I braced myself as best I could, and was so thankful that my toddler was not paying attention to anything that she said.  She set his arm, and he did indeed cry about it, but then they bandaged his arm with a colorful splint and he was all smiles again.

The provider gave him prescriptions for oral steroids, and told him to take an OTC antihistamine. He followed the orders and took his medication. It started to get better but didn't fully heal or go away. He then returned to the Dr's office, once again received steroids, an H2 blocker and told to use antihistamine cream on the rash. Same as the previous time he went to the Dr, within three to four days after the medication ended, the rash came back. Finally his PCP referred him to a dermatologist. He was given a diagnosis, but was told it could be something that may never go away, or could resolve on its own in time. He also had to go through a lot of other diagnostic tests to rule out heart disease as this condition can be due to poor circulation. He received two steroid injections and prescription strength cream. He is getting better, but the rash still flares up from time to time and it is frustrating for both of us. I want to help him and there is nothing I can do to fix this problem.

Around three months or so ago I talked with my supervisor about possibly advancing through the ranks. I mean, I've been with the company about two years now and it's somewhat strange working with people fresh out of college. Anyway, he was totally on board with that and hinted at an opening in management that would make me a team supervisor, but it wasn't really up to him (it's the coordinator's job to pick and choose promotions). So I shrugged and tried to win the part. I came in early every day, helped answer questions from the new people in the office, and even took on that extra project from the finance department. Of course, three months later that opening gets taken by some new hire. I was feeling pretty dejected but apparently the coordinator took notice of my efforts and actually gave me a small raise. That was a nice incentive, and plus I can add some finance related stuff and other employable skills to my resume. I guess all in all I'm not even sure if I would have liked the management position anyways, and it's got me wondering if maybe I should take what experience I have from this position and move on. The pay is good, about decent for a data scientist, but I'd really enjoy taking on some more long term projects or having a leadership position. Working here was invaluable as someone new to the industry and trying to learn the ropes, but if there's no hope of working my way through the ranks, then it's probably best if I part ways. I'm a little stung about the promotion, but honestly I'm not upset about it anymore. The raise was at least something, and I'm thinking with the experience I got from the finance project that I can look into a job at a bank corporation that reached out to me. It would be a smaller office and more tight knit environment, which I think I'd prefer more. Still, I wonder if I should just hold out and wait to see if I can perhaps grab another position onboard management.

This test is traditionally known to be very difficult, as they want to ensure you understand the amount of effort you will need to put forth in order to obtain the level of Black Belt.

I began stretching different parts of my body, to ensure that my body was prepared for the physical demand that is required to obtain this belt.  After stretching, I practiced a few of the kicks, blocks, and punches I would be required to demonstrate on my test.  I also went through some of my forms that I would have to demonstrate knowledge of on the test.  At 6:00p. m., they lined us up.  This signals the beginning of the test, as instructors come to the front of the studio and choose who they will be testing.  Once the black belt instructors went to the front, the lead instructor brought us to attention.  He went through briefly what we would be doing.  Following this, an instructor stepped forward and called my name.  I now knew who would be testing me for the evening.  As the other instructors called on their students, I went and retrieved a chair for my instructor. For the next hour and a half, I went through everything I had been taught since first beginning Tae Kwon Do, demonstrating each kick, punch, block, multiple times.  The jump kicks were very demanding.  I needed a fair amount of rest in between these kicks, as my age and physical shape played into this.  After this, I demonstrated each of the forms.  It was a grueling test, to say the least.  At the end of the test, I was very sweaty and well exhausted.  I received my new belt that night and went home happy.  At home, I felt very sore, which reminded me of how much physical demand is required to obtain the level which I'm currently at in Tae Kwon Do.

Lake time was super important so we made sure to get up early and spend a lot of time fishing the lake.  Although we didn't catch a lot of fish due to the time of year, we still have a great time.  It was well worth it to see that big grin on my father's face.  In the end everyone pitched in to give a really nice memorable gift to my father.", "label": "recalled", "group": "D13EQLM7"}

We picked the beautiful city of Seaside, Florida.  We planned out where we would stay, the things that we would do and how many times we would eat out.  My sister and I decided that she would pay for the beach house and my husband and I would pay for the rental van and the cost of the gas and then we would split the cost of the food on days that we didn't eat out.  We planned a pretty relaxing time and most days were uneventful and we spent 5-6 hours at the beach.  There was one day that we spent in Panama City and we toured the town, shopped and ate at Pompano Joes.  There was another day that we drove back into Destin, toured the city, watched the fisherman fillet huge fish and ate at Dewey Destin.  We spent a few different evenings walking about 2-3 miles to the beach, to catch little crabs, dig for seashells and just splash around in the water, while my sister was snapping pictures.  We spent one Thursday evening having our family pictures professionally taken and those memories will never be lost!  I seen my children having a fantastic time just being kids.  My smaller little one was getting brave the last day that we were there, riding an intertube out into the ocean just a bit.  The last time that she seen the ocean was when she was about 8 months old, so this was such a blessing to be able to take her back.  I love spending time with my family and having those memories to hold onto.  We seen sea turtles, dolphins, manatees and a baby shark, while we were on the pier in Panama City.  My oldest experienced a ferris wheel and getting to gaze over the city with my niece and sister.  We seen the cities biggest candy shop and I seen my little girls eyes, as big as saucers.  I have a new found love for my husband, as I know the drive was torture and it wasn't cheap.  I seen him playing with my kids, especially my girls that made me fall inlove with him all over again.  It made me wish that we lived closer and could experience that same things on more of a regular basis.

I was staying at my parents' house because my father was ill and in the hospital. My mother was spending nights at the hospital with him, and I would go during the day and spend all day there, staying alone at my parents' house at night. It was a stressful time. The night before my father was scheduled to come home, I woke up in the middle of the night with chest pains. I was terrified, and thought I was having a heart attack, and all alone. The pain subsided after about a minute, and I didn't know what to do, but I eventually decided just to go back to sleep. In the morning, though, I felt off, and after speaking to my mother and my husband about it on the phone, called an ambulance to go to the emergency room. I hurried to get dressed, but the ambulance was coming from less than a mile away, and they arrived while I still had my nightshirt on, over a pair of jeans. The EMTs came in, and there was a flurry of activity, with people taping electrodes to my chest, giving me baby aspirin to chew, and asking me a million questions. The next thing I knew, I was on a stretcher, being wheeled out to the ambulance that was out in the driveway. They took me to a different hospital than the one my father was in, which was inconvenient for many reasons. Once at the emergency room they taped more electrodes to my chest and hooked me up to a monitor. They drew some blood, and asked a million more questions. Then... they left me alone. My brother arrived, having been sent by my mother to come and sit with me. He was able to stay for a while, and we talked, and I waited. Eventually my brother had to leave, and the nurse came in and drew more blood, explaining that if I had had a heart attack there would be hormones in my blood that would be at certain levels for the first and second test. Eventually they told me I would need a stress test, and after more waiting, I was taken upstairs for that unpleasant ordeal. Then... I just waited. For hours. Eventually someone came in and told me that my test results indicated that I had not had a heart attack, and I was fine, and I could go home. No explanation was given for what had actually happened, which was shocking to me; I could not believe that they didn't have an answer or some kind of diagnosis, or even any kind of advice, the doctor just said there was nothing wrong, and that was it. All I got was a sheet of paper with reasons a person might experience chest pain. So, I called my sister-in-law to come and pick me up, and then waited in the waiting room, hungry, annoyed, confused, and wearing my Star Wars R2-D2 nightshirt over a pair of jeans.", "label": "retold", "group": "6GPJUV1L"}

My grades were all well enough to get in and as a matter of a fact I did get widely accepted to many law schools.  I had one major downfall, all the scholarship programs were taken, well all the ones that offer 100% Scholarship. I think it was because I didn't apply early enough and couldn't get a vacant scholarship spot. That's a major problem for me.  I cannot afford to go to Law School, even if I had a full time job I couldn't afford it.  Also, I would have to think about when I would be able to study and do the assigned homework.  I'm very frustrated right now. It has always been my dream to go to law school. I can remember watching all the crime TV shows and trying to predict out comes. I fantasize about being a high level attorney in New York city, with my name posted on the firm its self one day.  Although right now I cannot go because i simply cannot afford to go.  I've worked so hard to get in. Its brings me much pain the money it's the determining factor to taking my first step towards the rest of my life.  I don't think its over by a long shot.  I will just have to apply earlier next yet in hopes of getting a paid scholarship.  Until then, I will keep studying and work as much as I can to earn enough money to be able to carry me through what I believe to be a very rough 4 years.

The father of the child did not want to be a part of this baby's life so I ha no one to turn to but my parents.

My mom told me that she had no choice but to tell my dad and I begged her not to, fearing his reaction.  This was the last interaction that I had with my mom and I was under the impression that she told my dad, as he did not say anything to me the entire night.  The next day I went through with the procedure.  For the past 18 years I thought that my dad knew about this until a few months ago.  My sister told me that he told her that he did not find out until 5 years after the fact that I was indeed pregnant.  He told me sister that my mom phrased it as a question to him, asking what he would do if he found out that I was pregnant.  Instead of telling my mom that he would make me have the abortion he said that they would have no choice but to help me.

My buddy and I get along extremely well. Almost too well. We both have a hugely diverse friend group who love to party, so I knew this was going to be nuts. What made this bachelor party nice was the fact the wedding still wasnt for another few months. He wanted it to be in the summer rather than winter since there were more things that we could do. So for this party, we all flew out to Denver. We both got some of our close friends out there and he had never been, so he thought it would be awesome to go out there and rage Milwaukee style, in Denver. We all flew out on a Thursday since the whole party/get together was from a Friday until Sunday. He wanted to stay until Monday, but if I knew myself and our group, there was no way we would want to stay an extra day in the condition we anticipated being in. So I flew out with another friend of mine Thursday evening and arrived at roughly 10pm. Far too late to actually do anything besides have a few brewskis and meet new friends. And that is exactly what we had done. Friday and Saturday both ended up being a complete blur.

Mom has dementia and every night as the sun goes down, she becomes agitated and restless. It becomes more difficult everyday working with her because of the progression of the disease.  I know I will get very little sleep, especially this night.  However, on the night of the full moon, for unexplained reasons, mom becomes even more restless and paces constantly. I feel bad, but I must make sure the extra code locks are locked for the outside doors, to prevent my mom from going outside at night and wander off, as she has done in the past. . During my mom's pacing episodes, she also constantly repeats the same sentence over, usually, \"I want to go home\". Even though mom is in her own home, she is unaware of her surroundings, which is more the case lately. I have to keep reassuring mom that she is at home. As the full moon gets higher in the sky, the more restless mom becomes and goes to each door trying to open the door. When the door doesn't open, mom then proceeds to each window, fortunately, most window locks are higher up or too hard for her to open. I keep asking mom to sit down and watch her favorite TV shows, I Love Lucy, but she can only sit for a few moments and then gets up again to start pacing the floor. I get out the old photo albums and try to jolt her memory to something in the past that she might remember, suddenly she looks more diligently at a picture of me as a baby where she is holding me in her arms. She stares at the picture and runs her fingers over the photo, for just a few fleeting moments, she has a look in her eyes that she remembers that time in her life. She mumbles my name and I see my opening cue to talk about when I was little. Mom then starts on the story of how I acted as a child, even though I have heard this story many times before. On these nights, the dementia that has stricken my mom seems worse, robbing her of her present memory and ability to take care of herself. At times like this, on a full moon night that for just a second, my mother is herself, albeit many years back in time, that I feel a connection to her at the present, even though from a long ago memory of how she use to be as my mother.", "label": "imagined", "group": "ETF95M8Y"}

I usually buy my e-juice from the vape store but, i found out recently that you can make it yourself. It is rather cheap compared to buying a 20 dollar bottle in the store.

It's only four ingredients (PF, VG, nicotine, and concentrated flavor) compared to whatever is inside cigarettes. Not only does mixing up a batch of this stuff save me time and money, i enjoy doing it. I was just so surprised that i haven't heard of other people doing the DIY ejuice making. So, this was a striking realization.  It's fun to browse all the flavors that you can mix/make. Now i know why there are so many vape shops opening everywhere, it's because people are buying these 20 dollar bottles and it's highly profitable to the owners but, little do the the customers know it's just a simple blend of 4 ingredients. Propylene Glycol, Vegetable Glycol, Nicotine, and Artificial flavoring. Now i don't know about you but, i think that sounds much more healthier in comparison to standard cigarettes.

It was right on the beach. Living in California for all my life, I've never seen the sunrise over the ocean. The Atlantic was just beautiful. The innkeepers made mom a special birthday cake and dinner which was so lovely. They really showed us some great hospitality. Cousin Merl's was so much fun too. We got to catch up and see all of our southern brethren. Cousin Merl has a zipline in his back yard. It is awesome! Cousin Merl's place is so gorgeious nestled up in the hills. It was so green and peaceful. You don't hear any cars going or airplanes. Until he starts up his dune buggy of course! That was fun too.

I just had to go, I must go! Nothing will stop me from going on my birthday!  My birthday happened to fall on a Saturday this year which could not have been better timing.   I told my husband I want to go out on my birthday this year to the new Star Wars land!!!  I felt he had no choice but to take me, it's my birthday! Usually I do not go out for my birthday it is just too much hassle especially when it falls on a weekday. But this was absolutely perfect! I haven't been out for years on my birthday and not only is it on a weekend, but after waiting so long for this park to open I will finally get to go and on my birthday!  I told my husband this is what I wanted to do on my birthday this year and I didn't care if we did anything else or not on that day, because I just wanted to spend the whole day there anyhow.  On the day of my birthday I could hardly contain myself.  It was finally here!  My husband made all the arrangements and took me to the new and very much anticipated Star Wars land! Once inside the park I did not know where to go first! I wanted to do everything at once, see it all at once but thankfully my husband was reasonable and we came up with a plan and that we should first walk around the entire park and take everything in.Just walking around and looking at everything was breath taking. I was so happy to be here and with my husband who seemed to enjoy it as much as I was even though he's not a huge fan of Star Wars like I am. After an hour of walking around we decided we would stop somewhere to eat and I was very excited about this as well because I wondered what all the wonderful food choices would be.  Once we found a place that wasn't too crowded we went inside and sat down at a booth and only after I sat down did I realize just how tired I was.  I was just sitting there looking all around when I turn to look at my husband and he is holding out a small box on the table in front of me. He says, this is for you. Happy Birthday. In all the excitement I had forgotten it was my birthday, and reached over and took the box. I had no idea what this could be. I opened the box and see that it is a necklace that is a replica of Episode 8!!  Wow!!! I could not believe this! What a perfect day this was turning out to be and what a wonderful surprise this necklace was from my husband!", "label": "imagined", "group": "FMJYNAFS"}

My husband and I went over there for a quick dinner and to help her fix her plumbing issues. She wasn't paying attention and poured some sort of chemical down the toilet that reacted with the unclogger my husband had used. Immediately it caught fire and exploded a few seconds later. The seat of the toilet was completely shattered and went flying! If my husband and his mom were standing a little bit closer they could've been killed! I heard the explosion from the other room and came running. Thankfully my husband only had a slight cut on his back from the debris, while his mom was untouched. We all stood there in shock at how lucky we had been. Then we could only laugh at how ridiculous it was for her to pour chemicals down the same toilet we were supposedly working to fix. She always forgets stuff like this now that she's getting older, so it's scary to think about her doing this when we aren't there. Luckily my husband is a handyman and was able to rig a new toilet seat on, but not after some real trial and error. What started as a quick trip to my mother in law's house ended up being a full night of experiences! My husband and I were so beat that we collapsed into the bed after arriving home.

I was devastated. All my hard work didn't seem to be paying off. I considered, \"Should I just re-apply to funded Ph. D.'s another field closer to my already existing M.A.'s? I would probably have better chances in Religious Studies/Asian Studies...\" The place where I was accepted for a third M.A. had a good program in Philosophy, but expensive location. I literally had no savings whatsoever so even moving there, much less housing and feeding myself, would be a struggle. I have faculty support from the two M.A.'s I already received, but only one faculty member (and letter writer) is in Philosophy while the other two are in Religious Studies. Prior to applying, one of my current mentors suggested looking into \"better\" schools, telling me a degree from the places I applied won't get me a job in the future and that there is no existing network connecting my letter writers to anyone in the new department. The same person suggested if I applied to [\"better\" school, where said person is an alumnus and former admissions committee member], I may have a better chance due to connections. Except [\"better\" school], while an \"ivy league\" university, does not feature anything like my ideal program. My ideal program is strong in both \"Western\" and \"Eastern\" philosophy (and/or religion) and encourages interdisciplinary scholarship. A program I considered a good match made a less-than-ideal offer (bumping my application from Ph. D. to M.A., without funding for even basic necessities) nearing the last minute, leaving little time to make an informed decision. Now I still struggle to figure out what to do next, after receiving this sort of rejection. I have applied to graduate school four times, two times with success, and two times without. I will need to re-take the GRE and reconsider where to apply, if at all, for future educational pursuits. It has been extremely discouraging.", "label": "recalled", "group": "YTTGYJ1N"}

He confessed that back in college he had slept with my then girlfriend, which is now my wife.  He said the guilt has been eating away at him and he felt I deserved to know.  I'm crushed.

The reason I say this is because at that time something happened that changed my outlook on life.  My husband and I were driving on a trip to Boston up north and almost got into a car crash. This was a turning point in our lives to be honest. I say this also because that alone changed my way of thinking on two fronts. The first thing that came to mind was how fragile our lives are and that was scary. Also how quickly things change, almost in the blink of an eye.  During that time it happened I was taken aback because I just kind of coasted. I nor him ever even thought about life without each other so that alone scared me. I looked at things differently after that day and so did he.  We started to focus more on the time we have here because having that happen was eye opening to us both. I almost cried as I watch the night end tonight as we go into the New Year because if things had gone different in that crash him or I could be alone. So in turn be thankful everyday you are alive because things can change that in a second. Also take in each day and cherish what you have and know that it can end just as quickly. Please also don't live in fear because life is short so love the time you have here. Lastly, the most important thing is while it's okay to be scared live life, but give yourself time to realize that you need to love and hold the ones you have everyday and thank the lord you have that time.", "label": "imagined", "group": "VXLJWVYA"}

We found the perfect beach with a beautiful sunset, and I brought my fancy camera. The hardest part was the actual surprise. Lily always feels the need to be on top of everything, so we were worried she would be suspicious and figure out our planning. Brent and I decided that I would ask her to go on a sunset walk with me and he would pretend he was meeting up with a buddy at a restaurant. We had it all set up that he was about a mile down the beach from where Lily and I started walking. Many times I got nervous because Lily said she wanted to turn around and not walk all the way down the beach, so I had to keep convincing her to go on. At the end of the beach, Brent and I had laid out little tea candles in mason jars and various flower petals. When Lily and I finally reached the end it was so lovely, she was confused as soon as she saw the whole scene and Brent waiting there in a suit. Our sorority sisters were all patiently trying to hide behind some bushes and dunes. After Brent finally popped the question they all jumped out and screamed it was really funny.

We head out to a town near us that had this deserted road that people are known to trek on. It was a beautiful day for this, sunny, clouds 80-degree weather, what more could we ask for. About halfway through this road, we encounter a fairly steep embankment that crossed some water. We had to cross it to continue, so one of our passengers get out and try to guide us down this hill. on the road down there were trenches on either side from the tires digging in the mud from the previous rain. We start to head down trying to avoid the left side tire trench as it was the deeper of the two, this proved to be a difficult task as we quickly fell in the hole. Our only option was to \"GUN IT!\" as the person who was guiding us exclaimed. So we did just that, as we did we teetered to the left, we were so deep that our two right-side tires had completely lifted off the ground. We slowly fell to the ground and hit hard if it wasn't for the Jeep's Roll Cage it could've ended up far worse, but we were all fine. But stuck out in Timbuktu. So we had to call a tow truck to get the Jeep out of the ditch, we were they for what felt like hours in direct sunlight before they arrived and got the Jeep back up without a problem. While the bill of paying the tow truck wasn't fun, the day I had spent with my family sure was.

I finally found a BMW 328i close enough to ride my bike to see. I contacted the seller and made plans to see it that Sunday. I had been withdrawing cash every week to be sure I had enough to buy a car when I found one but I needed enough money in my bank account to cover the cost of insurance so I'd be able to drive it home. On Thursday I made certain to transfer the funds I needed well before the cutoff time. A little while later I got an email that the transfer failed. I found a reddit thread stating others were having the same problem. The withdrawal had to be done before about 5:00 or I knew it wouldn't be in my account. I tried throughout the day every 30 to 45 minutes or so hoping it would work. finally just before 4:30 the transfer finally went through. On Friday I checked my balance and found that instead of depositing my withdrawal once I had every single attempted withdrawal deposited to my account. I wasn't sure what to do since I now had over 400 extra dollars in my account and a negative balance in my Amazon payments account. I didn't know when the money might be taken out or whether they would only take the extra money or reverse it all and correct it with another deposit. The advice I kept getting was to not touch the money until it was figured out. I felt like I was in limbo and was extremely frustrated. I contacted the seller and told him I wouldn't be able to meet Sunday but if he still had it next weekend I would come get it. After a few days I finally received an email from Amazon confirming the error and that funds would not be removed from anyone's bank account. Unfortunately they weren't clear about what would happen to our Amazon payments account. I confirmed with the seller I would be able to come see the car that weekend and we set a time. One day I found the car was no longer listed and asked if it was sold. The seller replied that he had a flat tire he wasn't able to change and found the car had been towed from the apartment building he parked it at. My heart sank I felt a great opportunity had slipped out of my hands due to bad luck and felt a little bit hopeless about finding a vehicle. Amazon sent an email on Thursday stating the incorrect balance had been resolved and that the extra funds were ours to keep as an apology for the inconvenience I was completely floored that I just got a gift of over $400. A few days later I found a 525i that was listed for only a couple hundred more than the one I was planning to buy and it was a newer model by four years plus the interior looked new and the body was in pretty good condition with no major issues. After checking it over and test driving it I wound up negotiating with the guy for 100 less than the car I was previously going to buy so I wound up with $400 extra dollars and a car that was one model range up and four years newer for less money.", "label": "recalled", "group": "XLTIKQIX"}

It reminded me of the other time I got him some at the park when he was with his buddies which was enjoyable to all of them. Another thing is that specific day at the beach I remember looking slightly across the road and he was just there chilling on his own. He seemed to be having a fun time which is something he always does. There really isnt much to it but to see it you should have seen the look on his face. Dogs are really beautiful creatures that we care about. They are the reason for many things to happen because at the end of the day they are still cool.

We'd built this life with our home, our beloved pets, our mutual hobbies, our nights in laughing on the couch...all of it. We were sitting on our bed together, discussing the issue when we fell into a silence, unsure of where the conversation was going or what good it was doing. I remember tears rolling down my cheeks when I heard our cat, Archie, batting around a small gumball. They're his favorite toys. He doesn't eat them, just bats it around our wood floors for a while until I replace it. My husband and I both heard the tell-tale 'roll, clatter, clatter, roll' when we said, unprompted and in perfect unison: \"Get that gumball, Archie.\" We both let out a gasp of a laugh. It was bizarre, both of us uttering this weird concoction of words that no one else has probably ever said. Thinking of them in the same order and at the same time. We smiled quietly and sat in that moment for a little while. It's been a few months since then and I still think about it occasionally, especially when I hear a faint 'roll, clatter, clatter' in another room. I think about our problems as a couple and how we've hurt each other and how it will take time to heal from things. But I find that small story to be a sweet reminder of our closeness and our love for each other and our lives.

That moment when the baby first lays on your chest is magic. You go from hearing a crying baby to quiet time. And I say quiet because, besides the fact that baby stopped crying, I honestly did not hear anything else that happened around me afterwards. Looking at the baby girl was all I was able to do. Awed, amazed, and thankful for such a blessing! Brown fine hair covered her little head, she had her eyes open and her head turned towards me, her skin was pink and wrinkled, and looked soft, she had all ten fingers and toes and that felt ridiculously reassuring, even though I already knew that the newborn was physically healthy. The nurse dried her and wrapped her loosely in a newborn blanket. I was then able to hold her for the first time. She had her little fingers in her mouth and was quietly looking up at my face, somewhat expectant. I looked in the dark blue eyes of my little angel and tears of joy filled my eyes. It felt euphoric and unreal to hold my own baby in my arms. She was light and fragile, she felt warm, and she looked so content.

We had just a short amount of time to spend together to de-stress before school started again. Since we're both teachers, this was also our last time to spend together before the next school break. We also have two young children, so the added stress of spending time with them while trying to spend time together was a lot to deal with as a young, newly-wed couple. The beginning of the summer had been stressful for us because we had a lot of home repairs to do before the winter. We were quite financially strapped to get everything done that needed to be done. Many of the repairs were minor things that weren't going to require too much money. However, we also had major home repairs like getting our roof replaced that couldn't wait. Normally, we would have taken a longer, more extravagant vacation. We love traveling internationally, and we really wanted to have a chance to take a bit of time away from the children. Because of the money we had to put into our house, we were limited with where we could go and what we could do. We were able to share valuable memories despite the trip not being what we would normally do. One of the most amazing memories was when we actually fell asleep together on the beach one night, just talking and having a bit of wine. Waking up at dawn surrounded by the ocean and surf was a once in a lifetime opportunity.

So I was kind of existing in limbo, just waiting for something to happen! We were on vacation in Florida and had gone out for a really nice dinner together, to an Italian restaurant. I remember having gnocchi but I'm not sure what Justin got. I was wearing my favorite black dress and the weather was beautiful. We split a serving of tiramisu for dessert. When we got back to our hotel, Justin suggested we take a nighttime walk on the beach -- it was really beautiful on the water, there was a breeze blowing over the waves, and all the stars were out. There were, by coincidence, fireworks going on across the water. I remember having my head on Justin's shoulder and his arm around my waist as we watched the fireworks. We were being quiet and then he said something like, \"We have a pretty good thing going, don't we?\" I said yes and was feeling very content and happy. Honestly I wasn't expecting the proposal to come right then, but he got down on one knee and asked me to marry him. I was grinning like a fool and my heart was going like gangbusters. He took the ring box out of his pocket and opened it to show me, then took the ring out of the box and put it on my finger. Of course I said yes, and then he asked if he could get up because there were rocks on the beach and he was hurting his knees! He got up, hugged me, and picked me up and twirled me around. We shared a kiss and then walked back inside because it was getting cooler. We decided not to tell anyone else until the morning so it could be our secret just for the night. When we told our parents and families, everyone was so happy -- they could see how suited we were for each other.

I bought a pack of cigarettes on the way there, my first in nearly three years. I was so nervous as I sat in the lobby waiting to be called. What would the days look like? Would I be taken seriously since my addiction was to a substance everyone says you can't get addicted to? What would the others be like? Would I be the youngest or the oldest? Finally my name was called and I spent the next few hours signing paperwork, paying for treatment up front, and meeting with a medical professional. I was told to strip and put on scrubs, though the pair of pants they tried to give me were much too small, and I laughed for the first time that day when they hardly slid over my knees. I was able to keep my own sweatpants, but the horrid green scrub shirt made me feel like the inmates I've seen on tv. Eventually they dropped me off down in the kitchen where a group of people were playing Cards Against Humanity. I didn't know what the plan was for the rest of the evening but that half hour spent watching these people laugh gave me some time to get my bearings. I heard names and tried to match them with faces. I saw two others in scrubs and realized it was their first day too. Some faces were happy; others looks tired, worn down, half asleep. Dinner was challenging because I don't eat animal products and usually had the assistance of marijuana to quell the nausea. The nurse offered me Ativan but I refused; I  asked her for some when I threw up some sad lettuce and yellow rice a few minutes later. During one of the cigarette breaks I familiarized myself with the others there and was convinced to sign up for a yoga class. The class was relaxing, but I cried the whole time.

I earned money several months through Mturk and plasma selling to make enough to afford food, toiletry, proper clothing, and fees so I could go to trucking school. After getting an okay amount of money and supplies, I headed on a bus to the school in the beginning of February. I arrived in a hotel extremely confused as I was in a hotel different from where I was told I would be which gave me an overall bad feeling about the experience. Regardless I went to bed and woke the next morning too early as I wasnt given an actual time about when things started for us but found my way to the proper building eventually that day. After getting into the building everything went smoothly with learning what was going on and what the rules were and general information on what I needed to know. I earned my Class A permit before going to the school while I was \"turking\" so my first week went a little smoother than some other classmates who had to get their Class A permit within 4 days. I also read and learned the permit book in 4 days so I knew they could do it. Fast forward the first week goes by, its only classroom things like learning to shift on computer simulators and what to expect and getting our documents in. Week 2 we actually get in the trucks and learn pre-trip and backing skills. I absolutely ace pre-trip even though people still maintain today that it is the hardest part. My backing was pretty much fine as in it wasn't the best but wasn't the worst. Almost every day I was in a truck I wanted to quit and I remember wondering whether or not future me would continue to go through with this. I was scared around 50% of my days in the last two of three weeks. Fast forward week two my backing is doing great, I aced all 4 things on my evaluation (straight line backing, pre-trip, parallel parking, offset parking) so I'm able to move to road driving week three. I'm of course scared but I get it done and by the end of week three I was told I was testing slightly early than I expected (a Thursday instead of the expected Saturday). I genuinely did not feel ready as not only did i hit a curb 2 out of 3 times in my road test, I was also struggling at parallel parking despite doing it fine at station 2 in week 2. So that Thursday i went in for the test and aced pre-trip, offset, and straight line backing, but failed my parallel parking.

I noticed Buddy was acting a little slow but as she was almost 16 I expected this. I could see both of them outside chasing each other.  All of a sudden Buddy sat down and kept looking around. A few minutes later she got up, turned and looked at my mom before running off into the dark.  I could hear her breathing and Sparky was barking. We kept waiting for them but we they never came back. We ended up going outside and shining a flashlight. That is when we saw her laying on her side with Sparky standing by her crying. I could see that one of her ears was up like she had been listening to us. It was so strange how she went and laid in her favorite spot and died. This is a place she always seemed to love. There was a rare cool breeze that night and I could see her ear moving. I couldn't believe it. I picked her up and carried her over to the patio. I'll never forget how limp her body was and how sad I felt. I never have been able to fully get past it. I miss her so much. I often find that I relive that night when I go outside. Recently I went out there and stood for a minute. I have really had to fight depression. Our other little dog was sad for a long time but he seems to be finally getting better. We are still in the process of getting another dog and we keep putting it off. I guess because we can't replace her and it is still hard to imagine bringing in a new dog.

A low point in the process was the moment we were informed that we would have to add another bathroom and an extra door before we would be cleared for business.  These were expenses we had not budgeted for, and we were not prepared.  Eventually, all of the kinks got worked out, and we were cleared to open our doors.  Many people volunteered their time and expertise to help us make our dream a reality.  On Opening Day, it truly felt as though we had climbed a mountain and were standing on a peak overlooking the past six months of our hard work.  It felt very satisfying to finally enjoy the fruits of our Labor.  We had an enormous turnout for our Grand Opening.  It was quite an event and celebration.

Things went well at the start. Even though the city was a large, and expensive one, I had gotten an Airbnb for a few weeks, to stay at while I looked to sign a lease at an apartment. Rents were very expensive, which I expected, and many areas were places that I wouldn't consider living because of noise, crime, and similar factors. Still, I was able to find a  semi-reasonable, comfortable, place within a week. So finding a place to live was going well. The student teaching job, was another matter entirely. My adviser had assured me that the program I had selected, was going to start in the Fall, which was a couple of months from now, so I went about buying furniture and stuff for my new apartment. Not long after that, I happened to be looking at the courses I was scheduled to teach on the college employee portal, and I saw there were several course conflicts; I had been scheduled to teach more than one class, in the same time slot. It also turned out that these classes weren't for the Fall semester, but they were starting in the Winter. I was receiving a grant for housing assistance and living expenses, dependent on starting teaching in the Fall, and my savings were limited, so this was going to create problems very soon. I went to the campus and spoke to my adviser, and at first tried to insist that this was the course schedule I had selected. After that, he blamed a 'problem with their computer system.' Finally he told me that he had indeed made a mistake, but the Fall schedule had been set, so at this point there was nothing he could do. I found myself in a strange city, with bills I would soon be unable to pay, and no clear purpose for being there for the immediate future. I attempted to look for work for the next month, but couldn't find anything, so I ended up breaking my lease, paying a penalty, and moving home.

When Ford Motor all but eliminated passenger cars from its North American lineup earlier this month to concentrate on trucks and S.U.V.s, it turned the page on a long and storied history of now-defunct but once red-hot nameplates: the Model T, the Model A, the Galaxie, the Fairlane, the Thunderbird and the Falcon, to name several. There was one conspicuous survivor: the Mustang.\u201cGet rid of the Mustang?\u201d asked James D. Farley Jr., Ford\u2019s president of global markets, when I asked him this week how the Mustang had survived. \u201cThe Mustang is like Rocky: It survived the 1970s fuel crisis, the glam 1980s, the move to S.U.V.s. It\u2019s made it through every round of cuts.\u201dFor me, the Mustang\u2019s reprieve came as welcome news: I took my driver\u2019s test in my mother\u2019s 1967 turquoise Mustang notchback. On the rare occasions I was allowed to drive it, it conferred instant status and triggered unabashed envy among my high school classmates. Wall Street probably would have been just as happy to see the Mustang go the way of the Fusion, Taurus and Fiesta, current models that Ford said it would phase out and which Mr. Farley dismissed as \u201ccommodity silhouettes.\u201d (Ford says it will continue to make passenger vehicles, but they just won\u2019t be in the shape of today\u2019s sedan. The Focus, for example, will survive, but as a crossover S.U.V.)That\u2019s because in its last earnings report, Ford revealed for the first time that a relatively small number of products, including the hugely popular F-150 pickup truck series, accounted for 150 percent of its earnings before interest and taxes, with profit margins in the midteens. Another group was barely profitable. By contrast, Ford said its \u201clow performing\u201d products lost money, with negative margins of more than 10 percent.", "label": "recalled", "group": "3AZE85NP"}

Parents again spoke up against the vindictive leadership and the superintendent brought in another principal. It was evident immediately the principal was incompetent and had no clue how to comb her hair let alone run a school. The loving vibe became negative and toxic. After a few bizarre run ins with the principal I made the conclusion I was not going to continue working in such a hostile environment.

I carved a bong out of an apple once there, imbibing in a beer as well to numb my hand off a bit as it was sore as fuck. I expected his pudgy face to be more giving, but my knuckles seem to have connected with his jaw. I truly have no idea of what ensued as I wasn\u2019t plussed by the group of people anyway\u2026there\u2019s truly something about this part of the world that attracts low-esteemed wanderers, keen on nothing but smokes and the idea they are \u2018far from home\u2019. The most depressing, and least interesting, are the majority of gringos here, who stick to the major cities only and transport themselves around the country using buses, too afraid to ride a gas-horse into the arguably authentic corners of this beautiful country. Rural villages with a single hotel that lacks airconditioning, with the only \u201cattraction\u201d being a monument to communism doesn\u2019t make for an instagramable trip to these types. A shame, but as is expected in this day and age, where being an influencer en masse or in their social circles is the calling card for so many yuppies out here.

Their accents led me to believe they were from California, with my suspicions confirmed by noticing that one was only pretending to be blonde for conformity; roots tell no lies. I watched as they had the men park the bikes in a vista-worthy spot, angling the bikes sideways upon the head-chieftains aesthetic demands. I had seen advertisements for services which you can pay for to have a rider take you, at a pace of your choosing from the north to the south, or vice versa, for a daily rate (in less expensive lodging of course) but the look on their faces convinced me the rate they had agreed upon was seeming lower than the journeys worth.", "label": "recalled", "group": "LUMGZ6A4"}

I was so happy, I started leaping for Joy. I hugged him so tight. The next day, I tested the machine. The machine worked  so well and made me be more happy. There is a significance difference between my old machine and my new machine. My clients are even happy because the outcome of the dresses I made for them were topnotch. I started receiving more clients introduced by my old clients. The kind gesture given to me by my husband really promoted my brand very much. The day was a very memorable day for me and I would live my life to remember that day. I love my husband.", "label": "recalled", "group": "960YUSRU"}

After a few worrisome doctor visits, we found out one baby was absorbed by the other. While we were very saddened by the loss of one baby, we were ecstatic about the healthy baby girl my wife was carrying. While my wife was nesting in preparation for parenthood, I was reading every baby book I could find! By the time the baby, Ella, was born, we felt we were prepared but we couldn't have been more wrong. No amount of reading can prepare you for the immediate and immense love you feel when you first hold your child. I knew from the moment I looked at those warm brown eyes that I would lay down my life for this child. There is no greater joy than seeing something so perfect and knowing that you are the reason it exists. The first month was the hardest. Adjusting to a new baby in the house, and her sleep/wake schedule while maintaining our own routines was very taxing on our relationship. I'll admit, I could have tried harder. Unfortunately, that's the thing about hindsight, only it is 20/20. While we both love our child very much, and I will always cherish the good times, and bad throughout my wife's pregnancy; we couldn't make our marriage work. We have been separated for three weeks now. I want my family back, but I fear that ship has sank.", "label": "imagined", "group": "4YVML4DB"}

We had been down for about 2 months without a vehicle and my husband is a mechanic, but he was staying in doors all day and was not going out till dark and tried to work on it for thirty minutes to an hour.  We are also down one bathroom, the other been under construction for the past 7 years.  My husband was not working on any of it, i am not even going to go into our bathroom. I have bought tools for him, I have gotten him equipment, and I have bought him the materials.  I have gotten so mad, that it actually turned into major depression and I was just so tired and sad that I wished to never wake up most mornings.  When I mentioned doing any of these projects during the day, I was told that he needed more materials of more then one hundred dollars, and with the car he just could not figure it out even thou we had engines that he could but in. I was so mad, angry, hurt and just had given up, every time I looked at him. I had but insurance on another truck that I can not drive, just so I could get to my appointments, without begging for help from my family. I am still trying to recover from that I still can not afford the materials for the rest of the bathroom yet, we are on a very limited income. I am seeing my physiologist once a week now to get back to my normal. I do not know if or when that truck or my blazer will ever get fixed, but at least I do not have to look at them anymore.  They are covered up in weeds so that I can not see them or even see the front of the yard anymore. That is how high the weeds are there is a path to the one truck but that is even getting narrow.

Even though he is our second child, I felt many of the same emotions as when our older son was born almost five years ago. However, the circumstances were different enough that even though the experience overall was just as life-changing as I expected, it was more even in terms of emotional volatility. With our first son, we learned late in the process that he would have to be delivered early -- basically up to six weeks early, due to a spike in my wife's blood pressure. This made for a great deal of uncertainty. This time, we anticipated the baby to be induced early, and as such we were calmer throughout the process. Even so, the birthing process is a primal one, even for me, a spouse whose job is to provide support rather than actual physical labor. We went to the hospital at around 7 in the evening, expecting the process to take 24 hours or more as it had with our first child. Ultimately, however, our new baby was born healthy only about 12 hours later. There were some frustrating times during the labor. We did not have a proper \"labor bed\" because we had to switch rooms due to some non-functioning equipment in the initial room. The nurses did not notice this until my wife was about to deliver and it was too late to get a different bed. This made me slightly anxious, but I was calmed by the reassuring demeanor of the medical team. Prior to that, we managed to feel something -- anger -- that we had not expected. The doctors and nurses were very busy because of a full load of patients and multiple births happening at the same time. Because of that, the doctor who was supposed to come to our room to discuss pain relief options, including an epidural, arrived too late to have a meaningful impact on my wife's comfort level. In fact, his callous demeanor made us quite frustrated and upset. Ultimately, though, that faded into the background when our healthy baby boy was born.", "label": "recalled", "group": "V4JL07ZQ"}

My mother and brother in law were not close, but the relationship might have been worse than I thought.  I recall my mother talking about doing certain things with my sisters husband when we first heard of the cancer, including going on a long trip together and spending more time together during the holidays.  Her plans with my brother in law gave me the impression that she really wanted to get to know him as a person, and try to relate with him on some level with the time they had left.  I was hoping the soured relationship between my sister and mother would not have interfered wit the plans they had, but that might have been the sole reason for the fall out.\tMy sister was a rebellious child in her teens, which is where the negative tension between her and my mother started.  This tension carried on throughout their lives, and it all came to a head when my sister married Mark.  My brother in law was a good man, however my mother did not agree with his atheist views, as she had been very religious her entire life.  I feel that my mother resented him for influencing my sisters religious views, which had become non existent over the past few years.  She stopped going to church and stopped showing up for family dinners on the holidays, which was something we did normally at least once a month.  The older you get, the more difficult it becomes to release grudges and judgments towards people.  My mother was open minded to listening what Mark believed in and why he did not believe in god, however those intentions faded as Mark\u2019s situation got worse.  After finding out he had cancer, his attitude towards life began to change, and my mother sensed this.  She decided she did not want to be part of the negativity that surrounded my sisters family at the time, and felt it would have impacted her own religious beliefs.  \tI understand why my mother distanced herself from the situation due to her relationship with god, however, life is short and I feel she regrets not visiting my sister and her husband before his death.  My mother put god before her family and has expressed to me she does feel guilty for not visiting Mark, but told me she could not sacrifice her life long commitment to Christianity.

Overall, the trip went ok, but there were reminders of why our friendship was strained. While I do still care about her, and I believe she still cares about me, the trip cemented the idea that we're basically at a point of the friendship ending. While spending time together was nice, there was an air of separation , and almost a wall between us. It's easy to understand why. The fact that we attempted a romantic relationship that failed and tried to keep everything normal worked a while, but we can't keep that up forever. So we're now in a situation where we're close but divided, being friends for 15 years can't just be cut off, but its almost like it stops now, and we just get to share the past. We got to experience Washington DC together, but I don't think It will ever be \"our\" trip, but rather a trip we both went on. I'll at least have the memories of the museums and memorials for myself. In terms of things that happened, we had many periods of silence while even being in the same room, and at times it seems she didn't want to be around me. As I could, I would go do my own thing so she wasn't getting upset, but it was painful to do so. Realizing you're not wanted isn't a fun experience. There was never a situation where she said I needed to go away, but it was made uncomfortable by the way she acted. It's hopefully something that will heal with time, but I don't know that it will.

The weather was beautiful and I was on cloud nine as I drove down the interstate to celebrate with my wife and kids before soccer practice. I decided to take an express lane to get home faster and was exiting back on to the normal roadway when everything seemed fine. I checked my mirrors and looked back to my right, as I was merging from the left, and saw plenty of space to merge. As I was almost completely merged a felt a soft (extremely soft) bump and then a second or so passed and I heard the blast of my horn. It was such slight impact that it took me a moment to realize that I actually was just in an accident. I looked back in mirror and waved to the driver that I was going to get over to the right hand shoulder and pull over. As I eventually pulled over the driver of the car got out and started yelling and then the passenger of the car got out and was even more mad. I got out to assess my car and theirs and I see that they are already calling the police. I thought to myself that this was no big deal as my car barely had a scratch on it and theirs only had minor damage. As we waited for the police I began to process things and realized that I am probably going to be ticketed even though they were the ones that initiated contact with me and hit me in the back, but because I was the one merging I was going to be at fault.  I thought more and more about it and I reassured myself that I had plenty of room. As things progressed, I was ticketed and I talked to the other driver and she talked about how she worked at a body shop and could fix the car at little cost.

It had originally just been fifth and sixth grade, but this most recent year they added third and fourth grade in as well. This made it more challenging because being younger, they are obviously at a different stage of development than fifth and sixth graders. Organizing academic events, including engineering-related and computer science-related events that would work across all grade levels added to the challenge. Plus, I was organizing it all by myself. So I had to come up with the list of events, buy and organize all of the supplies, create and write all the directions, and organize all the teams across grade levels in a balanced fashion.

However, it all ran much better than I expected. The kids all had a great time, the teachers were very supportive during the events themselves, and most importantly the older kids helped support the younger students in positive ways. Even though it was a competitive event, they made sure the younger students were included. The principals and superintendent were very happy with how it worked out, and it helped lead to me getting my original job back as primarily a science teacher rather than teaching math for the bulk of my instructional time.

I had broken one of my molars while I was asleep, and the pain was so bad it was radiating through my jaw. To make it worse, it was the weekend, so there were no dentist's offices open near me. The pain only got worse through the day until I was curled up in a ball with my eyes squeezed shut. I finally found some Aleve and took it, which relieved the pain enough that I was able to think straight. Still, I couldn't manage to do much that day, I couldn't bear to eat, and I couldn't sleep that night. The next morning, I went to the dentist as soon as they opened and asked if they could fit me in. I didn't expect much - perhaps some painkillers until I could make an appointment - but they were shockingly nice and understanding, and the receptionist had me sign in for an emergency appointment right away. The dentist examined me, said I would need a root canal and a crown, and offered to fit me in that morning. I was amazed at their willingness and ability to fit me in, especially after the last dentist I had been to where I was always waiting for an hour at minimum and treated more like a problem than a patient, so I jumped at the chance. I paid for the root canal, he numbed me, and I spent the next two hours getting the gentlest and most careful dental care I'd ever gotten in my life. The discomfort was minimal, the dentist and the hygienist helping him were friendly and frequently making sure I was alright, and the procedure went smoothly without delay, even though I was a last-minute patient. I was so stunned at how nice and conscientious they were without sacrificing efficiency in their work. I'd never been to a dentist like that before, and I'd honestly been dreading going to a dentist because I was waiting to be scolded or shamed for my tooth problems like previous dentists had done to me. Between their kind treatment, the horrible pain being gone, and how tired and loopy I was from not eating or sleeping, I was almost in tears thanking them when they were done. I made an appointment to get fitted for my crown and walked out feeling relieved and uplifted, which was the last thing I expected to feel after a root canal.

This is a very important milestone for me because I am still relatively young and haven't been at my current employer for very long. However, my bosses felt that it was time to give me more responsibility and more money for the work that I have done for them so far. More importantly, because I am still young, it shows that I am gaining a growing reputation in my field. I work in a relatively large area in terms of population, but my field isn't very big. Most people who work in the field know one another and word spreads quickly. In the time I've with my current employer, I've already met many of my counterparts at other organizations. I've also met many of the owners and supervisors of other organizations in the field. Getting a promotion and more recognition so quickly will allow me to have more options if I decide to leave my job. Additionally, it made me feel good that I was able to impress my bosses. Many young employees don't get the opportunity that I've gotten so far so it was important that I made a good impression. I've found that people appreciate my work ethic and my hard work, which are two things that are important to me. I've come along way since college and it wasn't the easiest road, so to be working in and excelling in my field is an important sign of who I am as a professional.

I felt resentment and that he would be the same type of grandfather that he was as a father.  I did not want my children to have this negative experience in their lives.

My oldest son expressed an interest  in visiting his grandfather.   While I was hesitant at first, they had plans on things they wanted to do together and it was only for one day and back the next morning.

I only wish I could have gotten to know my fellow classmates better. I'll never know, but I feel like there were lifelong friendships that could have been had if I put myself out there.

I won't give the excuse of how busy I so frequently was, or how my involvement with band made things that much more unlikely. Speaking of band, I've had so many good and bad stories to tell. My most memorable would have to be while performing at a tournament. One of the band teams was so off their own instructor quit mid performance! I felt sorry for that group, it was so embarrassing to watch. We on the other hand got second place among stiff competition. That speaks to how close we are as a group and how in sync we were.

I started using fabric because my grandmother had so much of it. She liked to quilt and make clothes. I remember her constantly sewing something. When she died there was so much fabric stored in her house. My mother and aunts were going to toss it out, but I rescued it. Material that I found included all types of prints and solids, and even some flour sacks that were used to make dresses in the 30s and 40s. I took it all. I washed and ironed everything that I planned to use. I decided that I wanted to use the fabric to make a collage that honored my grandmother. I picked a strong burlap for my base, then I drew in a portrait of my grandmother from a picture I had. I thought about skin tones and hair and eye color. Then I matched the fabric to my grandmother's face. The cutting and sewing took me weeks, but eventually I had a fabric portrait of my grandmother made from all the fabric she had at the end of her life.  It's hanging in my living room now. I've had plenty of offers to buy the piece, but I loved my grandmother and the portrait has so much of her personality, I don't want to part with it.

{"id": "3TESA3PJ32W9O09JHN9LXLDGUCSMMX", "text": "Six weeks ago, my buddy came to me seeking some advice or help on an issue of his. He had been really stressed out at his job, was feeling burned out from it, and was having trouble sleeping. He knew that I have a background in psychology, as well general health and well being, so I might be able to help him out. We first talked about what he thought might have been triggering the stress and anxiety at work. He said that he was having trouble concentrating because he was always feeling fatigued at work. This fatigue was starting to impact his job performance because he was struggling to get all his tasks done during the work day. The next thing I asked him was how well he was sleeping at night, and he said that he was having a lot of trouble falling asleep. In fact, he would toss and turn for a while, and then he would get on his phone for a little while, hoping that this would make him sleepy. I explained to him that maintaining proper sleep health is really important in having high quality sleep. People should only ever do two things in bed: sleep or have sex. The reason for this, is when you do other activities in bed, you are confusing your brain on whether or not you should be sleeping. Because of this, when you lay down in bed, you should never be reading or on your phone because this can compromise healthy sleep. After that, we talked about nutrition. Eric tends to eat oatmeal for breakfast on most days, a sandwich and vegetables or fruit for lunch, and he usually orders takeout for dinner. This did not seem like a big deal to me, but when I pressed him about what he typically drinks on a daily basis, he says that he pretty much just drinks sodas or coffee all day, and only stops the caffeinated drinks half an hour before bed. I explained to him that this is a really unhealthy habit. Not only are you putting yourself at risk for diabetes and hypertension from that level of caffeine and sugar, but you are also making it very difficult for yourself to fall asleep when you drink them almost all the way up until you go to bed. My recommendation for him was to significantly cut out the caffeine from his diet (as well as drink more water), and try to maintain healthier sleep habits. These things have worked for me in the past, so I am sure that they would work for him.", "label": "imagined", "group": "GN57BBAT"}

Having grown up in small city in Texas, the heart of football country, I was familiar with boys like him. It was just my luck to have moved over a thousand miles away and still fall for someone who would have been at ease growing up in my hometown. I enjoy a good football game, but I'm not the type to go out to the stadium every Sunday.

He normally took his calls in his little office/man cave, rarely closing the door. In fact, I'm more likely to close it when he gets too noisy. Sometimes, you just can't help yourself. So many times I walked by his office and would be completely oblivious to what he was talking about. But this time a few weeks ago, I heard him say, \"That ring is going to be perfect.\" And that stopped me right in my tracks. Unfortunately those words were at the end of his conversation.  I back tracked to his office and tried to get some more information from him, but he would only say that he was \"just\" talking to his best friend. Sensing I was going to get anything else out of him with letting on that I may know something, I retreated from his office. I really didn't know how to feel at that moment. We both love each other and there were no real issues between the two us. It was just marriage was not something we'd spoke about yet. A little while later, I was in the kitchen making a smoothie for lunch, when he came strolling in. He seemed a bit nervous (or excited, still really can't figure which it was). He asked me if we had any plans the following Sunday. After confirming on our day-planner that we were free, he said to block the day for a football game. I readily agreed.

My boyfriends boss was supposed to close up for the night and let the dog off of it's' leash before leaving but unfortunately did not do so.

He is worried that he could lose his job over this and that would really hurt us financially since he gets paid very well for what he has to do.

There were a few different things that went wrong with the project, but ultimately the project was accomplished completely.  We initially thought the well was not producing the right amount of water.  We checked the water flow meter regularly, and saw it was only pumping about 100 gallons each week.  I emailed the team who installed the pump to ask about this.  We were supposed to be pumping upwards of 10,000 gallons each week, so this was very low.  I also emailed the consultant to confirm his projections were still accurate.  The two were able to meet on site together, and I learned that we had been reading the wrong meter the whole time.  The meter we had been reading was the water we were using from the local water source, not our pump.  Our pump meter was somewhere else on site, and it turned out we were pumping almost the exact amount.  I was able to relay this information to my boss all throughout so everyone was kept informed and didn't stress.  The important lesson here was to keep everyone updated and stay organized, and always move things forward.  I can see how something like this could cause stress in someone's life.  It's never easy to feel like you failed at work.  Fortunately, my past work experiences had prepared me to prepare.", "label": "retold", "group": "SDTOKBTK"}

We would be going to South Texas to float on fish on a river, and do some camping for several days. My girlfriend and I are in a long distance relationship, so I take every opportunity that I can to see her. We planned the trip for several months, and brainstormed many different places in Texas to go for the trip. For a while, we were going to go to a local lake, but decided that it was a little bit too primitive. For a while, we also thought that we would all be in tents, but eventually we sourced a camper from a family friend, and we thought it would be fun for all of us to stay in it together. Finally, after a few months of planning, we decided on a pretty nice campground along a river south west of San Antonio. We had heard great things about this place, so we made up our minds pretty quickly. We got their on a Thursday night (I drove alone, as I live in a different city from my girlfriend and her family) and we set up the camper. It was really hot, around 99 degrees, but once the sun went down it was not so bad. One of the things I remember most fondly about this trip was actually falling asleep next to my girlfriend that first night we got to the campground. Since we do not live together, sleeping together is really special for us. Obviously though, we didn't do anything much more than some kissing, because we were sharing the camper with other people. Over the next few days we did a lot of really fun activities. We rented some kayaks from a local man, and we went up and down the river in them. The water was super clear, and the scenery was just beautiful. At night, we had a campfire, drank beer, told jokes, and just enjoyed each other's company. Looking back, the thing I remember most about the trip was just being able to spend time with my girlfriend, and not necessarily what we did on our tip.", "label": "retold", "group": "GN57BBAT"}

My father had been diagnosed with Hepatitis B and he had carried the condition since childhood. It apparently reared its head when he reached his sixties, and it took a heavy toll on his liver. He developed cirrhosis, and as a result, he went on disability and was forced to give up his job as an automotive mechanic. The years that followed, his condition seemed to stabilize, and having time off and not having to undergo strenuous activity while taking medication meant that we didn't have to worry about him 24/7. Unfortunately, his body seemed to get worse in the past two years, and it all came to a head the past year. He has since undergone multiple procedures to remove malignant growths on his liver, and the family was told that it's unlikely he'll live past the age of 75 without a liver transplant. In any case, the past month, his condition just seemed to become more aggressive. He had issues with his bowels, he had difficulty keeping down food, and he was lethargic.

For those two weeks, my life was in disarray since I had to ferry my mother back and forth between the hospital and home at odd hours of the day, in addition to dealing with my work responsibilities.

I was able to negotiate the whole deal before and get approved for a loan before I even got to the dealership.

So, my intention was to drop him off and come home and shower and get ready and pick up his aunt and uncle who had come from out of town. Well, the plan started out well and I got him ready and dropped him off at the venue. Just about that time, two  other nearby graduations were getting out and I was in gridlock. All of the stop lights were turned off and the police were directing pedestrian traffic. An hour later, I am no further than a half a mile where I dropped him off. I had no choice but to wait it out. I had to pick up his aunt and uncle. When I finally got out of the gridlock I just sped as fast as I could go! See, I never ever ever speed. I've being driving for 40 years without a single ticket. I was in a complete panic that there would be no time to get back. I zipped home in no time. I got out and showed and dress in about 5 minutes-wet hair and all and picked up my sister and her husband.

Unfortunately, my Vegas trips typically turn into more of vacations than work trips like they should be (other than when I actually go specifically to play a tournament). Anyways, like I said, I go a few times a year, at least, but this trip was really quite special. I was down there for two weeks of March Madness, and my Uncle and a few of his work buddies were there for a weekend. I think I've been there at the same time as family members before, but have only really done Vegas with friends, so this was quite cool. It was the first weekend of the tournament, so the place was a zoo. Some of the most memorable moments were watching basketball at the bar by the sports book at Venetian. Another was hanging out at the Wynn's pool during some basketball games and having some beers. We also had a couple of great meals at a steak house at Cosmo and then some Italian place. It was really a lot of fun. I guess what made it so special was seeing my Uncle, who is also my Godfather, with his friends. They are all businessmen or in real estate, and it was cool to see them unwind. I think they go every year. I did get a little too drunk at times, so I kind of regretted that, but overall, I think we had a good time. I can be a bit of a shit show, but I think, if you're going to let loose, Vegas is definitely a place where that is allowed.

In order to save money, I have them sent from my insurance by mail order. I had just run out of the medication for my fibromyalgia when I checked my mail and found something from the pharmacy. But there was only one medication, the one for heartburn. I thought the other two may have been sent separately. I was worried because you're not suppose to stop taking this medication and even missing a single dose can make you a little sick. The first day I started getting increased pain, especially in my knees. I also started having problems thinking and concentrating. By Sunday I started feeling very weak, dizzy and like I had a bad stomach virus. I ended up really sick. I couldn't eat much and that also made my blood sugar issues worse. The pain got so intense that it felt as though all my bones were being twisted. It was like being in a nightmare. They had agreed to reconsider the medication and said it would take about 10 days. But as things kept getting worse so quickly, I wasn't sure I'd last that long. I live alone, so I kept my door unlocked in case I needed emergency help and couldn't open it myself, or to make it easier to find my body if I died. I didn't bathe for a few days because I worried I'd be too weak to climb out of the bathtub and possibly slip and die slowly from a head injury. They finally agreed to cover the medication and sent it express. I am still recovering from this. The worst of the pain is gone, but the knees still hurt. Since I also struggled with depression all my life and this medication also helps there, I've been really struggling with more depression. I'm still having trouble thinking and concentrating and my greatest worry is that my brain might not come all the way back. I'm suppose to see my doctor today to check on the progress.

She meant the world to me, my whole soul lit up the moment she entered the room.  I felt myself really falling for her personality, her smile, her laugh. I was very honored that we were able to share time together, it really meant something to me and I hope that it had meant a lot to her as well.  When she told me that she was moving cross country, I was heart-broken. I truly thought that she would be in my life forever and yet that was not the case at all.  She had been assigned to a job which would take her away from me and possibly to new countries and new adventures. I might never see her again and I felt that was almost too much for me to bear. We did keep in touch, and like I suspected, contact became less and less until it was almost gone completely. I went on with my life, found other people to spend my time with. Dated, and dated some wonderful people, but none really compared to her. I found she was on my mind, if only in the back of my mind as the gold standard to which anyone I met was compared against. It was definitely difficult to compare and my relationships always suffered as a consequence of it. Then one day, just last week my life changed forever.

They showed such detail and we did the same when explaining why this house was so perfect for us.

I think a good cry can help with your emotions and after it I usually feel better.

The camping trips, the trips to the lake, the playing in the yard and her love of chicken. The new pup we rescued after she was dumped she has sure helped me with the heartbreak I was feeling. She came to me at the right time. I think as you get older pets tend to mean more to you because they are your constant companion. When my kids were younger I was always on the go because they were very active in school. Now that they are all grown and I have retired I spend a lot more time at home. My dog became the animal who was with me all the time so her death made a huge impact on my life. Now with this new dog it is helping fill that hole left by the passing of my beloved dog.

So I reckon it's no wonder that I've been circling the drain for the past ten years trying to find a house I can afford. Less surprising still is what happened to me, personally, just yesterday. I went with my friend, Dean, to his new office in a very popular downtown district. We couldn't get there until about 8:30 p.m. in darkness, to drop off something he needed there for an early meeting the next morning. I didn't think much about arriving there after dark, since the office location is adjacent to a large public parking lot near many tourist attractions and restaurants. Dean had complained recently about homeless people hanging out on his office steps, but there didn't seem to be any solutions or even anyone to complain to about the problem. When we had dropped off the item and were backing out of the office driveway, there was a homeless guy sitting on the office steps, eating a boxed meal, with napkins spread out, as if he were picnicking there. Dean was upset and lowered the window, asking the dude to not leave his trash on the front steps. As we drove away, the homeless guy started running after us. He walked up to Dean's driver side window and threw a handful of rocks at us! The rocks sailed right past Dean's nose, but hit me hard on the hand and knee as I sat quietly in the passenger side seat. I shouted to Dean frantically, \"Get out of here!\"As we drove down the street, the homeless man continued to run after us, shouting obscenities and throwing more rocks at our car. Dean was able to snap a photo of the guy to report him to authorities. My leg and hand were bleeding by this point, and I urged Dean to get me home so I could apply bandages and antibiotics to the wounds. We debated reporting the incident to the police and Dean decided to call them the next day. I never suspected that the homeless crisis would \"hit me\" in such a literal and personal way.", "label": "recalled", "group": "KN29R33B"}

It was memorable because of how amazing the experience was being somewhere completely new doing an activity and viewing things in a new way that we hadn't experienced before. And we got to do it together. It barely cost us any money and we got to have a great experience. The most surprising part of the whole ordeal was that I wasn't scared to go out deep into the ocean. I felt healthy and good about myself and the fact that I accomplished something that for myself was a big feat even if other people might not see it as a big deal. I had been very nervous to do this. We viewed sea creatures such as a few fish, a giant crab, and other smaller little crabs. There wasn't very many fish which I was surprised about but the experience was still interesting. I saw the way the sea worked and all of its components that make it the ecosystem it is today. I also realized how hot the sun is down there because we both got very burnt on our backs from them being exposed to the sun for a few hours. The time went by faster than I can ever remember and it was my most memorable experience this year. We want to go back but have no idea when.

That thing really came out of nowhere too, and ran way faster than I imagined a bear could run. This was definitely not a small bear by any means. I had to slam on my breaks at the time so thankfully there was nobody behind me. I could see another car going the same direction that also stopped. When we eventually drove off we both locked eyes and kind of expressed the same level of astonishment to each other as we parted. It was all very surreal, and something I've never experienced before in this area. The bear ended up running into a larger forest on the other side of the road, but I can't imagine we have a large population of bears here despite this incident. The environment isn't too bad but I wonder how much food they would be able to find since most of this city is suburban. My only regret about that day is not having time to get my phone out for a picture. My wife didn't really believe me when I told her the story, and only relented after seeing how serious I was about the whole thing.

I remember meeting him that very first day and realizing how good I felt just being with him. It was as if a burden had been lifted from my shoulders. I suddenly felt free and relaxed, as if I had to worry about nothing in life ever again. He would be very supportive of my ideas and my decisions and would encourage me to go ahead and do what I wanted the most. He provided me with the background support that I had always needed to further to my plans but had felt so insecure before. He had a knack of making me laugh and feel good about myself and whatever was going on at that time. Aside from making me feel emotionally stable, safe, and secure, he also made me feel very secure financially. He made it look so easy, as if I would never have to worry about money ever again.

I was felt some pain in the armpits or breast that does not change with the monthly cycle. Also pitting or redness of the skin of the breast, similar to the surface of an orange. A rash around or on one of the nipples and discharge from a nipple, possibly containing blood. So I confirmed that I was diagnosed with breast cancer. The doctor will check the breasts for lumps and other symptoms. Several tests can help detect breast cancer as Mammogram, Ultrasound, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The main treatment are radiation therapy, chemotherapy, surgery, biological therapy, or targeted drug therapy, hormone therapy. But  I had chemo, surgery and radiation as treatment. If surgery is necessary, the type will depend on both the diagnosis and individual preference. A lumpectomy can help prevent the spread of the cancer. This may be an option if the tumor is small and easy to separate from its surrounding tissue.  A simple mastectomy involves removing the lobules, ducts, fatty tissue, nipple, areola, and some skin. In some types, a surgeon will also remove the lymph nodes and muscle in the chest wall. A person may undergo radiation therapy around a month after surgery. Radiation involves targeting the tumor with controlled doses of radiation that kill any remaining cancer cells. A doctor may prescribe cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs to kill cancer cells if there is a high risk of recurrence or spread. When a person has chemotherapy after surgery, doctors call it adjuvant chemotherapy. Sometimes, a doctor may choose to administer chemotherapy before surgery to shrink the tumor and make its removal easier. Doctors call this neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

I found that I was now passing other runners and with each runner I passed, I felt another surge of energy and motivation.   I found a challenging but sustainable pace and I felt pleased that I was able to finish strongly despite my slow start.   It was very emotional for me to be able to finish the race strong as I had felt so bad at the beginning of the race.

Once at the university, we were just so proud.  We saw many parents with their children on campus.  It was a little chaotic, but still well organized.  The upper classmates helped with the moving of the freshmen.  We tried to decorate her dorm room with the stuff that reminded her of home.  My daughter and her new roommate were happy to finally meet each other.  The whole day went by so fast.  When it was time to say goodbye, I tried to put on a happy face.  In the end, I could not help being emotional. What I remembered the most about that day is what my daughter did for us.  She had parting gifts for all of us.  She wrote each of us a letter.

He signaled for her to pull over and when she refused he rammed into her car and caused a pretty bad accident. Amber was just glad to see me because she was pretty shaken up.

As I was walking home, I noticed an old man sitting on a bench, he had dirty unkempt gray hair hidden by a rather old beanie. A dark tan coat dirtied by years of reliance, his face was pale with grime throughout. He had been on the bench for quite a while, I'd seen him around town before. As I walked closer, I could see tears rolling down his cheeks. He was crying, silently, of course. The look of utter misery in his face prompted me to inquire into why exactly he was crying. I had never asked someone why they were crying like this before, I didnt exactly know how to approach the man so I awkwardly shambled close to him and sat down.\"What's wrong sir? I noticed you were crying.\" I asked softly.\"I'm extremely sick, I went to the free clinic and I've found that I have no chance of life more than a few months. That's whats wrong, now if you'd leave me be, I'd appreciate it.\"He looked quite defeated in that moment, like nothing mattered in that moment. I decided the only real thing I could do was hand him my cup of coffee, as a small reminder of some good in the world.\"I can't offer much to your situation, but here you go, a fresh cup. Enjoy what little time you have left, man.\" These words probably sounded more offensive than anything, he silently took the cup and muttered a thanks.

As you know I've been staying with my parents and starting to save up money. This was because they told me they plan to move to Texas next year. That's fine, it gives me plenty of time to get caught up, get my finances in order and find a place to move to because I have no intention on moving to Texas with them. That's just too fa away from my current life and I'm not willing to just start over yet. Now here comes the part that just left me angry and jaded for a very long time. About 2 months ago they (and by they I mean my mother and my dad didn't stop her) decided to move the move date up to June 15th. That means my timeline for saving money went from having 8 months and magically dropped down to about a month and a half. Needless to say I was livid. I started to work as much overtime and stay up late hours doing additional work at home because I was in full panic mode and I couldn't afford to not be working around the clock. Now, we get to a few days before June 15th, she's rushing me to get packed and moved out so I disused moving in with one of my friends and he agreed. The 14th we move everything over there and I'm basically done. Still really mad but relieved to have the situation behind me. But it doesn't end there... in all that rushing and we're moving now and you have to go they neglected to tell me something. It turned out that the 15th was NOT when I had to leave. They ended up staying in the house for an entire extra month before they finally moved out and headed to Texas.  I was so mad when one of them said \"No son, we're still here\" I almost hung up the phone immediately. To this day I'm still salty about the whole thing but I've at least gotten over it for the most part. I do miss them a lot and have warmed up to calling them again.

We are all the same in terms of what we are trying to do in this world, no matter how you put it, the universe revolves around one basic thing. We are all living based on trying to understand our places and live our best lives. Isn't that funny that we do have freewill but we all are still doing the same thing.

I asked Siri, \"where can I donate blood?.\" A list of blood drives popped up, and I was happy to see there was one right up the street. I popped up out of bed, threw on my huaraches, pancho, and skinny jeans and hopped on my one wheel for the quick jaunt. I had never donated before, but I take good care of myself, so I wasn't surprised I passed the screening. Needles are scary, but I sucked it up for the good I was doing and this little deposit in the karma bank. I stood up to walk away, threw a shaka at the phlebotomist, and started one wheeling it home.

I finally knew what all those people I had thought were crazy were talking about when saying they had a job that wasn't a job. To me, my job was just so much better than any job I ever did. That's where the good part ends. My boss had never liked me. This was so extremely scary to me, because I had never done anything to my boss to make him act this way. He simply felt that I was performing so well that I would go after his position. I didn't care about all that, but what did he know. After eight wonderful months, I was let go. I will never forget this, as I view it as a great injustice. I don't think I'll ever have a job as good again.", "label": "imagined", "group": "E9TY34YY"}

I decided to take them to a nearby nature preserve where we could ride bikes and scooters.  We were having a lot of fun checking out the sites. My kids especially enjoyed going down hills. They fought a little vying to be first but those arguments were thankfully short lived.  At my request, we took a break to see some sights that I had never seen before; 2 old empty fountains, and a really cool Japanese style red bridge.  After playing around by the fountain, we walked over to the bridge.  I quickly noticed that the water below the bridge was completely green from algae. We went onto the bridge and I took a few pictures of the boys.  My younger son walked off the bridge and I took a solo pic of my older son. I was keeping an eye on my younger son but saw him go closer to the water. I called on him to stop.  I saw him get up on a rock right by the water's edge. I started going towards him telling him to stop but he went forward.I was running towards him as he fell in the water. I immediately jumped in to get him. I pulled him up quickly from the water. There were two older gentleman who must have witnessed this. They pulled us both out of the water. I checked my son who was freaked out but seemed ok. I was terrified because I had heard about recent reports of toxic algae blooms in nearby waterways.  I called the main number of the nature preserve and told them what happened. They were able to get someone to drive us back to our car, with the bicycles and scooters. We came home and showered.  I made some calls and got some assurances.

Monkey was my best friend and companion for 12 years.  She got me through the hardest times of my life, like when I went through a divorce and moved across the country to start my life over again.  Monkey was with me every day, through all of the tears, and she always made me feel better.   She was not eating, and acting very strange, so I took her to the vet.  After running some tests, the vet informed me that Monkey had cancer, and it had spread throughout her body.  The vet told me that I could spend $5,000. 00 to give her some  treatments, but she would still probably die within 6 months.  After thinking it over for 2 days, i decided not to prolong things and to have Monkey put to sleep, so she wouldn't be in pain anymore.  The morning I took her to the vet to have her put to sleep, was the saddest morning of my life.  I'm crying as I type this, so it's still very hard for me.  I stayed with her as the doctor gave her a shot to first put her to sleep, and then another shot to stop her heart.  She was in my arms when she went to sleep, which makes me feel better. I have to keep reminding myself that she's not in pain anymore, and I did the right thing.  I keep second guessing myself, and wondering if I should've just paid the 5 grand to have her with me a little bit longer. I think that's being selfish though, and I dont think Monkey would've wanted to go through each day in pain, that would get worse as time went on.  People have told me that it will get easier for me as time goes by, but some days it feels like the pain will never go away.  Some days I don't think about it a lot, and other days, like today, it feels like it just happened. I haven't gotten another cat yet, but I'm looking into it, and will probably get a kitten soon.  For me, pets are just as important as people, and they have a positive impact on everyones lives.   I feel better knowing that Monkey is in Heaven, and I will see her again someday.", "label": "recalled", "group": "YV4L0F6B"}

She checked herself into the hospital with stomach pains and while under observation she developed a brain bleed which killed her. She was 65. When I try to remember the day it happened, when my brothers and I went to the hospital, it feels like I'm remembering a dream. I was in shock and my brain was in full blown panic mode, not only for that day but for weeks. Something that I do remember is seeing my mom hooked up to a breathing machine. I had assumed at that point that she was alive and in some kind of coma so I was talking to her, telling her things that were going on in my life. Later a group of doctors gathered us in a room and they were relaying the string of events that led to this situation. I remember, thinking my mom was in a coma, asking about the prognosis. The doctor non-chalantly told us that even though our mom was breathing mechanically she was actually dead. He didn't elaborate and moved on with the rest of the information he had to give us. I remember the way he said it made me feel like I was stupid. However I was still in shock so I didn't have the wherewithal to ask any follow-up questions. I did some googling and found out that when brain death happens it's common for hospitals to keep the body hooked up to breathing machines so they can harvest the organs later. I wish the doctor had explained that part better. Up until this point in my life I had been fortunate that I had not lost anybody close to me. I recently had friends that had both lost parents and I tried to be as consoling as I could but now that it's happened to me I've realized that there's not a lot anybody can say that will make you feel better. That death affects you profoundly. In my case it took roughly a month before I felt like my life was regaining any kind of balance and my mom and I weren't particularly close in the last few years of her life.

The air bnb was great also as we all just got to relax in a nice house in the suburbs and play games and talk.

Luckily, we did not encounter any delays and we arrived in plenty of time.  I had booked a transfer from the airport to the Pier, and the bus driver gave us a tour on the way.  We passed the Space Needle which was awesome! Once at the Pier, we had to wait a bit to board.  When we got on board, we went directly to wait in line to eat.  It had been hours since we had any real food and we were not able to go to our rooms yet.  We walked around a bit and then finally went to our cabin.   Our vacation was finally starting! The days were filled with food, scenery, movies, casinos, shows and some land excursions.  Exploring different parts of the ship kept us very busy.   The most memorable part of the cruise was when we went into Glacier Bay - the scenery was breathtaking!  We saw the glacier break apart into the water a few times, once was a large break.

I was chosen from more than 300 students to travel to Maine and participate in a Biology research project. This trip is an all-expense paid trip during the semester and includes a $1000 dollar stipend. I was in disbelief when I was told by my mentor that I had been chosen. This is a very high honor for myself. I had some struggles at the beginning of my college education. I have worked extremely hard to get my grades and my attitude back to the top. The most important part of this event is the fact that the outcome of the experiment will be published. This is something that is of the utmost importance to anyone who writes. Being a published author/scientist is very important when I am applying for graduate school. This honor that I was chosen for will be at the end of this month. I am so very excited to travel to Maine as I have never traveled further north than North Carolina. I have just completed a written assignment that I will present to the audience on the first day of the project. The Biology chair at my university only had to make one correction to my 12 page paper. He stated I was the first student that received this honor where the paper didn't have to be re-written. This opportunity gives me the much-needed push to forge ahead with my application to graduate school. With the publication of the experiment on my Curriculum Vitae, I am almost assured an acceptance into graduate school. The $1000 dollar stipend/scholarship is a very welcome bonus as I am a starving student.  This opportunity will allow doors to open for me that would not have opened otherwise. I will be forever thankful to the committee that chose me for this project. I will also stop dwelling on my past mistakes as I have shown that I can overcome many challenges in my life. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity for myself. I will be certain to do the very best job when in Maine. I will give 100% of myself to this research.

One day when I went to the hospital to visit my mother, she was clearly very disoriented. She appeared to have no recognition of my presence and appeared to see something off to her right. She seemed alarmed and frightened. As her health declined, she showed a decline in memory and some personality changes from day to day, however this was the most disconnected I had ever seen her and the seeming fear was new. I could deal with her feisty attitudes, however seeing mom terrified was terribly upsetting.    I went to the nurses' station and they indicated that they would have the doctor come to her room. The doctor, upon her arrival, explained that my mother had experienced difficulty in falling asleep the night before, so they had given her a new medicine. She successfully slept all night and all day, but had awoken not long before my arrival. It seems that hallucinations were a side effect of the medicine. The doctor assured me that they would not give her that medicine again.    One reason that the moment stands out in my recent memory is that I tend to be very stoic. I seldom show emotion in public. I was so distressed over my mother's condition that I could not stop sobbing in front of the doctor. I was embarrassed by my lack of control, but was overwhelmed by seeing my mother appearing to suffer. My mother has since passed away.

It was the largest group I've ever gone camping with, and I was nervous about how it would go. Lucky for me, the two women who planned the trip were very thorough and considerate. The food was plentiful and delicious. There were more than enough tents to house everyone. The kayaks and paddle boards we rented were firmly secured and easily made the trip into the mountains. The two trucks we took also managed to cart us and our equipment without complaining. They're both old, so I had been worried about that.    I grew up in a pretty inactive family. We went camping a lot when I was little, but didn't actually do outdoor activities. Then my dad's back started to bother him, and we stopped camping. Last year I went camping again for the first time in over a decade and slept terribly. Thankfully, my body got over that during a week-long river rafting trip in April. It helps that I now have the right equipment and mindset to successfully sleep while camping.   This was my first time on both a kayak and a paddle board. I enjoyed both, but I loved the single-seat kayak. I want to buy one now. I live near a lake, but I don't have a reliable way to transport a kayak, so it'll have to wait for a bit. The reason I chose to journal about this trip was that it's a testament to the growth that I and my friends have made in the last couple of years. I used to be terrified of trying anything new, especially anything physical. I'm not afraid to test the limits of my body anymore. I know I can handle a lot more than I used to think I could, and I know that it's okay to not be great at something the first time you try it.

We have many people who write to us to either share their own experiences surrounding this mystery, which is known as the crystal skulls, or ask us questions.  About six months ago, a friend who also has her own crystal skulls asked me for advice and called me.  She felt it was time to create the next public conference where people could meet the most well known crystal skull teaches and investigators in the world and I said it sounded like a good idea. I have personally been invited to speak at various crystal skull conferences over the years as well as have helped to organize a few of these. Thus, my friend decided to create such a conference near Chicago and invited me to be one of the speakers.  This conference will take place later this current month. I was very thrilled and honored to be invited as I have been involved in investigating the crystal skulls for over 35 years and I have so much amazing information and insights to share about these mysterious objects.  However, it is in my nature to offer to help create such a conference as there are keys aspects  I have learned about how to incorporate in such an event that could enhance the experience of the attendees.  So the memorable event to  be shared in this essay is the phone call I had with my friend, who became the conference coordinator who rejected my participation to help and desired to do it on her own.  She explained that for her, in her past when she has worked with a group, things have not worked out well and wanted to make sure that the visions she had for the conference would be created.  This was of course a great disappointment for me and it took away my enthusiasm to be a part of the conference.  Over the months as the conference was being announced publicly I would offer to help and share it with others we know via emails and social media but in my heart, I knew this event would miss some key activities to really share about the crystal skulls.  I will just have to wait my time in the future, when we can put together the proper resources to create our own event which I believe will delight all those who attended and expand their knowledge about this mysterious objects.  For now, when the conference happens I will do the most memorable talk I can do as well as share with those who attend the special crystal skulls we personally have.", "label": "recalled", "group": "2O2OZEEQ"}

We both just talked as though nothing had ever happened. We talked as though we were no longer friends, but that we now have a history together. We talked like we knew each other very well. I don't know if that was a good thing or a bad thing, but I know that it was some kind of an evolution in our relationship. We now operate as two separate individuals, not nearly as close as before, but with a history that binds us together. Throughout the conversation, I kept trying to find some common ground. I desperately wanted to feel as though I were as close to her as I once was. She didn't reciprocate on that. She made a point to tell me that she still considers me a 'good friend' but never offered any new personal conversation that would support that idea. Instead, she made a point to ask me some very general questions, being careful not to get too personal or specific. She didn't ask anything specific, but I could tell that she cared how I was doing. That made if fell like there is hope that we can still be friends.", "label": "retold", "group": "V7ELZ7U8"}

It was a great time of year to go because it was just after winter and there weren't a lot of other tourists there yet.  The weather was a little bit chilly in the mornings and at night but we hiked all along Oak Creek which will definitely warm you up. We found a cool place to swim, too. The water was freezing but after exploring all around the rocks and getting all sweaty, it was really refreshing.  My friend was fascinated by everything and took a million pictures.  There are a ton of little trails to explore and we set up a base camp near the creek to come back to after checking things out on a bunch of them.  On the last night we had a little bit of a scare when we were lying in the tent and heard something walking around outside.  My sister stayed with my friend and I got to be the brave one to investigate with the flashlight.  It is really dark out there at night when there isn't much of a moon. I didn't dare go to far from the tent because I had no idea if there might be bears or something.  I was shining the light around and suddenly saw two glowing eyes.  I was about to freak out when the animal moo'd at me.  It was a cow!  There we were out there in what seemed like the wilderness and a domestic cow just ambled on into our campsite.  I went back into the tent to tell the others and the cow just kind of wandered off.

First we went to France, where I was immersed in the most gloriously romantic places I have ever seen in my life. It was here that I was shocked to find that the stereotypes I had always heard about France smelling foul and the French being rude were completely incorrect. I found the French to be polite and impossibly chic. They know how to live! I don't think anybody in France works; everyone just lounges at cafes enthralled in deep conversation over a glass of wine and great food. Needless to say, we were easily able to acclimate to that way of life. Highlights of France were trying escargot in a Parisian bistro, canoeing down a river in Bordeaux, and lounging on a beach in Marseille. Next, we moved on to Italy; Or shall I say EATaly! There, we engorged on the best food that the world has to offer, like pasta, pizza, bread, gelato, and more. When we weren't shoving food in our mouths, we were gawking at the finest art that has ever been created. It was a culture overload, and it was amazing. The best parts of Italy were seeing La Traviata at an exquisite opera house in Bologna, walking through ancient architectural marvels, and sipping prosecco on the gorgeous Amalfi Coast. This trip has transformed my perspective on life. Seeing new cultures has broadened my outlook in such a way that I have tried to incorporate European habits into my life. For example, I noticed that the French were very present and engaged with each other, not like us Americans who are always on our phones.

I learned a bit more about myself through writing about this experience. I learned that I have a good network of people around me.

Mom, Dad, my twin sister Hope, and I boarded the plane in NYC and flew down to Phoenix, where we switched to a flight to San Pedro Sula. We landed in the heat and humidity of Central America, and got a shuttle to our hotel on the beach. Our rooms were beautiful, on the eight floor, and we quickly unpacked, showered, and changed. It was now early afternoon, so we decided to grab a late lunch and decide what to do with the rest of the day. There was a cool-looking bar and restaurant right on the beach, so we walked down there and got a table. It was the tail-end of lunchtime, so the place wasn't too busy and we didn't have to wait for our table. Our waiter was pleasant and knowledgeable, and we ordered a couple different seafood dishes. I recall that I ordered fish tacos, Hope ordered a shrimp cocktail, and Mom and Dad ordered something different from either of us so we could share. A short while after getting our food (which was delicious), the bartender came over with four drinks. He told us they had been ordered by someone who had then left in a hurry and he was going to throw them out unless we wanted them. They were typical \"resort\" looking drinks, with umbrellas and fruit, and we gladly accepted them. About ten minutes after this, I began feeling a little queasy. I looked over at Hope, and she looked unhappy as well. I didn't say a word, just nodded, and looked at our parents. They didn't seem to be having a problem, but as I watched, my father suddenly coughed and turned red. \"I think we should get to our rooms right now,\" I said to him, and he nodded and took his wallet out. Mom was doing the best of us at the moment, but we were all rapidly feeling worse. She grabbed the waiter and gave him plenty of cash, and we all made our way to the hotel lobby. Waiting for the elevator seemed to take an eternity, but we finally got to the eighth floor and into our rooms, where we spent the rest of the night in our own miseries, throwing up and getting fitful sleep. Around 7 am, I suddenly realized I felt fine. I checked on everyone else, and they were rousing themselves, feeling okay as well. Whatever had been given to us seemed to run its course then disappeared completely.

It's funny because we can go months without a single fight, but as soon as one happens it hurts just like it used to when we fought daily. We had both had some drinks, like usual. We drank probably about 12 beers between the 2 of us and it was a Friday night, so Tommy decided to buy Fireball as well. He had been in a shitty stressed out mood and had worked a lot of hours, but the night started out okay. We listened to music and then were invited to a bonfire down the road at one of our neighbors. We have a toddler, but the night was warm and we were just gonna stop by for a minute. We got her bundled up, and she enjoyed walking in her stroller. At that time eveyrthing was fine. What started the fight was when Tommy finally came home. Tommy had a few more shots of his Fireball while we were at the neighbors, and I grew  tired of having to chase around my toddler. After all, it was getting late. So I went home with the baby...Tommy was supposed to be following me, but didn't get home for another 30 minutes. I was irritated and kinda bitchy, because he always does this crap to me. He works so hard and for so many hours, and then wants to spend time with everyone else when he is home. So I WAS being a bitch, and I was tired...and of course he completely goes off and gets defensive. He never sees my side of the story, and I never get to have any sort of negative feelings ...but whatever. I'm used to keeping my mouth shut. It wasn't until after the baby went to bed when we started pushing each other around a little bit.

I thought about how I raised her as a single parent and how everyone had something negative to say when it became clear that I would raise her on my own. It was like God was talking to that scared young woman that I was, telling her (me), \"It will all work out well for you and her.\" With all this in mind, I attended her graduation.

We were in a moving truck, but this one was a rental that none of us had ever used. We arrived about 45 minutes later, through the traffic and construction, to downtown Dallas, and all three of the truck docks were taken, nothing new there. If we didn't arrive half an hour before our load-in time, it was bound to happen, so I convinced a security guard to let us use a side-dock on a street they normally didn't use. The dock was adjacent to a street that was on an incline, and we had about 5 hours to unload everything, move it into place, clean it, and get out before people started pouring in. A few hours passed, so far so good. Then we got to the walls. Our company makes these pre-fab walls that we set-up, drill together and weigh-down with sandbags, and I had installed these a thousand times. My co-worker and I started rolling the cart loaded with about 1,500 lbs of walls to the liftgate, and we accounted for the slope, very cautious as usual. I was between the cart of walls and the street as my co-worker started to lower the liftgate, and as the liftgate reached the ground and I was about to roll the cart off, I felt the cart start to tip. The next thing I knew, everything was on top of me and I felt a sudden flash of pain and adrenaline. I thought I was dead. In what seemed like just a second, the cart tipped over on me, knocked me back, and was lifted off by two of my co-workers. The liftgate on the rental truck we decided to use for the evening had and extra little incline on the end, and paired with incline of the hill we decided to unload on, the extra little five inches of ramp sent the cart over the tipping point. I couldn't move my foot. I looked down and saw it laying unnaturally flat against the pavement and I later found out that the cart had dislocated my foot from my leg and broken two bones. It seemed like forever before the ambulance arrived. All I could think about was my girlfirend since we had a baby on the way and I was the only one working. How would we pay the bills? When the paramedics finally arrived, I was taken to the hospital, and ended up enduring the most excruatiating night of my life.

I freak out and immediately hopped in my car and sped over there. When I got to her she was in a great deal of pain and could not move without help. She said her entire chest area felt numb and was like being stabbed with a knife over and over. Once we got to the hospital the doctors immediately noticed her symptoms resembled that of a stroke. They did everything they could do and informed me that they would need to hold her for a number of days to run tests. Surprisingly, when the tests came back they showed that it wasn't a stroke, but a rotator cuff tear. Due to the fact that they mimick similar symptoms, rotator cuff tears are often labeled as strokes early on because of the sheer amount of pain the patient is in. Once we were given the news it was a remarkable relief. Even though my mother has been forced to undergo significant physical therapy over the last few months, so is finally getting close to 100%. A stroke at her age would have been extremely detrimental to her further health, so we are very thrilled that she was held at the hospital for extra time. I also remember thanking the doctor for being thorough at the time. I remember that he mentioned it could possibly be something aside from a stroke, but I simply disregarded it at the time. Now that mother is nearly back to full health we can resume playing golf again, which is great news for both of us. Her swing might not look the exact same as it used to, but at least we can get out and walk the courses together like we always have!", "label": "imagined", "group": "09LYTC5U"}

He ultimately passed away from a severe progressive case of colon cancer. While I raised him from a puppy, he was also my families dog, but I would say I was the most attached. We went on so many walks together whenever I had free time. He helped me to overcome my social anxiety and shyness by forcing me to go outside and talk to the people we met on our neighborhood walks. I met many current friends through this and became involved in my local school's community because of the connections I made. Luke was an energetic dog and loved his toys, always chewing on something, going through our garbages as a puppy, tearing up tissues, ravaging socks and shoes, anything he could chew up, he did. He developed an odd behavior as he got older, in which every time before he went to bed, he would run upstairs, and go into our linen closet. In this closet we kept all our childhood stuffed animals below the bottom shelf, and he would go up to this box of fluffy animals to kiss them good night. He particular was fond of a fluffy, white, blue eared rabbit. So on the day that the private care veterinarian arrived at our house, we gathered around the kitchen, where Luke was laying on his favorite comfortable red mat on the ground next to his favorite stuff animal bunny. Despite being quite ill, he still mustered up the strength to bark and run around the veterinarian, with his patented dark brown line of fur on his back standing up prominently. Eventually he settled down and became accustomed to the situation. Everyone said their goodbyes, and the veterinarian had me help her locate and stabilize a vein so she could administer the substance to have him pass away peacefully. She gave him the shot of the concoction and within 5 minutes, Luke had passed away silently, with his eyes still open, so we gently closed them. We had him cremated and he now sits in our family room in a small, wooden, decorated box urn next to a hand drawn picture from my sister.", "label": "recalled", "group": "6OXZWVUA"}

My wife and I are busy professionals, and we also have an 8 year old. Things have been going downhill, and luckily, we eventually recognized that if my wife and I did not take time to build connections in our relationship, things would just get worse. As a result, we decided to take a long road trip all the way to Canada (my home country). My wife and son like to travel to new places, and therefore, this seemed like the perfect choice. The trip didn't start off well, as my wife realized a day before the trip that her passport had expired. I was a little anxious about this, but we decided to go anyway. We'd figured she'd have alternative documentation to enter Canada, and at most we would be delayed at the border on our way back. We stopped by at Columbus for night before arriving at Niagara Falls on the US side the next day. We took a little time to experience that side of the Falls before reaching our hotel on the Canadian side. It was awesome. We had a bird-eyes view of the Falls, which were brightly and colorfully illuminated at night. The next day we spent all our time exploring as many activities as we could. We definitely enjoyed the up-close experience next to the Falls, and didn't mind getting soaking wet. The next day we drove to Toronto so that we could visit the CN tower, one of Canada's landmarks. There was a long line up, but the wait was well worth it. Our son definitely enjoyed watching the city from way high above. We ended our visit  with sampling of some of the finer chinese food, which of course we can't find in Kentucky. Driving back made me a little nervous because of my wife's expired passport. W ehanded it to the Border Patrol agent, who asked me a few questions, before stating that  my wife's passport was expired. We pleased ignorance and offered my wife's drivers license, which we knew was not considered an acceptable form of ID for re-entering. Delightfully, the agent said he didn't need anything else and just wanted to tell us of our expired passport so that we could fix it when we got home. What a nice way to end our trip.

Not saying I deserved anything of the sort, but a little bit of sunshine in my life would have been just the thing. Right on cue, I got a call a few weeks back from my brother in Oregon -- he was on vacation and wanted to come visit. Can you believe it? We've both been so busy over the last year we haven't gotten together at all. I spent way too much time tidying up the house in preparation for his visit, not to mention I went a little crazy with the sweets baking like I always do. What's a few pounds for a good time, anyway? He arrived two weeks ago on a rainy Friday afternoon with his niece at his side. I couldn't believe how much she's grown since we last saw each other! I had planned to take them out to the zoo (she loves animals like nothing else) but the rain forced me to make a change of plan. I broke out one of the old board games me and my brother used to war over as children, and we all set up shop near the living room window. Naturally, I went easy on them (and I would never admit to being beat!). We had great fun, and it was wonderful to see little reflections of our childhood selves in her -- even down to the big huffy pout when things didn't go her way. We all lost ourselves in the game so much we barely even touched the food. I'll have to pack some of it up and hand it out in the break room at work, unless I really want to balloon up. It was long after sundown by the time we gave our farewells, along with a promise to get together again next month. We all made some precious memories that day, and I can't wait to see my niece continue to grow!", "label": "imagined", "group": "4IELNM7L"}

The experience was fantastic as we went to visit several casinos and resort locations. We also visited Freemont Street which had a ton of attractions, people, and local events. A few days after we took a day trip to visit the Grand Canyon and go on a bus tour. The experience of that was unlike any other especially since I come from the suburbs of New Jersey. There was a ton of tourists there and besides the massive caverns and the canyon itself, I was floored by the beauty of the landscapes and colors of it all. After that day we went to a concert in one of the casinos to see a Michael Jackson impressionist and performances. We also attended a small magic show that cost practically nothing. We didn't gamble too much but we tried a little bit. Our hotel was nice too although nothing too fancy. We tried to spend our money wisely and carefully as even food costs were expensive.

My brother and my father had been drinking and were talking about politics, controversial things, and the nation in general. They began talking in ways that were really racist and upsetting. I made the stupid mistake of trying to reason with them and it ended really badly. They were saying overtly racist things while laughing about it, all the while saying they weren't racist. My dad said to me at one point \"I'm not racist, I even hire them\" and I just felt like my eyes rolled so hard that they might actually roll down my nasal passages, into my throat, down into my stomach, and sizzle there for a while. I got angry and I left the room. I slammed the door to my bedroom and accidentally broke the frame. My dad never noticed, and I called it half justice for the garbage he was spewing. I remember he said one thing about natural black hairstyles that made me sick. When I questioned if he knew why those hairstyles were important and useful to people he responded \"To keep the bugs out?\"It was a really frustrating and upsetting event.

We LOVE camping but there was something extra special about this trip- well, two things actually. The first one being that my brother was leaving a couple days later to move back to California for work. The second thing is that my uncle was going to come meet us at camp and stay for the day. I am from a small town in California called Paradise, that was decimated by wildfire last year. My uncle moved to Washington after the fire and I moved to Idaho ( I was not living in Paradise at the time of the fire though so thankfully I didn't lose my home or anything like that). Anyway, like I said my uncle was going to meet us at camp. I was so incredibly excited for this because I had not seen him in about 11 years! When we got to camp I did not have cell phone service so I was unsure as to whether or not he would actually make it (camp was a 1 and a half hour drive from his home). I was so excited to see him walking up that I nearly started to cry. I ran to him, barefoot through the woods, and gave him the biggest hug ever! There are no words to accurately describe that moment. It's like gaining a family member back in your life that you thought was gone forever. We hadn't seen each other in that long because I had moved to Reno, Nevada about 8 years prior and we just sort of lost touch over the years. My uncle is someone who I have always looked up to so seeing him was extra special. We sat by the lake, enjoyed lunch, and caught up on all the time we had missed. I am so very excited to have my uncle back in my life. While it was bittersweet because at the same time as that visit, I realized I was saying goodbye to my brother (he is now in California nearly 14 hours away from me in North Idaho), it was so fulfilling to see my uncle. You just never know where life will take you and who can unexpectedly come back into your life when you aren't anticipating it. I miss my brother since he moved, but I have my uncle back.

I was off dancing and watching the music while she was handing out information for the radio station and selling some records. Apparently there was a drunk guy who kept sitting on the table she was working, right on top of the records Nikki tried to ask him to move but he wasn\u2019t listening so she yelled at him, the guy turned around and slapped her in the face and ran off laughing. Nikki was absolutely beside herself so she came to find me and she pointed him out, I told her to go get security while I kept an eye on him and called the police.

We spent a long time filing a police report and winding down. Nikki didn\u2019t want to be in Chicago anymore at that point, she needed a break and was shaken up, so we made the hour and a half drive north to Milwaukee. It was starting to get later into the evening and I asked if she wanted to just relax and watch TV. She said she wanted to be around people but someplace bright and not at a bar. We went to a nice bright sushi restaurant and had dinner but after that I wasn\u2019t really sure where to take her, I usually hang out in dark places. On a whim I suggested we go to the Potawatomi casino thinking she wouldn\u2019t go for it as neither of us are big gamblers, but surprisingly Nikki was up for it and we went. We gave ourselves a $20 limit each and lost all that money disturbingly fast, I suppose that\u2019s how it usually goes.

We thought the family Down South was exaggerating the situation... that is, until we went down to see for ourselves. Shockingly, we soon learned, they were not stretching the truth in the least. Deena, always a husky if not somewhat fat person, had lost so much weight we could barely recognize her. Her house, always pristine and inviting, was now a veritable dump with stuff just thrown haphazardly everywhere. The saddest part was that she seemed oblivious to how all of this looked to other people. Months later we still have not figured out how to get through to Deena.  She has resisted every attempt to break through her wall and help her understand how dangerous and unhealthy her predicament is. The family Down South continues to monitor her as closely as possible while attempting to not appear like they are stalking her, which makes her defensive, angry and argumentative. Meanwhile, the rest of us are seeking professional advice because it has become increasingly certain that we cannot get through to her on our own. Sad, perplexing situation all around.", "label": "retold", "group": "R5A3DNGA"}

I had been working at the store for over a year now and I was doing great, I had gotten to the point that it was all second nature to me. I loved my job, interacting with customers has been great, my coworkers are the best, and I just really enjoy working here. I recently heard that a managerial job had opened up and they were hiring, I thought this is my chance. I've always wanted to be able to work my way up in a job especially one I enjoyed and that it would be amazing to get this job. I've been working so hard and trying my best so I really thought I had a shot but I over heard some of my coworkers talking and saying that Jenny, who has been here a little longer than me was probably going to get the job. I'll admit this hurt because I really wanted it and after hearing that I thought they are probably right. Jenny has been there longer and she does a good job and gets along well with our supervisors/bosses. I get along with them pretty well too just not to the point that Jenny does, but even though Jenny does her job well, I know I worked way harder, not to put Jenny down but I always work overtime and always volunteer for stuff. I had given up all hope of getting the job, I've had past experience in jobs that I've seen that usually the one the higher ups get along with or like the most usually got better treatment and jobs regardless of how well they worked before. I was really sad but one day my supervisor comes up to me and says \"Hey Sara, so we are looking in to hiring someone for the manager position and kind of looking at our options and we are considering you for the job.\" I couldn't believe it, I honestly thought with everything I wouldn't be considered. I say \"Thank you, that's great.\" She replies \"So you would be interested if we decided you would be a good fit.\" \"Definitely!' I state. She laughed and headed back to work. I was so excited maybe I would get the job. I had been so excited but then time passed and no updates on the manager position. I was working one shift and it was a rough one, we had a sale and people really took advantage of it, I was exhausted when I went to leave that day, I noticed my supervisor talking with Jenny and she seemed so excited. I knew that was it she had got the job and I was so upset. Then next day when I came, I was in bad mood knowing I had missed out on the job, then my supervisor walked up to me and said what I didn't think I would hear. \"Sara there you are, I have got a surprise for you. We talked it out and have decided we would like you to be our new manager.\" I was so shocked I didn't speak at first. \"Wait I thought Jenny got the position?\" \"No, not at all, you work so hard and always do great, we did consider Jenny but you always volunteer your time and customers love you, it only makes sense to make you manager.\" \"Thank you so much.\" I replied.

Right after that trip, my wife's parents sat us down to tell us about his illness. John was not the type to take things laying down. However, you could see the limitations he now had to endure were taking a toll on him. His wife, Martha, had to drive him since his coughing fits would come with times of difficulty breathing.

Twenty years later I am now sitting here wondering where the time has gone as I am in the process of retiring and beginning that next chapter of my life. I stayed in for many reasons but one of the biggest reasons were the promotions and opportunities afforded to me. Prior to the military most job positions I had lacked any ability to be promoted or opportunities for advancement. For those that had them the qualifications were vague, subjective, or I did not qualify due to things such as a college degree being required. In the military I found that everything was written so that things were defined and understood. Everyone had the ability to be promoted it was a question of if you wanted to be. What very few understood, though, was that you could go above and beyond just being promoted with the norm but hard work and knowledge of your job could be recognized by superiors with advanced promotion. This happened to me multiple times. When I went through the nursing program, on my last week of school, I had to study both for the nursing exam as well as my promotion exam. I was in the top 5% of the nursing class and I was the only individual to get a perfect score on the promotion board. I was promoted 2 years earlier than I was eligible to recognize me for my hard work. One year later I was promoted again one year earlier than I was eligible which, combined, pushed my rank 3 years ahead of fellow peers. This went on for my entire career. The hard work I put in went towards early promotions allowing me to achieve rank higher than peers. This led to higher pay raises and more income earned over time. It allowed me to attend education and training opportunities I would not of been able to otherwise. This allowed me to be able to afford materialist goods I desired and to pay for the family I currently share my life with each day. The promotions and income allowed us to have nicer homes, nicer cars, and more time off to spend with one another. Many complain that promotions, wealth, and education are all based on who you know and luck. I came from a household of poverty and am now considered upper middle class retired before age 40 with a masters in nursing. I am proof that hard work leads to those promotions and success in life.

Peanut was our bestfriend of 10 years. Then one day our daughter came home and told me that she had seen Peanut in a yard near her school. So we went there, and sure enough it was Peanut. He yelped and jumped up and down, he was so glad to see us. We knocked on the door of the mobile home. A man answered the door. The man there said he had dog for years. He told us to leave the property or he was going to call the police I said good, I hope you call them. When police arrived, one officer talked to us and the other talked to the man. I showed the officer pictures of Peanut on my phone, the ad I had posted in the lost and found in the local newspaper, and the flyers that I have printed and posted all over town. Both the officers talked among themselves. Then they talked to us. They said since the man does,nt have any proof of a vet bill, no pictures, no anything to prove otherwise, they said take your dog home and make sure he can't get loose again. I was happy with tears and my daughter was so happy, because the whole time Peanut was so excited to see us, it was obvious, he was our dog.", "label": "recalled", "group": "6KRVNE20"}

A lot of my family hadn't been on cruises before either so it was a new experience for most of us. We partied for days, literally, but it was so much fun. We did everything from gambling at the casino to dancing in the clubs when night time came around. Not to mention I think we all ate more food than we ever ate before. When all food is included (except for alcohol) it's hard not to stuff your face with any and everything that's being cooked on the ship. Another cool thing that a lot of us enjoyed was playing basketball on the upper deck by the swimming pool. I had no idea that I would actually be able to play a game of basketball and it would feel like I was back home on the playground. There was absolutely no movement at all on the court so there was no difference than playing on solid ground instead of a ship in the water. By the time it was time to go back home everyone in my family was disappointing because we were having so much fun. We got back to the port, went through customs, and proceeded to get into our cars. Everyone looked at each other in disappointment but agreed that we'd definitely do it all again.

But we were desperate, my wife's been sick but doing okay until her negative reaction to that chemotherapy. In that kind of bind, the offer to help with watching the dog since great. Sadie's a very friendly golden lab, I figured she wouldn't be much trouble for our neighbor Leslie to take care of and I'd give her some money to get the dog food while we were at the hospital. Well, it took a turn I wasn't expecting and I'm not sure what to do next. My wife is doing a bit better, but her time in the hospital has been tough on us both and she's not totally out of the woods. I go home almost every day, but I basically live at the hospital. And we still don't know many people in town who could help with the dog. But the neighbor is really becoming difficult and I'm afraid I need to get Sadie back from her right now and consider a new option. She's clearly taken to Sadie a bit too much and I think she might try to keep her once we get back. But this is our dog, we've had her since she was a puppy, she's a member of the family. We can't even imagine throwing away the last 10 years with her. She's like our daughter. But I can't just leave her with the neighbor any longer since I think the attachment she's formed is a bit too great. Last time I was home and I stopped over to see Sadie, Leslie had her dressed in a matching outfit to her. And there were pictures of the two of them up in the house. After speaking with another neighbor last week, I now realize that Leslie is widowed in the last two years and been on her own since. I think she might be lonely and Sadie has been great for her. But really, a bit too great. So I'm not sure what to do, but I'm certain leaving her there is no longer an option. I'm going to ask some people at the hospital if there are options for bringing her in with me or a kennel. Or maybe even a house sitter? I'm not sure about a house sitter because I'm not clear on how Leslie will respond to seeing someone else with Sadie. Quite a pickle we're in, but Sadie is part of the family and she's staying with us regardless, she can't become someone else's pet long term no matter how helpful it's been the last few months.", "label": "imagined", "group": "Y88TU8SV"}

I wouldn't call myself that, but my sister did a couple weeks ago when she called to catch up.  I'm not going to lie, it hurt because I knew it was true. I had only moved here a few months ago, I told her...but she laughed. She knew that was an excuse. This was ongoing behavior for me, and we both knew it.

I thought that maybe the prescription had changed in my glasses and this was causing my headaches. I told the nurse at the office about my headaches and she ran all of the regular tests and checked for glaucoma. My eyes were healthy and they didn't find anything that should be causing the headaches. As soon as the doctor came in to see me, he took one look at my misaligned eyes and told me that I could have surgery to get my eyes lined up properly. He spent the rest of the time giving me information about the surgery and then asked if I was interested. I told him that I was and his office referred me to an eye surgeon the next day. I visited the eye surgeon, and she told me that because of my severe eye turn, she wouldn't be able to completely line my eyes up, but that she could get them close enough that an ordinary person could not tell that they were turned in some. She was afraid that I would see double the rest of my life if she completely aligned them. Long story short, I went ahead and scheduled the eye surgery. After hearing about all the risks involved, I had some trepidation. The surgery went very well and the thing that surprised me the most when I woke up was that I was not seeing double at all. My vision was a little cloudy and I was groggy, but, my field of vision was so much broader. I looked into the mirror and saw that my eyes were truly aligned! This was wonderful news! Recovery went well. I basically rested and didn't do much of anything while my husband took care of the house and our girls. The only side effect of the surgery was sore eyes for a few weeks, but my vision kept improving as time went by. I am so happy that I made the decision to get my eyes fixed.

We had dinner scheduled at a local fine-dining restaurant for the whole family, over ten of us in all, many of whom had traveled from across country. My mother, sister, and her husband were staying with me and my girlfriend, and the larger extended family were staying either at hotels or my brother's house on the north side of the city. About 45 minutes before we were going to leave for dinner I noticed a fairly large storm headed our way on my phone weather app. I didn't think much of it, just that we might get some rain and thunder. I was glad to see the rain because the city could use it.  What we ended up receiving was a torrential downpour, 60 mile per hour gusts of wind, hail, strong lightning, and a power outage throughout much of our city. The storm blasted through the city in less than 1 hour but left in it's wake thousands of downed trees, power lines, and many flooded streets. Personally, at my house, it knocked out power, blew down a wall of planters where we had a herb garden planted, and damaged some branches on a tree in the front yard, but we were luckily spared any larger damage. After the storm had abated we decided to head to the restaurant, not knowing the extent of the damage the city had faced. Driving down to the restaurant we had to navigate downed tree branches, electrical lines, flooding, dead traffic lights, and emergency vehicles. When we made it to the restaurant and they were out of power as well, and wouldn't be able to open until power was restored, and nobody knew when that would happen. Fortunately, cell phone networks still worked, so we started to organize and decide on a new plan. My brother still had electricity up where he lives, so we ended up driving to my brother's house and ordering a bunch of pizza from Dominoes and chowing down on cheap pizza and just partying with the whole family and having a good time.

We went to King's Island. My son is five, but large for his age (big enough to go on every ride in the \"Kiddie\" part of the park), but he has a developmental disorder, with issues predominantly centered around attention and language.  This has given him some social delays as well - and so often in exciting places (like an amusement park) it can be tough to maintain his attention on something that I want him focused on.   Also, there are times when he doesn't have the language to communicate his needs or express what he's thinking about.   Despite this, he's adventurous and likes to try new things, so going to an amusement park is sort of \"up his alley\" but also a type of situation that can give me anxiety due to the language and attention challenges. This trip was amazing.  My son was completely excited and had the time of his life.  We had worked on the word \"brave\" and he continued to use this term to describe himself at the park.  He'd go up to one of the kiddie rides and express that he was going to be brave and then I'd watch him just rise to the moment.  I'll be honest, I'm getting emotional just remembering the look on his face when he was utterly terrified of a ride, wanted to be on it, and didn't want me to ride it with him.  He told me he was going to be \"Brave\" and the determination and maturity as he faced his fear, and handled it was amazing.   And beyond that, the pride he had when he got off that little ride fills my heart.  There were some language difficulties, when I was asking him about some of the adult rides, \"What do you think of that one?  That looks big! That looks scary.\"  He clearly misunderstood my intentions and got into a panic, becoming really scared and shouting \"I don't want to ride it!\"    He calmed down when my wife explained that she wasn't going to make him get on the big rides.   Although, honestly, he gave me a skeptical look as if to say, \"You won't Mom, but I dunno about Dad....\" He was amazing, and it was a fantastic experience this summer.

I also have a funny memory of buying a shirt, spending 20 minutes deliberating whether or not I should get another size, then running back downstairs during a break to switch it out for a smaller one (while my boyfriend begrudgingly followed behind me, but we laugh about it). My favorite part was discovering new songs that have become some of my favorites today, like \"Xanadu.\" I had no idea I would fall in love with so much more of their music! Listening to it live for the first time felt like magic was pulsing into my soul. I am often moved by music but this experience was truly something else.

Being sent to live in Egremount in West Cumbria had a number of challenges, not just for its white working class identity which served up a lot of prejudice for me; it was also the beginning of the sexual abuse that I had to endure as a child. My Auntie had two Sons and one Daughter. This was my home and where I lived with them, my cousins, my Auntie and my Uncles. From the age of seven up until the age of ten I was sexually abused by one of the boys on a weekly basis, apart from a three month period in each year. I was forced to act out sexual favours for him. He was eighteen at the time and the abuse would always happen in mine and my dad\u2019s room. This is mentioned for the reason of if I was reading this I may ask \u2018where was my dad when this was happening? Dads are supposed to protect you aren\u2019t they?\u2019 He lived in Ghana working and living with my Mum where he would spend nine months in Ghana and three months in England. As a black child, young adult who had no black friends, no black family members or black role models there has been a visible lack of \u2018group identity\u2019. My contact with blackness was watching Muhammad Ali win the heavy weight championship of the world, the Jackson Five singing ABC and the Brazilin footballer Pele being my school nickname given to me by my white peers. Having to live with experiencing sexual abuse has had a huge effect on me; anger, depression and anxiety have been emotions which were hard for me to live with but easy for me to relate to. Even so the sexual abuse had not affected the real sense of \u2018uniqueness\u2019 my situation gave me. It did not matter that there was a lack of blackness in my world to relate to, both subtle and overate messages every day gave negative, positive assurance of my sense of self, I felt black, it was certainly not the case of being proud of this fact after all I had been sexual abused as a child. Self-image has direct long term impact on self-esteem and is vital in helping a healthy development. When my cousin who sexual abused me told me \u2018if I spoke to anyone about the sexual abuse no one would believe me because I was an outsider, a brown bugger no one wanted\u2019 his words stopped me from saying anything to anyone.", "label": "imagined", "group": "0L7R8F8D"}

I didn't realize how annoying until we broke up and I didn't have to put up with it anymore.    He was obsessed with his dead wife.

He also had a 26 year old daughter that has the maturity of a 12 year old and was constantly calling and texting non stop with a constant barrage of problems and drama.  He catered to her every call and text, and when she knew we were going to go do something together (usually he pretended he was by himself), she would purposely call to ruin it.  She would call and be fake bawling, and I do mean over the top bawling, saying \"I miss mom!!!!\"  and wailing.  It would ruin him and it was like attending an event with a zombie after that because she messed with his head.   She was a theatre major, so I really doubt it was real crying, the mother died 4 years ago.   When she would come to town to visit, he wouldn't even tell me the date she was leaving, text me, see me, call me or even acknowledge my existence.  It was an absolute insult and ridiculous.    I deserve better treatment than that. He would also lie and be secretive about so many things big and small, I got to the point where I couldn't trust anything he was saying because I had know he was lying so many times before.

One of John's friends seemed to take a liking to Chris and was chatting her up outside on the patio.  She seemed interested in him. Pete noticed the interaction and started drinking a lot of bourbon, perhaps because he had hoped to have sex with Chris that night and saw that he had competition.

Pete had been distracted with something else and didn't notice until they had been gone for several minutes. When he figured out that Chris had left with another guy, Pete went kinda crazy. He started blaming our roommate John for bringing those strange guys to the house. Pete started yelling right in John's face, and John got very agitated.

My wife and daughter had never been to the Rocky Mountains either, so it was sure to be a treat. We stayed with my wife's cousin and were there primarily to visit my wife's aunt. She has very sick and moved from Chicago to Boulder in order to live a more comfortable life. The first full day were were in Colorado we were taken to the Rocky Mountain National Park. Unlike the typical park in a city setting, this was a huge, and I mean huge area, covering a vast majority of the Rocky Mountain range. My wife's aunt was able to come with, using her scooter, so it was nice spending our day with her also. She had only been to the lower portion of the park, so we were determined to get her to the top-most visitor's center in the park. After an hour and a half or so, we finally made it. We were able to buy some souvenirs and eat a nice lunch with my wife's cousin and aunt. It was a great lunch, and was the closest I had been to nature in a long, long time. After the long drive back, my wife, daughter, and I went white water rafting! None of us had done anything like that before, so it was quite exciting. My daughter and I sat in the front of the raft, with my wife sitting behind my daughter. No sooner had we left the shore, my wife fell in! She was \"rescued\" but soured for the rest of the ride. We kept her spirits up and we powered through nice category IV and category V rapids! She made it the rest of the way and although she was a trooper after having fallen in, she vowed never, ever, to do anything even close to resembling that again. After we finished, we were bused back to our start point, drove back to my wife's cousin's house and went to bed after a very long, exhausting, yet fulfilling day.", "label": "retold", "group": "NBCFN9AL"}

It has begun the previous day and the uncomfortable feeling just didn't go away.  At 3:30 AM, I drove from the San Gabriel Valley to the facility, about 15 miles away.  My friends still think I was nuts and my family agreed, saying that this apple did not fall far from its tree, seeing that my dad did the same thing when he had his heart attack at 65.  While at the emergency ward, I began to get suspicious and came up with this conclusion:  the more different doctors visit you in a two hour period, the more serious the condition.  For the next few hours, I was prodded, tested and sent to another hospital where two stents were inserted to make the \"widow maker\" work better (it was 90% blocked).  Within a few days, I was released. However, the world I knew for 61 years changed with those three days.  Probably the greatest challenge wasn't so much the junk food that consumed this average baby boomer so much as the time I had to take to make that work.  Seasoning food without salt takes creativity. Substituting fruits and whole wheat involves careful planning at a store.  If i eat out, I have to check the menu more carefully to eliminate anything with too much sodium, or with processed sugar.  In short, this new diet demands attentitveness, something I ignored when it came to health, but didn't when it came to work.  I'm not through though.  In a few weeks, I have to meet with a cardiac surgeon.  Yeah, bypass.  That means a few months recovery at a time where I don't think I have the strength or resources to fully get back on my feet.  But I have friends and family and my own tenacity.  I can prepare a salmon, I can rise up from however many bypasses they have to put in.", "label": "recalled", "group": "7CBYRACX"}

Things started out so well before they began to have a lot of disagreements around Sean's alcohol consumption. Around two years in it became absolutely unbearable for Sharon and she had to do something about it. After a large argument and much intervention, she ultimately told Sean that she needs to leave him if he did not quit drinking. She did not want to leave him but she was under the belief that this was the only thing that could get Sean to go back to his former self that she fell in love with. Initially, Sean took this terribly and told her if she really did not love him that she should just go then. She, reluctantly, left. Two days later Sean called her from a rehab center, saying that upon further reflection he knew Sharon was right and he decided to check himself in to rehab. Sharon agreed to support him through this and they stayed together while Sean learned to handle his problems. After about six months Sean got out of rehab and their relationship began to blossom again. It was exactly like it was when things started out and Sean and Sharon were the perfect couple together again. About a year ago now, Sean proposed to Sharon and seeing that he was a changed, true, and whole man again, Sharon agreed excitedly. After a lot of planning, they settled on the perfect wedding for them - a small wedding in a small venue with only close friends and family. It was truly the proudest moment of my life. It was wonderful to watch my sweet daughter get married to the man of her dreams and it was also clear to me that Sean's intentions were true and honest. A story that started out blissfully, turned into much pain, finally had a happy ending and I could not have been happier about all of it. It was a true joy and an absolutely wonderful event.

The doctor ordered a scan of my abdomen where I had been complaining of pain for several weeks, and some blood work done. Two weeks ago I received a phone call to come in again to go over those results. Thinking it was just something like an ulcer, or hernia, or something like that, I just assumed my doctor wanted to discuss a treatment, and to prescribe me some possible medications. When he entered the room at his office, he had a very serious look on his face, which came as no comfort to me. He then proceeded to inform me that I had a cancerous growth that was found on my liver. I was in shock, to say the least, and have spent the last couple of weeks since the diagnosis trying to wrap my head around it.  I was told it was serious, and was given three to five years on average to live. I was also told that almost no one beats liver cancer. I have yet to decide on what treatment recommendations to go with, and am preparing myself to discuss this further in the next week or so. My wife is also devastated, and so are our children. In the mean time, I've decided to keep a very positive attitude, as much as possible, with the determination that I plan to be one of the few that beat this disease.

I had been taking it for about a week or so when I started noticing some changes in my body. I was losing weight, and fast. I expected some differences in behavior the first few weeks due to the chemical changes happening but I was not expecting weight loss. I chalked it up to the medication and figured it was a minor side effect and continued taking my medicine as prescribed. After about three weeks of taking this medicine I looked like a normal girl.

I told her that I loved how I had looked and that it is the best medication because I felt so much better. The doctor immediately told me that this was not what was supposed to happen with my medicine. She immediately told me that I would no longer be getting that prescription, that losing that much weight in such a short time span was incredibly unhealthy and she would like to run blood work to make sure I was okay. Luckily the blood work came back just fine. I was a lucky patient. After going home, new medication in hand, I looked at myself in the mirror. I am the girl I used to be. I am no longer the \"fat\" friend. I realized that my anxiety and depression was caused by my lack of self confidence. I made a goal that day to work out and keep this weight off.

{"id": "31EUONYN2WPGEQO48VPPCLLYQNKVOD", "text": "I've been dealing with a chronic, \"incurable\" medical condition for around 16 years, but recently, I've discovered something that might be a potential cure. They say food is the best medicine, and I found, perhaps serendpitiously, a product at Costco that provided great relief from this medical condition, which can now be classified as parasitic infection according to my recent blood work results. It happened roughly 2 months ago, but I will describe in detail what the product is and why it helps my condition. Looking at it from a broader perspective, this event was magnificent and a relief, as it offers tremendous hope for the future, and for others that may have similar woes. Whilst browsing for cheeses in the cheese isle at costco, there was a particular brand that stood out to me. It said, \"New York Extra Sharp Cheddar Cheese\" on the package label. What is so special about New York extra sharp cheddar cheese, I thought. I've tried so many cheddar cheese brands before, but with little to no benefit. It turns out that this particular one uses annatto as a food coloring. In general food coloring is regarded as detrimental to one's health, but annatto is unique. It doubles both as a spice and a food coloring agent. The spice is mild and not usually detectable by our bodies. After eating this cheese, something special happened. The parasites that have been plaguing me for decades started imploding and there was a mass exodus that I do not wish to describe in detail, but it involved running to the bathroom 30-40 times in the span of 5 hours. But why? Why did this agent work when so many other expensive medical treatments and anti-parasitic medicines have failed in the past? In this case, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. All the individual components of the cheese are important. Annatto is an anti-parasitic agent according to the medical literature. It offers numerous benefits in terms of health and is a relatively common spice used in cooking. Combined with the minuscule amount of milk sugar in the cheese, often referred to as whey, the overall effect is synergistic.", "label": "recalled", "group": "WWRHUZT5"}

Although I hate speaking in front of people, I did go up to talk about what he meant to me. I did not mention how I felt about the other hangers-on who got up to talk, because that would have been very inappropriate for a funeral, but instead tried to draw the focus back to what a wonderful human being this man was.

The test involved sticking a needle into my stomach and retrieving fluid from the wound to diagnose the baby. The problem was that if I agreed to the test it would increase the chances of the baby actually having down syndrome.

I was very excited to know what effects it would have on my body, after the tea was ready I sat in my chair, and for a few minutes while I waited for it to cool a little, I thought about my life, and how crazy it is to do this to Conventional people like most people in the world. After a few minutes that my cold cooled, I drank it almost completely, while I could feel it, the effects were beginning to emerge on my body, and when I finished almost completely my tea, I had the best and craziest experience in my lifetime. I left my apartment and headed with the effects of mushrooms to a park, and I could see everything with sharpness and colors too bright, people looked different than I usually see them. There was happiness everywhere, then further steps I could see a tree with violet leaves was something incredible, everything was so colorfully beautiful. Without a doubt I could enjoy that experience to the fullest after this, I began to feel a little dizzy and uncoordinated it was there when I knew that I had to do something to stop the effect, unfortunately I had to say goodbye to that colorful and beautiful city and see again The somber city of always. I ate chocolate with a good glass of orange juice and the effects started to go down, but something unexpected happened when the effects were removed and it was that my eyes opened and I managed to see and understand the good things of the world, the good things of me .I understood at that moment that this was my true self, a happily crazy person who lived submerged in a world of complete happiness and total freedom. It should be clarified that before, when I was a little younger, I suffered a lot of contempt from my friends at school, this brought to my life what they read now, an even better person, freed from any external opinion other than mine. And without a doubt today I feel much better with myself than ever, I can feel comfortable with what I do, I am not afraid to do any madness. After this I can gladly experience this sensation so wildly, it was a great pleasure for me. Fin.", "label": "imagined", "group": "A5EV410J"}

Eventually, once I got to know a few locals, I was able relax and enjoy my time there. One young lady that I met was a tour guide on a local safari.  Her name was Julie and she was so lively and lovely. She was enthusiastic about showing us around and was very good at her job. I could feel the chemistry as we joked around together the entire day. At the end of the day, I didn't want to say goodbye. I knew I had  to take a risk and ask her for her number. The next day I texted her after we had gone out to lunch and asked if she was free to meet a small cafe. To my surprise, she agreed and actually seemed excited. We really hit it off and agreed to stay in touch after I returned to America. So, for the last few months we have been texting every day. We try to video chat or talk on the phone as much as possible. I am so thankful for this trip and the opportunity to get to know Julie. I really think she is the love of my life.

About six months ago my family of seven did the unthinkable: we moved more than 1,000 miles north to an area we didn't know much about. My dad took a very good job in a new area, and it made the most sense for our big family financially for him to accept. Even though that meant going to new schools and losing friends for my siblings and I, we knew our family needed our dad to take this job. The move itself was pretty crazy, since we needed five large moving trucks to haul our things. We had one truck that was nothing more than our beds and bed frames. Another truck seemingly held all of our clothes, which was very eye opening. We have a lot of clothes! After finally getting settled in however, we really began to love our new surroundings. Moving from the city to a more rural area was perfect for my brothers and sisters and I. We finally had room to play sports and do all sorts of activities outside. Growing up in a downtown situation made it hard for us to experience this type of freedom, and we relished in it right away. I know many of my old friends back home said it was crazy for such a big family to move like we did, but I don't mind the change.

Upon arrival at the trail head the weather was perfect and we set off gear in tow. Now I like to be overly prepared and have high aspirations when I do anything, so we had too much gear for the both of us and wanted to go much farther then we actually did. After the first 3 hours of of hiking we were spent. However I had originally wanted to get another 5 miles before camping. Along the way we crossed paths with group of people and they had suggested veering off trial to visit a waterfall. Adn it turns out we weren't that far. So we decided to drop our bags and scout it out. While off trail we witnessed one of the neatest things, a doe giving birth. At first we heard some strange sound, I never heard a deer holler but this one certainly was making some kind of noise. As we got a bit closer we spotted her lying down making some kind of racket. We thought it must be injured. Deer usually have ticks and fleas so we decided it best to leave it alone. and continue on to the waterfall. Once we spotted the waterfall we were underwhelmed to say the least. More like babbling brook and less like the idyllic waterfall flowing into a mountain pond. so we decided to head back to the gear. As we headed back we saw the same doe, this time wandering around thrashing and acting erratically we thought must really be injured. however it was just a distraction, moments later we saw the cutest tiny little deer stumble out of the bushes. The doe and baby deer set off less than a minute later. We think we saw its first steps, and in under a minute it was gracefully prancing and darting off.

I hear more gunshots in the distance, I hear other parents scrambling with their kids to safety in other camps.

I'd been to Saco a few times with some friends and I have always been yearning for another trip. We\u2019re all getting older, so it\u2019s tougher to organize a trip with everyone, but I was committed to going. It was the last thing I wanted to do on my bucket list and I was presented with the perfect time to go about 3 months ago when I had quit my job after being offered a much better paying job in a new city. I took the leap and took the trip to the river on my own in this free time I had. I was nervous since I would be alone, but even if I didn\u2019t make friends, I would be content floating on the river and relaxing in nature for 6 days. Much to my luck, when I got there, I almost instantly found a few people who were in the same situation I was and we bonded instantly. As we floated down the river, swapping stories and kicking back beers, our group grew larger and larger. It got to the point where we were floating in a big group of about a dozen people. We were from all walks of life and we would have never met or interacted in any other setting. Everyone had a unique life experience and we all enjoyed each other\u2019s company and stories. We would stay up all night talking about our lives, what led us here, what we hope the future brings, and shared some of our fondest memories from growing up. This group of people were amazing, and I am so happy I was able to meet them. The weather on the trip was perfect so I was able to relax with my new friends without having to worry about the conditions too much. As it turns out, a few of the people I met were from the city I was moving to, so I made sure to get their contact info. I even met a really cute girl who I made plans with meeting up with once I got to the city and settled in. This trip truly was life changing.", "label": "imagined", "group": "GUOIKD5A"}

I know it's silly to call a dog your best friend, but he's been through everything with me. I knew his time was limited, dogs only live to be around 10-15 years old, but it was still the most difficult day of my life. Weeks prior to losing him, I could tell he was going downhill. He wasn't as excited to eat anymore, he had trouble walking, he completely lost his eyesight. It was hard, watching him go through that. I didn't know if I should be the one to put him down, or hope that maybe he would pass peacefully in his sleep one night. As time went on, I could really see him begin to go downhill. I woke up one morning and found blood in his crate, knowing something was wrong I took him to the vet. They couldn't see any cuts on him, and explained that he may be bleeding from his anus. I asked if maybe he ate something sharp, and they said it was possible but to watch him and see if he continues to do it. So I watched him, and he bled every time he went to go potty. He began to throw up after every time he ate, he didn't know where he was half the time. At one point I picked him up and he bit me, not because I had hurt him, but because he was starting to lose his mind. We knew it was time to put him down, and I hysterics. How could I go to the vets office, and not come back with him? How could I be the one to take my best friend out of this world? How could I stand there for one second and him be there with me, and the next he's gone. The day he bit me was the day I called the vets office and made the appointment, after I hung up I just sat down and cried. That night and the following morning I considered canceling the appointment, but hours before we were supposed to go in it looked like he had a seizure. I held him the entire time to make sure he didn't hurt himself, and once he was done I made him comfortable until it was time. We brought him in, and they drugged him so he was out of it. I didn't leave his side the entire time, I wasn't going to leave him alone. He had been there for me my entire life, so I was going to be there for him.

He is incredibly smart and gives all tasks his all.  He is super friendly, and kind of Ferdinand in that he doesn't like using his size to hurt others.  He also is home schooled, because as a parent, I am worried about bullying and the other social factors that cause students to become sidetracked from their studies and lead to emotional problems.  In any event, when Sam began playing football, he began with a group of kids that already had been playing together for years and also went to school together and lived in the same neighborhood.  He had made some friends, but this core group of kids was hard to crack - especially since Sam had no previous football experience AND the coaches were all father's of this golden crew. Sam was having an especially tough practice, and was confused about the instruction of a particular play - and finally angry because on day 7 Sam didn't know what in the heck a touch back, left tackle was or the different rules that apply to offense and defense yet.  The coaches son said some incredibly hateful things to Sam behind his back, but loudly enough  so that Sam could hear.  He was crying and so upset when all of those kids laughed and picked on him all practice.  I briefly spoke to the coach who did NOTHING but say it was FOOTBALL and to toughen up.  I talked to Sam, and he decided to stay.  He seemed a little off that day, but worked hard and had all the plays figured out as he had studied up the night before.  When it came time to scrimmage the other 3rd and 4th grade team, they SHOULD have demolished them,  but since Sam was a left tackle and his job was to protect the punk that had been treating him like crap - he decided to literally, and VERY obviously step aside and allowed the 150 lb beast of a defensive linebacker attack the little jerk.  After taking a couple of hits, Nate, the snot nosed coach's son, started hollering at Sam to do his job.  Sam called a time out and very loudly said, \"I tell you what, Nate.  I'll make you a deal - you stop talking smack about me and treating me like dirt, and I will do my job.  Does it seem really smart to be mean to the one person protecting you from a monster sized kid with death in his eyes?  Do you think it makes sense to piss off someone twice your size?  So what do you think?  Are you ready to be nice, or do I need to keep leaving a hole?\"  The whole field was silent - and the kid was so red.  His mother gasped.  I was SO SO proud, of Sam - and then someone started clapping, and then everyone joined in.  He handled it like a champ - and since then - there have been no squabbles on that field!", "label": "retold", "group": "CAWUC75T"}

It was my first time working retail, or overnight, and I was nervous about it.  But I quickly got into the swing of things and felt I was a contributing member of the team.  However, in a cruel twist of fate, on my very first night I was informed by a teammate that the team had learned our overnight positions were being eliminated because the store was transitioning from a 24-hour store to one that closed around midnight.  We would be offered jobs during the day, but our specific overnight jobs were being eliminated.  I was sort of numb learning about this, mostly because I was simply trying to learn my brand-new job and couldn't really put into perspective what it meant to already be losing it.  But the rest of the team were really mad and discontent.  Some of them vowed to stay on, but most of them said they were going to leave the store entirely.  Either they weren't able to take a day job with the store (for whatever reason) or they were going to use the news as an excuse to quit the job because they were upset and didn't like the job anyway.  I decided that I'd wait and see how I felt.  I still had around two months of work left before the last night, so I decided I'd work for a month or so and then make my decision.  I shouldn't decide when I was still so brand new.  Anyway, after maybe 6 weeks I decided I didn't want to stay on.  I liked my coworkers and didn't mind the overnight work, but the day shifts would have different responsibilities and I didn't know many of the people who worked them and I just didn't feel that interested in staying on.  So I just focused on finishing up my remaining shifts.  During that time I felt I got quite close and comfortable with my coworkers.  It was a tight-knit, small group that worked in close quarters, so it was easy to get familiar with people.  On the last night I think we all felt it was bittersweet.  Most of us were leaving, and felt liberated by that fact.  But we were sad to see the last of each other.  We all laughed and joked during our final break together that we should stock the very last item as a team.  Then someone joked that the last person would drop it and we all laughed.  At the end of the night we met in the breakroom and said our final goodbyes.  It was poignant, for me at least.

I've been depressed and my anxiety is through the roof lately. I need to be able to put food on the table for my kids, and keep a roof over their heads. A few weeks ago I was searching online for what I could possibly do from home at least for something, anything. Any help at this point would be amazing. Extra groceries, phone bill, electric bill, I don't care, it all needs to be paid anyway. I found some sites that seemed like I could do surveys for some cash, but most paid in gift cards, and you seem to need weeks worth of points to be able to earn a gift card. Then I found Mechanical Turk. It's something Amazon controls, so I looked into it and decided to sign up. It was a few days for me to get my approval, and in which time I did some research to find out what kind of jobs I could expect. The answer to that, was a little bit of everything, and sometimes some seriously crazy stuff. I read stories of some of the crazy things people did. By the time I got my approval, I felt fairly ready to jump right in and hopefully start making some money. The first few days to a week were rough, there aren't many jobs available for a new worker, so I worked for literal pennies an hour. But it got my feet wet. After the first few weeks I started getting into the swing of things, and luckily I've been making some better money. This week alone I've made enough for groceries at least. Is it long tedious hours some days? Yep. But you know what? It doesn't matter, because this is only for the short term until I find something else, and at least my kids are being fed.

I didn't even know that there would be a party. After work when I arrived home at my apartment, I was surprised by my roommates and friends surrounded by party decorations, food and drinks. It was all because of that poem that I wrote- it was published in a fantastic literary magazine last week and I guess my friends wanted to congratulate me! I was so happy and grateful to see them all there to celebrate and it was such a nice thing to go to all that effort for me. I loved all of the snacks they had picked out, they were actually themed after famous poets! Of course they asked me to read my poem out loud. I was so embarrassed, but I gave it my best. Thankfully, everyone seemed to authentically enjoy it. I felt so grateful and proud about the whole thing. My friends are the best, I can't wait to do something nice like this for them too. Now I am just thinking about my next move in the poetry game. I think maybe I could do  big things if I take advantage of the momentum. I am really feeling inspired.

I went with my clients from work and also some coworkers. It was at a river about 3.5 hours away from where we live. It was a very memorable experience. I work at a halfway house for men being released from jail/prison with substance use issues, and it is privately ran by a church and there is another house under the same church for women, which is our sister house. I have never been white water rafting before but my girlfriend has and both of my parents have been. I have been wanting to do something fun like this for a while because it has been a while since I did something extraordinary. The car ride was long but worth it and the day started out nice and warm, but as soon as we got to the destination, the temperature dropped and clouds started rolling in. The destination was also northeast farther upstate. When we arrived, we all changed and checked in. We had 2 vans full, 1 for each house, and about 2-3 car fulls of people as well. Everyone put life vests on and either wet suits or wet shoes. We all headed out to the water after teams were made and we got into our assigned boats. Each boat had an instructor who taught us how to paddle and when, by his direction. It started to rain as soon as we got in the water and it was only about 50-55 degrees fahrenheit. I'm running out of time for this study but the rapids were extremely high and fast for the season. It was a crazy experience and I almost fell out of the raft a couple times, and some people who I know did fall out.

First it was just extra money that I had left over from birthday gifts and holiday gifts. When I got older and started working I added money from my paycheck that I didn't need to use at the time.

Fortunately, for the most part my job is stable enough that I was able rely on that money in order to pay for necessities in life. I also loved using that money for anything that my kids needed. It always felt so great to be able to use some extra money for the kids that didn't come out of my regular money and wouldn't affect my budget too much. The biggest reward of the whole thing, of course, was to see their smiling faces when I gave them a wonderful present that they had been so hopeful for. Then, three months ago, tragedy struck! For some odd reason my husband decided that he needed that money more than me and the kids. He just took half of the money out of my savings account without telling me or giving me any sort of reason! He's been completely evasive about the whole situation since it's happened and has never given me any sort of reasoning for doing that. It's upset me tremendously since I've lost so much money that I worked so hard to collect. Worse than that is that I can't buy my kids all of the things that they want and they completely deserve which depresses me since now I don't get to see their faces light up with joy when I do give them a present. Fortunately I am still working and generally money itself is not too much of a problem but this whole situation has been a giant drain on me and my life. It's just very frustrating and upsetting to think that someone who supposedly loved me so much and was raising our kids would just do this to us. I think about putting more money towards my savings account so I can rebuild what I had but then I'm not sure if I would have enough money to cover the regular bills and other daily necessities.

Besides the lack of HOA, we also didnt have to worry about pet fees, which was another thing neither of us were used to. Naturally, we had to celebrate this as well.

I spent far too much on decorations to get giant foil \"30\" balloons since you only turn thirty once and I wanted to go all out for my wife, and just before we left for the party we picked up the final, most important part of the party: the ice cream cake with a custom picture printed on the front. Now, my wife and her friends have had a long running inside joke with her college friends about a guy they were classmates with. This guy made YouTube videos back when they were in college that have become infamous among their friend group, and only one remains on YouTube to this day. I've seen the video a hundred times since it somehow always comes up and we watch it whenever enough of her friends from college get together and start riffing about the days they were in school together. So my genius self decided to screenshot a still from the video and get it printed on my wife's birthday cake as a surprise since the surprise birthday didn't quite work out. We went to the party and I made sure my wife didn't see the cake the entire time we were there. I did my best to get all the food prepared and set out and make sure everyone had drinks and my sister didn't feel left out or awkward, all the while waiting for the moment I could reveal the cake. Later into the evening, the moment finally felt right to bring the cake out but I wanted to get the video playing first just for that extra effect when I brought the cake out. I asked one of my wife's friends for help bringing up the video, who brought over a different friend who, I kid you not, said \"Yeah definitely, give me like 2 minutes\" and 30 seconds later, got my wife to bring up her classmate who made the YouTube videos. A few moments later, the video was up on the TV and my plan was set in motion. I hung back a bit as we watched the video so I could escape away unnoticed and prepare the cake with candles. When I brought the cake out after the video ended, we all sang happy birthday and as I set down the cake my wife began to howl with laughter. Everyone was in tears laughing at the cake and the picture on it of the video we had just watched moments ago. Even though I didn't pull off the surprise party, the surprise cake was just as sweet a victory.", "label": "recalled", "group": "SRZXCB7P"}

We were all dressed in black, and my anxiety was running a little high thinking about how I would be able to properly compose myself. I was worried about how I'd react when I saw my aunt and my cousins who had just lost the man they used to see every day. I couldn't stop thinking about them the most and how much pain this event had caused them. The first person I saw was my cousin and as soon as we met eyes I couldn't help but feel overwhelmed with grief for him. Seeing him made tears pour down my face and we had yet to even begin the ceremony. I panicked, thinking I really should have brought a whole box of tissues into the church with me. I spilled my heart out and told him how much I missed his dad and how I had been thinking about him, his sister and his mother. He cried, too, which is something I had never seen before in my whole life knowing him. Then I saw my aunt who was surrounded by family, receiving hugs and words of consolation. I just stood where I was, watching, but it all felt so surreal - it was like an out of body experience. She had been on my mind so much that finally seeing her in this moment of mourning felt so strange. And to see her be there, she had never seemed more courageous to me, to be able to face this moment no one ever even wanted to talk about. My uncle had not been well for years and she served as his caretaker the whole time, but always seemed so gracious to have each day with him that she did. It was a day of so many emotions - relief that my uncle would no longer be suffering in a body that no longer served him, but complete grief and selfishness in hopes that he would bear it for longer so we wouldn't have to say goodbye. It was a day I'll never forget, and a day I find myself constantly thinking over.", "label": "retold", "group": "HYBHO51J"}

I had reserved a camping site just in time, and for my arrival I was able to comfortably set up the campsite without much hassle. I took the time to immerse myself in the many sites and sounds of the park, and found seeing the various geysers including Old Faithful to be a highlight of a trip. Nevertheless, I still found time and interest in hiking in Upper Yellowstone, picking out Lamar Valley as the ideal location to traverse hikes or trails. My hike in Lamar Valley would occur one afternoon, on an eventful day where I had already seen wildlife already in person, including bison and deer. Naturally I would try to keep my distance away from the wildlife, knowing well enough the dangers and threats they may pose to me if provoked. This would however become difficult along the trail as I encountered a new animal stumbling near the trail. More specifically, an animal while familiar would be one that I have never imagined I would see up close before. Along the trail neared a very large bear, with brown fur. Despite having seen other kinds of bears before, I naturally froze once I quickly identified the species of the bear. Seeing the prominent hump on its back, that signifies the bear as a grizzly bear, invoked various thoughts in me regarding the power and speed a grizzly bear is capable of. More so, thoughts of how to handle a grizzly bear also came to mind, which included not making any quick and sudden movements and making my presence known. I would find some relief in realizing that despite being too close for my personal safety, the grizzly was more interested in other matters. Keeping my distance while the grizzly foraged around for food, I watched as it would eventually walk elsewhere. The tense moment would dissipate as it went out of sight, the only reminder of such an incident were the photographs I managed to take of the bear, and my first-hand experience. I would quickly afterwards finish up the hike, the rest of the day being tame in comparison to my encounter with the bear, although just as memorable. The event was a highlight of my trip, one that I was fortunate enough to experience, and one that reminds me of the beauty and danger of nature.", "label": "retold", "group": "JQJRYM7O"}

We were heading to Oregon to hike the Last Nevering Trail.  We had spent months planning for this and had brought all our supplies.  The trip was going to take about three weeks and we were going to be backpacking over 200 miles.  The trails were well developed but were totally removed from civilization.   We were so excited and looking forward to this trip!  However when we finally headed out we ran into a snag.  We were supposed to be parking our car at a safe place that is reserved for hikers with permits, which we had.  But we got a later start than intended and it was starting to get dark as we approached the trail head.  I don't know if there were road signs missing or what, but we just couldn't seem to find the parking area.  It was almost night time when we finally found it.  We weren't sure if we should even start the hike, but after all our planning we didn't know what else to do.  So we loaded up our gear and headed out.  We ended up hiking late into the night, using our headlamps to light the way..  It was not how we planned it but it ended up being totally serene and amazing.  The forest is so different at night compared to the daytime.  The moon was almost full and this made it even more exceptional.  We finally made camp around midnight, and all slept well.

He is such a sweet, caring guy who everyone loves so it wasn't very hard to get others to help me.We met one evening when Joe was working.  I kind of knew where I wanted to have the party already, if everyone else thought it was a good idea.  We all like to go to a local sports bar called Ike's.  They have sports on most of the time but they also have some local favorite bands we all enjoy.  Joe's birthday was on a Wednesday so we thought we should have it the Saturday before so he would really be surprised.  A friend of Joe's volunteered to keep him busy that Saturday.  That worked out great, giving the rest of us plenty of time to get everything set up in the back room at Ike's.  We decorated a little with some sports stuff and some black balloons.  Everyone showed up around 6 and milled around til we got the news they were on the way.  As they entered the bar, the bartender greeted them loudly enough so we knew it was time.  As they entered the room, Joe's parents were the first people he saw.  Behind him were about 20 others, all yelling \"Happy Birthday Joe!\", as loud as they could.  Everyone seemed to have such a good time and Joe was totally surprised.  At one point, the singer who was working that evening came in and sang Happy Birthday to Joe and we all joined in.  After the party, Joe's Mom came to me and told me she wanted to pay for everything.  She was thrilled about the party and happy to pay for it which was not expected but was very nice.

It was a lovely wedding\u2013 very unlike any wedding I\u2019ve yet been to, but a lot like the weddings in the movies (you know, like The Wedding Crashers\u2026 never understood why someone would *want* to go to a wedding they weren\u2019t invited to).  The ceremony was short and simple, though there were a lot of attendants, complete with flower girl and ring-bearer.  The bride had both her father and step-father give her away, one on each arm.  The Lutheran minister was kind of a jolly middle-aged woman.  The gentlemen were almost all in army dress uniforms.  From my cousin\u2019s face, you could not tell he was hit by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan just a few months ago.  He\u2019s still not walking correctly and never may, but the damage seems to mainly be concentrated in one leg. The wedding was in a part of the country where folks are not as stiff as Midwesterners or as unstructured as Northern Californians.  I\u2019ve been to Midwestern wedding receptions that tried to be like this reception, but the soul wasn\u2019t there so they always ended up being kind of lame with folks congregated in the parking lot to talk away from the DJ.  People at this wedding line-danced (and not just to country music) and they enjoyed it.  My usually introverted uncle is apparently a dancing fiend and led the bride in some traditional dances.  This essay is plagiarized.  The food was great and full of local specialties (including something we heard about on the Splendid table from their road trip foodies).  And, important in my book for any wedding, they served appetizers between the wedding and reception. You may recall that the groom\u2019s parents had said they refused to attend because he was not getting married by a priest.  Not only did they not show up, despite his being hit by a roadside bomb in service to our country, they did not allow any siblings to come.

Day in, Day out we used to see each other , spent time together, talk and share things about our life, but when the cupid striked him, I had no idea. One day when we were in cafeteria, he proposed me. He said that he fall in love the first time he saw me and from their on, he decided that he will marry me, and no one else. It was a love at first sight for him, but it wasn't for me. I couldn't think beyond friendship, because my parents will never approve of him, since he is from different religion. I could not say \"yes\" because i was not sure. I walked away from cafeteria and went straight home. I thought a lot the whole day. And the next day i decided to end this friendship, so i told him the truth. He went completely crazy denying my rejection to marry him. I got scared and started to stay far away from him. He was heart broken and disappointed. He tried to talking to me and calling me at home, but i ignored him. So later, he decided to contact my best friend and his boyfriends, since we hanged out together few times. He convinced them and then they try to convince me that he really loves me a lot and he wants to marry me but then i told them it's not possible, due to our differences, my parents will never accept him. Then they said, if he doesn't marry me, he will die and they confronted me and i refused to listen to them. Then my friend told me that i am lucky that i have someone, who loves me so dearly and deeply, wish  i had that. Her comment made me think and then i decided to talk to him. I also bought this in front of my parents and they clearly said no. After all this chaotic situation, i finally decided to marry him, but without my parents consent.

I was already on my way to him when he fell so I was able to grab him right away. We were both covered in disgusting green algae. Some good samaritans saw us and helped us out of the water.

It isn't always easy to keep a normal outlook though. There is no close history on cancer in the family that I know of.

He was hit by a drunk driver whose four wheel drive pickup smashed into the driver's side of my brother's small, Toyota Yaris, killing my brother instantly. My brother was only 20 years old, still studying at college and had only begun to live his life. My youngest brother was the baby of the family being the youngest of 5. He was the only brother so was especially cherished by his 4 older sisters. He was studious, giving, caring and tried to do the right thing at all times. He volunteered at the homeless shelter in his college town. He attended mass every week. He took time to keep in touch with out parents and with all of our sisters. My family is devastated. This is our first loss in our family and none of us are quite sure how to deal with the hurt. We are close, all live in the same town and have each other but that doesn't seem to assuage any of the hurt or loss in our hearts. My mother has turned to the church, talking to our priest, praying and attending functions. My father has turned inward, trying to heal himself. My sisters and I have tried to help our parents but as we are suffering as well it has been a botched job at best. My sisters and I can help each other though, lending a sympathetic ear at least. We are still muddling through this and I don't know that my family will ever completely get over the loss of our baby brother. My little brother was an avid outdoors person who loved to hike, canoe and camp. Because of this my sisters and I are thinking of creating a sort of memorial along one of his favorite hiking trails in our town. The trail has a program where you can plant a tree and/or pay for a bench along the trail which helps fund the trail. I want to do both, plant a tree which will shade the bench as it grows, with a plaque showing it was donated in my brother's name. I think this would be a wonderful way to memorialize my little brother as he loved being outside hiking while always having his old Pentax film camera along with him. As I write this I find I have made the decision, I will do this for sure, plant a tree for my brother and provide a place for weary hikers to sit in memorial to him.", "label": "imagined", "group": "G0CP0QND"}

It's hard to find a time to fit this into my schedule, but I settled on 7:30 PM in my apartment. I do various exercises, but one of the main ones is running in place.

This was very strange, since no one visits my apartment at this time, and I had no deliveries. So got up and looked through the peephole to see three old ladies standing outside. I didn't know what to think of this, so I opened my door curiously. The tallest of the old ladies stood in the middle and explained that she lives in the apartment below me, and she's concerned about the jumping around at about 8:00 because it shakes her ceiling. Someone else said that the three of them were friends, and they were going out for a walk, and would go to Kenya soon (not sure why that was mentioned). They said the floors were thin (I had thought they were solid--the floors of my previous apartment were very thin,) and everything in her apartment shakes, so I should exercise in the gym. I said sure, sorry about that, etc. I didn't mention how they slam the doors in the apartment below me after I've gone to bed, but it sounds like her complaint was bigger than mine. So now I'm trying to redesign my exercise routine without any jumping or running.

A struggle that made me stronger in the long run.  When I graduated from high school, I had no idea what to do with my life.  I took a job at a local diner frying up greasy food for obnoxious drunks and others, but the pay was poor and I was tired of living in my hometown.  I desired adventure.  I enlisted because someone told me that I could travel around the world and get paid good money and benefits without a college degree.  To make a long story short, the Army was no picnic.  I did my four years and decided to leave.  Don't get me wrong, I gained a lot in the military, but it didn't fit my personality.  I figured I'd take the money that I received for college and get that degree that I'd been avoiding.  Unfortunately, things didn't work out the way that I had hoped.  College wasn't for me either, so I dropped out after a series of failing grades and lack of interest in a major.  The college money from the military, as well as my savings,quickly ran out.  I ended up sleeping on the couches of friends and eventually, they got tired of me.  I got another greasy spoon job, but it didn't pay enough to afford rent, especially deposit and utilities.  I could have stayed at a cheap motel, but I figured I was better in the streets.  After being robbed a few times, and run off by cops, I decided to swallow my pride and go to a shelter.  The local city mission took me in, fed me a few times a day, and helped me find a better job.  Even though on the surface I was better, I was struggling with depression from my experiences and had a breakdown.  The shelter helped me to get some mental health treatment, and in six months I was ready to move into a small efficiency apartment.  I didn't have furniture, and I slept on a air mattress but it was mine and I could afford it.  In a few years, I had learned a trade, saved some money,  and moved to Florida a few months ago.

Once we got further into central Mexico, the scenery was really gorgeous. The air had cooled down, and the mountains were beautiful.

Several times, we even lived together as housemates which was fun and allowed us to be pretty close friends. About 18 months ago, having recently lived with my friend while job hunting, he somewhat suddenly stopped talking to me without much of an explanation. This was very difficult for me, especially because I didn't know why or what had happened to precipitate this falling out. It felt strange and undeserved and I couldn't really find a reason for it or a way to undo it. However, in the last several months, he has started writing and even talking to me again.

I knew that I wanted to adopt a dog from my city shelter, as I believe they engage in remarkable work taking care of the city's abandoned animals.  I left that day with my 7 year old female pitbull, and my life has not been the same since that day.   I truly believe that adopting my dog has made me a better, more self-less person.  I have had to make adjustments in my daily life in order to take care of her, but it's not a struggle or an inconvenience (well, maybe it is, but I haven't seen it that way).  Owning a pitbull has been an interesting social development. As we walk down the street, some folks will look at her with an obvious discomfort.  I have had people remark that they don't want to get to close because they don't \"want their face ripped off,\" or will ask me \"is that one of those mean fighting dogs?\"  Even though I've known about the stigma of owning a pitbull, it's still a little awkward and shocking to handle these interactions.  I always try to do the best I can in the fleeting passing moments to share that she's a kind animal.  That being said, there is an abundance of activity in my neighborhood, primarily of the construction and public utility variety.  For context, I live in an area of incredible heat and humidity.  I often am concerned for the workers and their conditions.  So imagine my surprise when, one day, I am walking my dog and the construction workers come over to pet her and share their water with her on one of the hottest days of the year.  It was a gesture that was so sweet and heartwarming.  It really made me appreciate human kind and the ability for people to share and care for others.  So often when we go on our walks, I do my best to stay out of people's way and give them the room they need to feel safe.  It was so nice to have a positive social interaction with my dog and the workers.  Now every day when we go on walks they call out to her and give her pets.", "label": "recalled", "group": "IWKZP39P"}

I was reluctant to go at first, because the idea of sharing a bodies of water with tons of young children and random people didn't sound so great to me. However, as we pulled up to the water park I found myself beginning to look forward to a day spent in the sun with the people I care about. We showed our tickets and walked into the park proper. It was pretty much what I expected, families milling about, groups of teenagers and couples. We got in line and began the long wait for the water slide. We didn't think much of passing on the more expensive 'Fast Pass' tickets, but as time dragged on we began to wonder if we hadn't made a mistake. It was a full 50 minutes before our turn came, with about five or six Fast Pass groups going before us in that time. Definitely going to consider the Fast Pass next time. We made the most of it, however, and grabbed some food and few cold drinks. I went with a beer, but my girlfriend and friend each got frozen margaritas. After finishing our food we opted against another wait in a long line, opting for the Lazy River instead. The Lazy River was a loop in the center of the water park. To could either diver right in or wait in line for someone to finish and leave their tube on the side. After a couple of rounds on that we were ready for the wave pool, a pool that generated artificial waves every so often. There was a dj, but he played mostly family-friendly, ages old, corny music. The Macarana might have been played more than once. We left soon after our time in the wave pool, as the park was due to close soon.

I was behind on bills as it was and I was counting on overtime for the next couple of months to catch up on what I had missed. In actuality I had spent more than I could afford on that vacation to Aruba but it was just something I had to do for my family. When your friends tell you that they are taking their whole families on a trip to Aruba and they want you to come, you don't pass that up. Those are memories that could last a lifetime. Anyway, I was trying to catch up on those bills and going through a ton of stress at work that carried over to home, I just couldn't help it. It was only a matter of time before it started to truly affect my work performance, I just didn't think it would happen so quickly. Juggling all my account while keeping the bosses happy was something that I was always able to do with minimal effort, I just think the amount of stress made me handle situations in ways I would never do and act in ways I should never act. It started when one of my biggest accounts called asking for follow up information on details regarding their last purchase. I just snapped, I told them they'd get it when they always got it and if it wasn't good enough then they should take their business elsewhere. Well they took that business elsewhere, right to my bosses and over my head. When my immediate supervisor confronted me about, I admittedly got defensive and told him to shove it, in so many words. Not my best decision. So that was 2 weeks ago. Since then everything had been going just fine, I applied myself harder than ever to make up for my bad decisions and told myself if I outworked everyone, everything would be okay. Well, when my second biggest account called asking to compare prices and look for ways to cut costs and my answer didn't suffice, that was the last straw. Since I had fixed all my mistakes and took care of everything I needed to, I felt like I hadn't done anything wrong. So when my boss came into my office with news that I had been let go it caught me off guard. I was not given a formal warning of any kind. I was shocked to be learning I wouldn't be getting severance pay and they would not even give me 2 weeks notice.

To be honest, the most important thing to be noted was the pleasant and sunny climate which took the enjoyment to the another level. All of a sudden, there formed a dark cloud and it started raining heavily. It made us exclaimed. The thing came to my mind was I should definitely revisit this beach again alongside my friends or family. The resort near the beach was elegant and it made us awestruck with its beautiful outlook. When speaking about the food there, it never disappointed us. The food was delicious there and made it us felt fantastic. Overall, it is a must visit beach along with your family and friends. There is a theme park located near the beach and it was way far better than other theme parks in the country. The rides are very enjoyable there.

All I kept thinking about was how thankful I was to have so many cousins around my age, but how costly gift giving was going to be during the holidays and birthdays. That said, I say the pain of gift giving doesn't outweigh the love and support a large base of cousins, nephews and nieces has to offer. I felt like I had all the love and support that day. Everyone had so many stories to share. My parents, uncles and aunts shared the most embarrassing and blackmail-worthy stories of our childhoods.  After they shared information about my first crush in high school, I just wanted to melt or explode. My cousin had to leave the room after my uncle showed us his old dance moves. After the oldies were done with us older kids, they turned on themselves and shared some hilarious photos with us.  It was an equally painful and loving experience for all.", "label": "imagined", "group": "QXCHX7J5"}

Remembering back to the day of this life changing event, I still remember and feel the sensations of that moment as it happened on that day. Memory has a way of staying vivid when something very powerful sets motion within your senses. Moments like this are never forgotten, as if the event took place recently, even though many years,perhaps decades have faded away. Time may fade away, but when you are responsible for changing the life of someone else for the better. Unlike time, this type of significance never fades away. To this day, I think about that moment when I helped that elderly man in the store, and what may have happened to him had I not been there, as if I was sent there by forces beyond my control to earn my role within humanity. I realize every day, that my life really did change from that moment, this which reflects the overall impact of my existence, and the value of it's meaning. I just hope that someday, when I am in a time of need, that some guardian angel may rescue me from whatever negative aspects which may abound me. If I had not been there in that store on that day, at that time, would this event be someone else's memory to reflect upon, or perhaps the opposite may hold true. These memories could have been dark and painful. For had this man died as a result of nobody there to save his life, this would have been an everlasting tragic event for others close to him. Funerals are hard to forget as well. Unfortunately, that is not the type of memory I want to hold onto. So, in the long run, I feel justified with an enriched focus upon my life focus. I truly feel as though I have earned significant credit toward my worthiness as a human being on this plane of existence.", "label": "retold", "group": "4WZM0J6U"}

He had never been to Europe, and had not been on a plane since he was in the Korean War , and was shipped stateside after being shot in the knee. My Dad lost his Mum when he was just about to leave for Korea, and wanted to meet some of her side of the family in Cork, Ireland. The five of us siblings arranged all of the airbnbs, the transportation, flights and the itinerary for him. The highlight was to be meeting his Mum's sisters relatives, all still in Cork. The country is beautiful, with winding roads, villages, and brilliant green farmland. When we got to a little village outside of Cork, we met Norma, who was Dad's great grand neice. She told us we could spend the four days with her, and she treated us like she had known us all our life. Great home cooking, with eggs from her hens, bacon from her pigs, and vegetables from her garden. She had pictures of my Dad's Mum at different stages of her life, from infancy to when she left for the states in 1925. WE met lots of cousins, aunts, uncles, greats, all of them making us feel right at home. WE spent a lot of time just walking the countryside, as there were a lot of great paths to explore. My Dad still at the age of 88, walks six miles a day, and he loved walking through all the fields and lanes. My Dad's Irish family is very musical, and they had one night where they invited family and neighbors over for a sing along of familiar and unfamiliar Irish fork songs. One night we went to a local pub and learned firsthand what hearty drinkers our relatives were, Tons of stories were told, lots of laughing and quite a bit of cursing too. My Dad was overcome at times with all of it. Taking it all in was both fun and exhausting for him, but he was totally in love with Ireland and his family that lives there. My brothers, always a bit rowdy, had almost too much fun, but it was so great to just enjoy all this family had to offer us. Our plan is to take him back every year that he is still healthy enough to go. We already have about six of the Irish clan coming over for holiday in October.

My uncle put me in contact with the professor, and said that he was very influential in the school, and that his mentorship and rotating with him would improve my chances of an acceptance. Early that morning, my uncle gave me his e-mail address, and I wrote him an e-mail expressing my interest in shadowing him and gaining his insight. A few minutes later, he e-mailed me back, and told me to meet him at the school that day. This threw me off guard, as I wasn't expecting even an e-mail from him that day, much less to drive to the medical school and meet with him. I quickly put on a pair of chinos, and a collared shirt (which was wrinkled because I didn't have anything ironed), and drove to the medical school to meet with him. It took me about twenty minutes to get there, and about another 10 to wait in front of the front desk. It was awkward explaining my situation to the receptionist out front, since I was neither a medical student nor a patient, but just a desperate individual trying to get into medical school. His assistant eventually called me in, and he walked me over to a conference room where we went through my application. I initially didn't know what to expect from the conversation, or what he would ask of me. My grades weren't the best, but I had a relatively MCAT score that would make me competitive for most schools. I was shocked by how nice he was, and what length he was going to for a person that he had never met. He told me that I would be competitive for his school, as well as a number of other schools. He told me that I needed to finish the rest of my application ASAP however, which I kind of already knew to begin with. However, hearing it from him gave me a sense of urgency, so I ended up being determined to finish it. This conversation continued for over an hour, as we went through things I could do to improve my application. Overall, I was really impressed how giving he was. I can't say that I've ever encountered someone so willing to help out a total stranger. This confirmed that this school was my top choice, and it was my mission to become accepted there.", "label": "retold", "group": "AX6Z0CPE"}

Most people who know me already know that Girl Scouts have been a tradition in my family dating back to my childhood.

I know over Christmas she sold more boxes of cookies than any Girl Scout has ever sold in the history of her troop. So it's not like her making rank was a huge surprise to us, but that doesn't make it any less of an honor. In addition the troop also named me an official Scout Mom. I was thrilled with this distinction for two reasons. First, it's exactly the same title my mom had when I was a young Scout. And secondly, I get to plan more activities for the troop going forward. I can't wait for our camping trip coming up where I will act as a chaperone. I know my daughter is very excited that I will be to share in this experience with her. In all there were 12 other girls who were recognized alongside my daughter, including three of her very best friends. I couldn't be happier with how grown up and mature she's been since we signed her up.

It was around 2am when I started hearing some really loud, drunken laughing coming from down the road. After a little bit, I saw a group of 6 rather large men stumbling down the road, walking towards me. The group definitely noticed me, because I saw one of them point right at me as they got closer, their laughter kind of quieting down and being replaced by some angry shouting. Our work site was completely blocking their path and they didn't seem too happy about it. As they got closer, I got nervous. I quietly signaled to some more of the crew to come over and back me up in case things got messy. As they got closer, I began to fear for the worst. It is not easy to reason with drunks, and these guys were big guys. They could easily beat me up if they wanted to. For whatever reason, once they were about 15 feet away, they stopped in their tracks, kind of stood there for a bit looking puzzled. We locked eyes.

I thought about just leaving it there because I thought maybe someone would come back looking for their phone but my husband suggested I pick it up and bring it home and then report it to the department or the phone company if we could get it powered up and try to have it returned.  Well, we took it home and I put it into a drawer and decided I would get back to it as soon as I could because I just didn't have any time to fiddle with it that day. A few weeks had actually went by and I had forgotten all about it. I was looking for some tape to wrap a present and I checked the drawer and noticed the phone was there. I grabbed the tape next to the phone and finished up my wrapping but I went back to the phone and decided I would plug it in to see if it would power up. I managed to get it some power but I could not get past the initial power up lock phase so I had no idea who this belonged to or where to even bring it. Well, we only have 1 at&t store in our town so I figured I would just bring it to them and see if the phone was one of theirs. Turns out, it actually was one of their phones and the customer who owned it was looking for it. I left my name and my phone number and I obviously left the phone there and I went about my day knowing I had done a good deed. Well, two days later I actually get a call from an employee at the at&t store here and they tell me that this elderly woman was incredibly grateful because she had pictures on the phone of her late husband and the fact that the phone was returned had brought tears to her eyes because her phone was the only place that had those photos. Words could not describe the joy that I had when I had found out that the phone had found its home. I find it so bizarre that I was out in the middle of nowhere and I just happened to stumble upon this phone just lying there. I guess sometimes things just kind of happen for a reason and I am glad that things turned out great.", "label": "recalled", "group": "0AQW9LCX"}

We set off with only a rough destination in mind, and intending to go or do whatever caught our eye over the long drive of about a week.  We stopped in many cool little towns along the way.  There were really great old antique shops all over and I loved looking through the old memorabilia.  Along the route, we were passing through Vermont, and off the side of the road we saw a beautiful grassy mountain with a waterfall cascading down the side.  We thought it looked so cool, we parked and decided to hike up the mountain side a bit.  It was an easy climb, but long and tiring.  We stayed as close to the waterfall as we could as we went up.  We ended up climbing all the way to the top, and got an amazing view.  On the way back down we took a different route, and not far from the top, found a glistening pool where the waterfall cascaded, and then continued out the other side.  It was perfect for taking a refreshing dip, and we did!  It was ice cold, but really awesome.  The rest of the trip was great.  We went into little towns and ate amazing seafood.  I never ate so much lobster and so many bowls of chowder in my life!  It was really amazing, and there were many memorable spots.  We even crossed the border into Canada and drove a ways up the coast, which was really rugged and beautiful.  We visited a national park in Canada and spent one night there.   We saw many beautiful spots, but that one dip on the mountainside in the ice cold spring water was the coolest part, and a great memory.", "label": "recalled", "group": "2019XD2W"}

Typically vape e liquid consists of vegetable glycerin, propylene glycol, nicotine and, flavoring. So, i easily buy my propylene glycol (PG) and vegetable glycerin (VG) from amazon for almost dirt cheap. These two bottles will cost you about 15 dollars. Then, you will have to buy some nicotine and flavoring from a seperate website for about 10 dollars each. With these four bottles you are pretty much set for the whole year to make as much juice as you want. And this is why there are so many vape shops popping up sound your city. It's because anyone can slap a label on to a bottle and call it their own. Theres hundreds of thousands of different brands out there and a ton of flavors. Also, you can find the recipes for your favorite blend/brand online and make a clone version of your favorite juice. So, i've been doing this for a about a year or so now and it has saved me so much money. I used to buy 20 dollar bottles every other day. But now i make my own. I don't see why i haven't thought of this earlier. I should have put two and two together when i \"vaping\" started to be a popular way to quit cigarettes. Then all the vape stores popped up- putting their own labels on a bottle that will cost you around 1 dollar to make yet they will charge you 20 dollars in their store. it's ridiculous.", "label": "retold", "group": "MFMN9U2L"}

The leader made a brief statement about how far I had come in my recovery / journey, how proud she was of me, and how I had touched and affected her life. Once she finished making her speech, she introduced me, as well as presented me with my two year token and a very beautiful cake. Afterwards, my sponsor surprised me by making an appearance. Initially, she had told me that she would be unable to attend, which made me very disappointed because she was and is such an important part of my sobriety and recovery. My sponsor came to the front of the room and made a speech about me and my recovery, which made me cry because it was very emotional. After this, everyone in the room had cake and many of them came up to me individually to congratulate me and praise my success in recovery. Many of the participants of the meeting brought me little gifts and keepsakes, which made me feel very special. One of the gifts I received was a little box that had my sobriety / clean date engraved on it, as well as a very special quote that I find inspiration in. \"For where your treasure is there your heart will be also\". My sponsor gave me a journal that had an inscription inside the front cover from her along with my sobriety / clean date. This was a very memorable event because I have worked very hard to overcome a great deal of vices in my life, including addiction and the underlying conditions and issues that have had an impact on my addiction.

Fortunately, a doctor was available, though she wasn't an ob-gyn. The baby was coming so fast, there was no time for an epidural, so I couldn't have any pain meds. Also fortunately, my baby, Charles, was healthy and continues to do well a week later. I wish I could say the same for myself. The pain usually goes away after delivery, but that didn't happen.

We had a lot of fun throughout the whole time including spending time at the local lake for my mom's 70th birthday. This resulted in my kids playing some mini golf, fishing, and paddle boating all day long in the hot summer sun. We had water balloon fights and went out for ice cream and visited the specialty vintage toy and horror shop. My kids loved all of this and I loved all of this. There were so many other things that sparked a lot of joy during this visit. However, there was one thing we did on two different nights that brought me the most overwhelming positive emotion. My mom grabbed an old mayo jar in the evening one evening and my parents, my wife, me, and all 4 of my kids ran around at dusk in their big yard on the edge of the forest and caught fireflies until we couldn't see anything anymore (no street lights out there). Over the course of this, there were so many laughs and amazingly funny screams from the smallest kids when bugs landed on them. We saw bats flying around in the last sliver of daylight as well which sparked even more excitement. I felt like a kid again and loved being outside with everyone. It helped me hold onto my youth a little bit longer and made me appreciate my family and my parents even more.", "label": "recalled", "group": "EYS5P9QH"}

I usually take my kids on one vacation every year, but I never would have dreamed of going to a place like Europe with them when they were younger. Now that they're a little older, I thought I would try to make it happen. We were really excited when we got on the plane two weeks ago, but the trip wasn't nearly long enough. We stayed for 10 days. The children have Irish ancestry from their father's side of the family, so they had a blast in Dublin. I wanted to go to Tenerife, Spain, and I think that the children had an even better time there.  Our favorite place we visited was a beach in Italy that sat on the Mediterranean. The children had never before seen a beach that had sea glass instead of sand. They spent hours just picking up sea glass and looking at it. The weather was absolutely perfect, but it was not warm enough to actually swim. We shared so many amazing memories with one another on the trip back home over the Atlantic. I know this was a trip of a lifetime, but I would love to be able to go back. My children will be thinking about this trip for the rest of their lives.

I think what made this so incredibly difficult for my daughter was that she never got to say goodbye. Her last words were so long ago that she really couldn't recall them. Try as she might, she couldn't bring to mind pleasant or happy memories of him. It really has made her think about how he decided to leave. He has made her realize that the only way she could get over it is to forgive him and find a new path in life that invokes strength and love. His passing in life, sadly, has affected us more than his life ever did. We always tried to anticipate a day when he would show up.

So I went to a tax accountant in early 2019. It turned out that I owed about 6k in back taxes for the previous four years.

I say joyous because we did not think that he was going to get  to walk across stage due to some trouble that he had gotten into earlier in the year that landed him out of physical school and having to finish his senior year online.  I love this kid more than I can express.  He reminds me so much of myself when I was his age and my only hope is that he pulls through this and gets his life together.  His sister was always brilliant.  She was always in advanced classes and graduated 6th in her class all while performing in drama club and dancing on the high school dance team.  She graduated high school and went on to pursue her college degree at Purdue, largely on scholarships.  She starts her senior year this year and has had somehow found the perfect balance of partying and studying.  She has maintained an \"A\" average and can party harder than I ever could.  Very proud of her.  I think somehow my nephew feels that he could never measure up to his older sister but nobody expected him to.  She is a freak of nature and we only wanted him to do what he was capable of.  So when my brother called to tell me that he had been kicked out of school and could not graduate with his class, my heart broke.  I went through that spell when I was in high school as did my brother but we both pulled it together in the end.  I had given up hope in seeing him graduate but at the very last minute, they called and told him that since he had finished all of his online studies, he could walk across the stage with his class.  I immediately started crying when he walked out, ever so casually.  He looked up into the stands and gave me a wave and that beautiful smile of his.  My heart beamed with pride as I sat and waited for his name to be called.  3 months later and he has not really changed.  I am still hopeful that he will come to his senses and find his way in life.  I had a son when I was 18 years old and had given him up for adoption.  My nephew was born 6 years later and I think this is the main reason that I have always felt so close to him.  And the main reason why my heart breaks when he does stupid stuff that he knows he should not do.  Still, I have hope that like the rest of us, he will wake up and realize that he can do better and will go on to lead a successful and productive life.", "label": "recalled", "group": "XQ5V318T"}

It was very hard to see her like this because she had always been a pretty level headed woman and she was not talking nonsense most of the time, she did know who I was, however, and usually had a big smile on her face when she saw me. This past Spring, I had received a call from my cousin that I might want to go visit her that day because she seemed to be declining quickly. It was a Sunday afternoon, my baby was napping and we were all being a bit lazy, but I got ready and drove down to the nursing home about 25 minutes away. When I got there, she seemed alert and awake and she knew who I was. She was so skinny because she hadn't eaten in a long time. I noticed she was having problems swallowing whatever was in her mouth and she was very thirsty. I would give her some water and she would try to spit out whatever was getting stuck in her throat because she really couldn't swallow anymore. She kept asking for more water which I helped her with and I kept wiping her mouth to try and get her throat and mouth clear of the gunk. I stayed for almost 2 hours and had to leave. One thing that will always stick out in my mind about that visit was, even though she was going through all this, she had enough energy to lift up my hand and give it a kiss, I know that moment will always stick in my mind. Later that night, I received another call from my cousin saying I really should go down there again because her oxygen wasn't good and she could go at anytime. I drove back down to the nursing home and when I walked in the room, my family was there, their eyes all wet and red from crying. I looked over at my Grandma and she was no longer aware, she wasn't in a coma but she was looking up, with an oxygen mask on, taking deep breaths. My family and I stayed for a long time, talking, telling stories and laughing because my family likes to laugh in times like these but we were all a mess seeing her like this. Finally, my cousin and I noticed that her pulse was no longer reading on the machine and we called in a nurse right away. Luckily, there was a Priest who came about that same time and gave her, her last rites and she was pronounced dead. There is one image of my Grandma that will always be in my mind, and that is when the nurse, finally took off her oxygen mask after she passed.

Well, a few months ago, we had a procedure done with a lung specialist. They had to put my child under general anesthesia, which was incredibly nerve-wracking for me. I felt very anxious for the few weeks before, wondering if he was going to tolerate the anesthesia well, or worse, if he would die. I was also very worried about the findings of the procedure. Would they be able to figure out what was wrong? Were they going to come up conclusive, and we still wouldn't find an answer, and then would have to deal with another horrible New England winter with a deathly ill child? Finally, the day came. We checked him and we waited for the doctors and anesthetists to be ready. Even though the wait was only a half hour before the procedure was over, it felt like forever. I stared at the floor blankly, waiting for hospital staff to come in and tell us that he hadn't made it... That something had gone wrong. Tears streamed down my face. My partner tried to console me, but I felt completely disconnected to my physical environment; I felt disassociated. Finally, we got the news. The procedure was fine.

During the night of the event, the venue was very crowded. My friend and I found our seats which were very nice, and somewhat close to the stage. There was no opening act because John Mayer had wanted it this way so he had more time to perform this tour. My friend and I were talking to each other beforehand in anticipation. And then suddenly we were interrupted by the sound of guitar. The show had begun. John Mayer came out on the stage opening the show up with one of his most iconic songs, gravity. I surprised myself with tears in my eyes. I didn't realize how emotional his music made me feel until that moment. His opening number was definitely the most memorable moment of the show for me. I think it is because the anticipation I had, finally came to fruition. Ever since I was a child, I had listened to John Mayer. I recall my mother driving me to school playing him on the speakers while I sat in the back seat. This was definitely the best concert I had ever been to.

We were obviously very excited about it, we hugged and kissed and teared up very ready for this to finally be happening. We talked about it for a little while and then decided to go and get breakfast and discuss it over a meal. We ended up going to McDonald's and sitting down at a table, I believe she ordered a sausage McMuffin and I ordered an egg McMuffin. We talked there for a long time about a lot of different things having to do with preparation and telling our parents. We even discussed things like names if it were a boy or girl, we both wanted to have a boy but would obviously be thrilled with a girl as well. We talked about how we would tell our parents, she had a lot of ideas on the subject and I pretty well just went along with whatever she thought. We even talked about more obscure things like how our two cats would get along with the baby, or what to dress them for as Halloween. It was a moment in time that I think I will always remember, it's a joy that I don't really know if I can accurately articulate. In the back of my mind I've always wanted to be a father, I didn't know if I was ready for it but I think that I am.

I've ridden on the London Eye, and Niagara Skywheel, and now the Montreal Grande Roue. There was one crazy thing that happened while I was on the train.

I ran into and old friend from childhood that I haven't seen in 2 years and my brother who has been missing for 6 months finally came home and was knocking at the door!   This of course was the most shocking event of the past 2 weeks.  When I heard a knock at the door one afternoon after school I pretty much opened the door without even so much as looking to see who it was, which was my habit.  You can imagine my shock and surprise to see my brother that no one has seen in 6 months, and thought the worst, standing there before me!  It took a few seconds before I was able to scream out, you're back!  Thinking back now, my brother wasn't even the least bit excited to see me or to be home for that matter. It was almost as if he just went out for a few minutes and was back being greeted by a hysterical brother. He finally walks inside and I am still at the door holding it open when I hear another excited scream come from a distant part of the house.  It was my poor mother  who has been besides herself with worry these past couple of months. I slowly close the door and walk back inside to find my mother and brother.   My mother is asking rapid fire questions to my mostly emotionless brother who seemed to look like maybe this was a bad idea.  Where had he been, what was he doing and why had he not contacted any of us in all that time? The more I thought about this, the more agitated I started to become.

It doesn't bother me and I don't expect stuff like that to happen so I typically don't feel the lack.  About six months ago I started a friendship with someone in an internet forum where groups on people that primarily work online sort of gather to discuss things during the day.  We've talked frequently and even though we don't work together so to speak it has many of the qualities of a work friendship.  Anyone that knows me knows how I feel about my dog.  I'm quick with the pictures and he get's a fair amount of mentions in my day to day conversation.  My boy is terribly allergic to fleas and they've been very bad this year.  I've been fighting to get them under control and for the most part it hasn't gone well so my dog has been miserable. It bothers me. A lot.  Point being that I've discussed the flea problem and solicited possible solutions that I may not have tried yet within this group of people.  I haven't gotten much in the way of feedback because I've tried everything there is to try.  You're probably wondering where I'm going with this and I'm getting to it I promise.  A few Saturdays ago I took the dog for a nice long walk around the neighborhood relatively early in the day. It was gorgeous out. Bright and sunny.  That was nice but it really highlighted how bad off my poor pup was doing and I was feeling pretty crappy about the whole thing when we came back around to our street and headed down the driveway.  When I got to the door to go into the house I saw an Amazon box sitting in front of the door.  It had my name on it so I brought it inside and opened it.  Inside was one Xtra Large Seresto Flea Control Collar and 1 container of freeze dried liver treats.

It was the house we closed on the week before we got married -- it's the house we brought our son home from the hospital. We had so many mixed emotions about putting the house on the market. We wanted to move to a different neighborhood, back to the neighborhood we both lived in when we met, so it wasn't a sad occasion but I did not anticipate the bittersweet emotions. I did not realize how strong my emotional ties were to this house. Within the first few days of the house being on the market we got a full-price offer from a fellow, who by all accounts, walked into the house and absolutely fell in love with the place. I was so relieved that we'd found someone who appreciated the house for what it was (modest, no frills, mid-century ranch with a decent finished basement). After we'd gone under contract, we had to scramble to try to find a new place before closing. We knew the general area where we wanted to live but nothing was on the market that checked all the boxes and was within our price range. Then, on Friday afternoon while I was out of town, my realtor called and said she had a house that she thought we'd want to see. I couldn't go but my husband and my son went with her to check it out. It was perfect. They loved it -- they FaceTime'd me while they were walking through it and I loved it. We knew it would move quickly (given the nature of the market and the quality of the house) but I was out of town for the whole weekend and we hadn't taken any steps to secure financing. So that Monday, as soon as the mortgage office opened, we had a call into a mortgage lender who was able to approve us for the loan. Our agent worked out the contract details and submitted our offer only to find out that another full-price offer had been submitted hours earlier. We were crestfallen because we felt certain that, with two identical offers, the owners would choose the one that came in first. But, just our luck, our real estate agent happened to have a mutual friend in common with the owners and, because of this fact alone, the owners decided to accept our offer and we got the house of our dreams!", "label": "recalled", "group": "SIJNETCA"}

The doctor made it very clear that the type of exercise did not really matter so long as I was spending some time being active. The doctor also made it clear that not following the guidelines he suggested coukld have serious consequences. He let me know that I could become diabetic if I did not make lifestyle changes. He also let me know that I could be at risk of becoming overweight as well. Diabetes does not run in my family, so I was surprised to be given this news. I was sad when I found out that I had not been doing my best to take good care of my health.  Having this experience made me want to make some changes in the way I was living. Since finding out my health was at risk I have made some big changes. I make sure I am up on my feet more often. I also am far more aware of the foods I eat.

It's really hard to imagine how I will get over this, which is depressing. But I know I have to find a way to get past it. This is really affecting my relationships; reflecting back on the last few months I can see that it's really eroded my trust in people. I know it's not healthy, but it's so difficult to get over it! And seeing how Susie has pulled away has been a real shock; I realize it's been hard, but she is - was - my best friend. I tried calling her at Christmas time and when she hung up on me it was like a cold splash of water to my face. I was hoping that it'd be different once the new year started. New year, new beginnings, that kind of thing. I made this a specific resolution, as I've always been good with those as an incentive. But it really hasn't changed, and that makes me so upset. I have to stop worrying so much; I think that's really exacerbating my problems with trusting people, but it's also really tiring and exhausting. If I wasn't constantly thinking about the accident, maybe I'd be able to stop worrying so much. At least, I think I would. The other big impact is how much my confidence has been destroyed. I don't know that I was really over confident before the accident, but I did have some respect for myself, and that's gone now, too. It's sad. It's really amazing how much that accident has taken over my whole life; it's had such a negative impact on my quality of life overall, and my state of mind has taken a huge turn for the worse. I have to stop wallowing in self-pity and get past this; it's up to me to make my life better.", "label": "imagined", "group": "Y9RPJZZN"}

I had a tetherball set up in my backyard, lots of roller skates, bikes and scooters. I loved going hiking, taking my sister to the park, taking our dog for a walk and so many other activities that involved enjoying the outdoors. My love for the outdoors continued passed my childhood. Once I had my daughter, a lot of her activities took place outside the house. I definitely think I passed on the love for the outdoors to my daughter. About six weeks ago, my daughter and her husband took a road trip out to Texas. They decided to forgo Thanksgiving plans and instead go camping. They had told me of their plans and I was super excited for them. I wanted to join but I had already committed to a Thanksgiving dinner party. On Thanksgiving day, I get a frantic call from my daughter. She tells me she is bleeding quite a bit and she had missed her period for a few months. I told her to try to relax and suggested she call her doctor. She cut the camping trip short and returned home promptly. The bleeding continued but it had subsided a lot. She had an appointment a couple of days after Thanksgiving and a blood test revealed she was pregnant.

He's a really close coworker of mine and we work together all the time. Me and him went to our mutual friend's birthday party and we had a good time. Later during the party, I found out that for the past 2 years we've been working together, he had a crush on me! It was really nice to hear because I also had a crush on him too. We both always thought neither one of us were interested in one another so we never bothered pursuing each other. It does suck though because he's moving to New York for college in a few weeks so any chances of a relationship is zero to none. We're both not in a place to be in a relationship anyway, much less a long distance one. What was even more surprising was that he actually tried making a move on earlier in our friendship, but I was completely oblivious to it. It was really touching to hear that coming from him though. He's someone I get along with very well and we always have something interesting to talk about with each other. Upon learning this information, we decided to keep each other in touch when he eventually moves away. Maybe something will happen in the nearby future? We both have no clue yet, but it would be really something special. We don't talk as much because we're both insanely busy in school, but we hope to see each other soon for the holidays.", "label": "recalled", "group": "90I7RX1Y"}

We all love rollercoasters and thrill rides, which this park has a lot of.   Some of them were pretty scary.  There was a lot of walking around, the park is huge.  When lunch time came around we looked at all of the interesting things to eat.  We ended up getting a huge fish and chips plate to share between the three of us.  After lunch we decided to see a couple of shows that the park hosted.  They were very entertaining.  As it started to turn dark the park announced that it would be closing in a half hour, so everyone started heading for the exits.  Our time here was at a close, but it was very enjoyable.

This is all online, on the social media platform we met through. I admired her art. She admired my writing.

She's wildly out of my league and I'm not sure how she doesn't see that - beautiful, thoughtful, skilled, intelligent, she paints, she writes, she cooks, she's teaching herself to code - really, she's just absurdly amazing, anyone who met her would be bound to love her.

I was working at a famous restaurant in a major U.S. metropolitan area known for it\u2019s dining scene. The place was crazy busy as usual, with an hour wait for a table; the bar was three-deep; everyone was working full-speed-ahead. A couple walked in, obviously tourists: Fisherman\u2019s Wharf sweatshirt, sensible walking shoes, the kind of skin that suggests years of working outside. After making their way through the crowd, they walked up to the host and asked if they could sit one of my just-vacated tables. The host replied, \u201cYou can if you\u2019re Tippen!\u201d The guy handed the host a buck, who proceeded to escort the couple to their seats. Suddenly, I was told later, a man walks up to the host and asks why \u201cthose people\u201d were seated ahead of him and his wife, while they had been patiently waiting for well-over a half hour. The perplexed host explained that the host he called out the next name of the list: Tippen. \u201cBut I\u2019M Tippen!\u201d the man asserted. The host apologized, walked up to soon to be confused party of two, threw the dollar down on their table and blurted, \u201cThat\u2019s not the way we do things around here!\u201d It wasn\u2019t until the host walked back to assuage the passed-over guests\u2019 feelings that the homonymic connection between \u201cTippen\u201d and \u201ctipping\u201d would light up his brain like a bolt of electricity. The couple was allowed to finish their meal in peace. I don't think anyone ever explained to them what happened. I do recall they seemed rather befuddled and perplexed when I first went up to them.

I also had to start networking with people i have ever met in order to get job leads. A job search will no doubt have its ups and downs (and ups, downs, and ups again). To help you navigate the job hunt and, ultimately, land your first job, you\u2019ll need some direction. Get started by asking yourself these questions:What kind of job do i want,do i have work experience. Do i even know the industries I'm going to. Since i have no where to live i had to go back to my parents,i couldn't afford a apartment or just pay house rent or pay other bills ,i had to depend on my parents. Next morning i started looking for jobs in the internet and making applications,Calling friends. After a few weeks i was offered a job in a manufacturing company. A first job is special. There are a couple of reasons for this: the experience is burned in one\u2019s memory, it gives you the practice needed to fulfill other positions, and it teaches you about the value of money. Of course we do jobs around the house when we are young, like cleaning dishes, vacuuming, and doing laundry, but working for others for money gives off a different feeling. It was a cloth  manufacturing company. After a few weeks of practicing and getting grip on the work, my supervisor decided that I should work solo because she saw confidence in me, and I was confident as well that I could work by myself because I knew exactly what to do. When I started to work solo, I was given more heavy and hard work such as instead of ticketing price tags on shirts and t-shirts, now I had to ticket price tags on heavy jeans, jackets, school-bags, etc. I also had to pack those items in the boxes depending on the price, weight and size of the items. Once, I packed those items in the boxes by using tap-gun, I also had to put those heavy boxes on pallet and move it by using roller to a place where other employees would lift those boxes and put in trucks, which will send it to the stores. Despite being the youngest employee other employees were very friendly. Whenever i need help they were ready to help me out. After three moths i was promoted to higher position and my salary also increased since i was very hardworking and focused. Life was starting to feel better i had to move from my parents house and rent my apartment,i started also paying my bills is not that easy but i had to struggle and do other par time jobs.

I'm grateful for my husband for distracting me with talk of anything other than what was happening that day and rubbing my cold feet before surgery. It really is the little things in life that are most memorable. Breathing through one's nose is definitely something a lot of people take for granted.

It was sometime in July/August, and it was the first time I had tried something truly magical. This magical experience I had was due to me eating a few grams of Psilocybin mushrooms. It was sometime at night, and I had just gotten everything I needed to try them. I planned on making a tea out of the mushrooms, I read somewhere on Reddit that if you boil water and let the mushrooms sit in the hot water all of the bad alkaloids that cause nausea wont be there and that the effects wont be as strong. Anyways, after brewing the tea I decided that I should sit down and start enjoying my freshly brewed magical tea. About halfway through the cup, I felt butterflies building up in my stomach. I think it was just my nerves getting to me, but I was starting to feel pretty anxious about the whole situation. I did not know what I should be feeling or what to even expect. I decided to lay down, and not finish the tea. This is when the effects begin to really kick in, it had been about 45 minutes since I made the tea. It's hard to describe how I physically felt, but I think the best way to describe it is that I had absolutely no energy to get up. I was glued to my bed. Instantly I started to get very introspective, thinking about literally everything and anything. I was thinking about all the times I got angry, all the times someone did something for me, I started thinking about all my family members. It truly was a remarkable experience, as it showed me that all the problems I thought I had weren't really problems at all. I felt as I had complete control of the world around me, I felt connected to everything and all of my everyday stresses vanished just like that. Nothing mattered at that moment, this overwhelming experience of freedom brought tears to my eyes. I could not stop crying these tears of joy, I don't think I ever felt so free and happy then I have at that moment. I remember telling myself to right down all of these feelings because I did not want to forget about this moment.
