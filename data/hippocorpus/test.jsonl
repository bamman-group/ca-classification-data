I wasn't there and so I can't recall the details in full so I will tell you details my daughter recalled to me. Specifically the one I was told about by my daughter. I made it all up because I was ghosted from going to the ceremony, and because at the time I was desperate for any work that paid. Yes, he got married. Yes he had a long courtship and married a girl he is compatible with. I don't think that the marriage will last because she will see past the person she thinks she married and see the callous shell of a person he is. Here is the most memorable thing that happened at the wedding. At the wedding they had a friend that is a Taylor Swift impersonator. It was one of my daughter-in-laws best friends and supposedly she looks just like Taylor Swift. She sang at the wedding and impressed people with how similar she looks. She was a really good singer and my daughter said she even sounds like her when she talks to people. The signifance to me of my son getting married is huge and has been eating at me ever since. I did the best I knew how with my son, tried my damndest to raise him right and to be ghosted from his wedding really sucks. It hurts like no other feeeling I've had because it wasn't just the wedding it is completely. That's about all I want to write at this time, just hurts to bad.", "label": "retold", "group": "FXKH740E"}

Earlier that evening I had suddenly gotten my tax return in my account. I immediately sent a good portion of the money to my mom as me and her had agreed. I immediately called my best friend and asked if she wanted to hang out. She said yes under the condition that I'd leave at 12am. So, I took an uber to her place in the city and we hung out. I was quite drunk when I left, ended up talking to a random guy who I end up going to 7/11 with. While inside, in line, a different person walks in, demands my wallet and stabs me three times in my breast, arm and side with a box cutter. I was taken to a local hospital, scanned, was crying, and then was told they needed to do exploratory surgery on my abdomen. Now a few interesting things happen when you find yourself the victim of a violent crime. Firstly, now I had to recover from surgery. From there, I had to have quite an intimidating interview with the police department in the city. Of course, despite the fact this happened on camera in a store in the richer part of the city they did not catch the guy. Now, I found myself having to deal with the psychological horror of yet another near death experience, and still dealing with it (as this happened roughly 6 months ago.) Finding a therapist has literally took me this long. But, I had to find a silver lining which is, now I can stay on therapy if I lose my insurance (I'm currently unemployed and am on medicaid) due to our state's victims compensation fund.

When they finally got back to our house, most of it had burned. My room, my brothers room, the hallway, the kitchen, my mom's room, the living room, and the bathroom were mostly destroyed. The parts of the house that hadn't burned were destroyed by water damage from putting the fire out. Everyone else in my family was able to sift through the rubble the next day to find that, although their walls, floors, and clothes were ruined, a lot of their possessions remained in tact. Because the fire had started in my room, however, every single thing I owned was burned to ash.

Afterwards i had to leave my job, i was just too emotional to keep working, i still get a little choked up when i think about her but its better now, mostly. My boss and coworkers were very understanding of my situation and there was no hard feelings in me leaving. I'm not gonna lie, i was a bit of a mess. I didn't fall off the rails too hard but i did go through a long period of depression were it was a effort to get out of bed in the morning. That went on for awhile until some of my friends invited me to one of their church group cookouts. i kinda felt like a third-wheel and was dragging down the atmosphere but i appreciated the thought. i found it to be a very good experience and the food was delicious. After everyone left my friend asked if i wanted to join his group for other church events, and i said yes. they certainly kept me busy let me tell you, not that i minded. I think that was primarily what helped get me through my crisis. and at the end i liked involving myself so much that i became a regular face at church. Diary, if there is one good thing that came out of this, its that i found and renewed my faith in God.", "label": "imagined", "group": "HXBQ777O"}

It was a Sandals resort and everything was included such as drinks, food, and sleeping arrangements. We went for her birthday because she had never been out of the country and always wanted to. On the first day, we decided to just relax a bit and drink on the beach. It was a lot of fun because we could just talk together. I have never been able to spend that much alone time with my wife because we are constantly hanging out with our children. It was very nice to be able to get away. As the vacation went on we decided we wanted to do some sort of physical activity. We did a high ropes course right off the beach that made me a bit nervous, but that my wife loved it. I don't like heights that much and many objects were swinging at a high height. I was able to jump from space to space, but often would fall and dangle from the top. We also decided to go on a quick cruise that took us out at sunset to watch some dolphins swimming in the ocean. The sunset was absolutely beautiful and we didn't see many dolphins, but the company from being next to my wife was the best. Almost every night we would go dancing too. There was a bar that had a huge dance floor and lots of people would come out and we would all just dance together and chill. It was great to be with my wife, but also be surrounded by other people. We didn't want this vacation to end, but eventually we had to leave and return to our kids so we had to. I wouldn't trade this trip for the world.", "label": "imagined", "group": "ZTCWCIB7"}

I talked with them about the possibility of doing parking on their lots as well, with the option of splitting the proceeds 50/50 between them and me. It was surprising how beneficial the Garth Brooks concert ended up being because I made more money than I planned on making, and then that also gave me confidence to sell parking for a graduation ceremony a few weeks after the concert. After that, I sold parking for football games in the months that followed, and I coordinated with the neighbors I had talked to on Garth Brooks concert day, so that we were able to offer parking for the whole block on football games. Having the whole block available meant having approximately 30 parking spots to sell.  The football games attract large crowds and the ticket prices range from $50 to $100 depending on the game, so I was able to charge a relatively large amount for the parking spots for the football games. I was able to earn a nice amount of money that I then put into my savings.  Being able to \"live off the land\" by selling parking has helped me feel entrepreneurial while also helping to reduce stress by giving me a safety cushion of savings. I also found myself being responsible and helpful to the customers that were parking.  I learned that customers might have many questions about the event that they were attending.  I tried to prepare beforehand by reading details about gate opening times and other event-related details, so that I could answer questions questions might have when they were parking for the event. I have been pleasantly surprised because I made far more money than I anticipated making, no one had any problems with their cars, and my neighbors were able to make a good amount of money by entering into the 50/50 agreement with me, so the whole block of residents has enjoyed added happiness in recent months as a result of me first doing parking fo the Garth Brooks concert 8-and-a-half months ago. I also got to enjoy the good feeling of being able to offer tailgate chances for the football fans who wanted to park at the game very early before game time. The tailgate parties that developed on my parking lots remained safe and I made sure to patrol the areas regularly. I wanted to make sure the vehicles were not threatened, the people were not misbehaving, and the area was maintained in a clean manner during the event.

Once back to the hospital, we found out, blood flooded in her brain and needed an immediate surgery.  She underwent that and once back, she was okay for a couple of days. Then again, she had the same symptoms.  Once again, we took her to the hospital and the doctor told us because of her age, she cannot be operated and told us to make her comfortable as long as she lives.

We have visited there many times and now that we do not have to stick to a schedule, it seems like the perfect time to find a permanent home there. We have friends that retired to the Big Island, but I think we would like Maui a lot better. It is very easy to get to all the different islands. I also know I would be able to see many of my friends that are still in the Army if they are coming through Oahu. My husband will be working for a little longer but he can work remotely. We have enough saved up in our travel fund that we can fly to Maui a few times to find a place to live. And whatever is leftover we can use toward our down payment. We are hoping to find something with a detached guest room area so that people can come and visit easily. It will also be really convenient to be closer to Asia so that we can do more traveling Being in the Army has offered a lot of opportunity and changes but I am very exciting to be able to be on my own schedule and devote more time to my personal hobbies. I am also excited to be able to grow more fruits and vegetables in a more tropical climate, and with more time to devote to the garden. It will be hard to say goodbye to the lifestyle that I known for so long, but so exciting for the next chapter in my life. I am glad to not have to use an alarm clock to wake up anymore!

Also, it's just as likely that your kid is intersex as it is that they have green eyes, but we don't insist there are only brown eyed people or blue eyed people. But my wife and I are dumb and uneducated Trump supporting types, so we ignored all of that complicated stuff and decided that the genitals of our child will determine like 90% of it's life. We will assume all kinds of things about it, and we will have a gender reveal in order to invite those assumptions from out friends and family so that they can also participate in conditioning this baby to conform to whatever the relevant norms are for people with those genitals. We had the reveal and it was great. It turns out my baby has a vagina. It's weird when I say it that way, but is that not all I'm communicating when I tell you that it's a girl?

{"id": "3A0EX8ZRN9ADZQU0917ND0PTHLQBYX", "text": "Let me tell you about the first time I used a chainsaw. It happened at the end of May this year. My mother got a letter from the city about some land that she didn't know she owned, and how the overgrown state of it was making the neighbors upset. They gave us a month to clear the land or they'd do it for us and put a lien on the property for the amount it took to do so It's in a residential neighborhood and apparently health and safety is important. She doesn't have the kind of money necessary to pay someone to do it, so my mother decided that I would do it for her. Mom went down to ABC Rental, and rented a chainsaw, lawnmower, and what I can only describe as a chainsaw on a stick (which I was too scared to use). There were only 8 dead trees on the property, and my sanity does appreciate that, but I had to cut down each one by myself as my mother chain-smoked in her car. Well, she was there on the first day, I had to come back several times by myself. Did you know that equipment like chainsaws don't take straight gasoline to power? I didn't, and I was really surprised to find out I needed an oil mixture to make it all run. And, though the guys at ABC Rental told her this, my mother didn't see fit to tell me about it at all. So, after some severe googling, I finally got the thing running. I had to look up videos of tree cutting on YouTube in order to see what I was supposed to be doing. Cut out a triangle in the direction you want to tree to land, and go for it. I went for it. It didn't really work. Or, I didn't really work. Using a chainsaw requires an upper body strength that I don't have. The trees fell in the general direction that I wanted them to, but I had to be really careful about where I was and what I was doing. Which is natural, I guess. It was so much work. I, as a 32 year old woman completely unequipped for this type of task, did my best. I could only do one tree per day because I tired out so easily. I will never do this type of work again.

After enjoying the rainbow for some time I noticed there was a nest build on my window sill. I cannot believe I almost missed this beautiful sight. The mother bird was a rare shade of pink I have never seen before in nature only in the zoo. But the most majestic part of this experience was the eggs that laid peacefully still in the nest.

The mother bird was always so attentive to the nest and watchful over these eggs. Just before I left for holiday I saw an egg begin to crack. I unfortunately never got to see the birds hatch.

The two of us, the original friend who posted it and another friend of theirs were able to get a quad cabin and go. I wasn't sure what to expect and was a little nervous about what to pack or what the experience would be like. I have gone to lots of concerts for year and I always am happy and comfortable at rock concerts. From the time we got on the boat I felt at home and like I was meant to be there. The first night of the cruise one of the bands I was most interested in seeing was doing a performance in a pretty small lobby area so I made sure to get there early so I could get a spot; I was able to get a spot on the stairs looking down on the stage and the performance was nothing less than chill inducing. You could feel the passion in their performance and everyone watching was locked in enjoying it. At one point the singer said that they were just a bunch of Texas boys used to sitting around a campfire with an acoustic guitar and beers and singing, he and one of the guitarists went and sat on the bar and did what turned into a singalong of a classic rock song. Everyone in that lobby area all the way up to the balconies looking down was signing along. I felt at home and actually teared up at what a special moment it was. Throughout the cruise we would run into band members all over the place; in the dining hall, at the ports, in the casino, just hanging out and they were all nice as could be.  I left my phone in my cabin most of the time and wasn't even concerned with taking photos or videos of performances, I just lived in the moment. I stood and talked with band members of bands who I have been a fan of for years and they seemed to have a genuine interest in what we were talking about, I got to meet people I never would have dreamed of meeting and I discovered some new bands. Since the cruise ended I bought a meet and greet for one of the bands when they were in my town and I mentioned that we \"vacationed together\" and all of them lit up talking about the experience. One of the members of the band had been sitting behind me with his girlfriend at a comedy show and I offered to buy them drinks, just because I'm a fan and appreciate what their music has gotten me through and done for me. With no prompting, he looked at me and said, \"Wait. I remember you, you bought me a beer! My girlfriend and I really appreciated that!\" and we had more of a conversation about the cruise.

The challenges were difficult mainly because we did not have a direct procurement manager. The Quality Assessment and Quality Control manager was also acting as Procurement Manager. So his time with the department was limited. So I found tough to take his opinion in several important issues which lead to lot of delays, and sometimes I had to take risky decision. Two months back, this particular manager resigned and the new QAQC manager did not want to take procurement responsibilities also.

Ugh! There was also the standard aloof messages that just said \"Hi,\" \"Hello, how are you,\" and things of that general nature.

Holly and I then checked out his profile and generally stalked as much as we could lol. Then she decided I should reply back to him...I did but almost just so she would stop making such a big deal out of it. Well, much to my surprise, he replied that night and after Holly left I chatted briefly with him as I got ready for bed. Amazingly, I didn't find any of our initial conversation cringy; we just sorta hit it off. Our messages back and forth were honest and it felt intriguing. I went to sleep that night wondering a bit about this new guy but I didn't really have my hopes up - the guard was definitely still up. Anyway, over the next few days we exchanged messages and at some point, I gave him my cell number and we started texting! About 1.5 days into this, he called me and asked me out to dinner --- and soon --- it was going to be the next night; I was nervous but I agreed to meet him. This is where I generally thought things would fall apart as they usually do, but that night we met at a small, quaint, Italian restaurant downtown. We ordered a glass of red and some pasta and what ensued was awesome and blew me away. We talked and talked and just generally enjoyed our food and company.

The dreaded Check Engine Light was lit on the dash which meant the truck wouldn't pass fuel emission testing which was required for vehicle registration, it had been lit for a while but tended to go off for a while before coming back on for a while which was why I had never had a mechanic look at it.  I had received a notice to renew my registration well a head of time and could have done it then as the dash light was off at the time, but I procrastinated and when I finally decided to get around to it the dash light was lit again.  With less then a week left till the deadline the dash light went off again and I decided then to get the registration renewed, and I thought using my vehicle diagnostic computer I got from Autozone to clear the error log on the truck's computer would make sure the dash light wouldn't come on again.  So I was stunned that during vehicle testing when they plugged their computer into my truck's computer that the test failed, apparently my clearing the error log had cleared all data and if there's not enough data in the vehicle's computer it fails the test.  They asked if I had disconnected the battery for any reason and I just went with that, I was too stunned and miffed to tell them anything different, and the advise they gave me was that a highway drive of about an hour would be enough for the truck's computer to gain enough data for the test.  They also advised me that if the dash light came on to not bother bringing back for retesting.  So with just a couple days left till the deadline I spent my Saturday on a roadtrip, and the dash light came on.  I was frustrated, even a bit panicky thinking what it was going to take to get this truck to pass emissions so I could renew it, and kicking myself for the procrastinated that caused me to miss the earlier chances to get the renewal done.  Again I pulled out the diagnostic computer but this time to see the actual error code, then spent time on the internet researching.  I felt a fair amount of hope when I found the problem was well known and had a solution.  Vast majority of the time replacing the EGR valve solved the issue, many just cleaned their old one and managed to cure the problem without having to buy the part.  Didn't have time to try the cleaning method due again to my procrastinating, so off to the parts store to spend money on a new part.  Luck finally seemed to be going my way, found a place that had the part for much less then everyone else, and just as I was going to the store that damn dash light went shut off again.  With the new part in my truck passed the emissions test, online I got the renewal done with just two or three days to spare, and I haven't seen that dash light on since.", "label": "retold", "group": "S9GYZGLD"}

When this happens he goes to my parents house (where i live) and caused infrastructure and mental destruction. It depends on the epsiode but most of the time  it involves yelling and screaming that is very frightening.  The  scariest day I can write about was the day that my  parents were leaving for vacation to vegas, They were only going to spend the weekend. Unfortunately, the weeks leading up to the vacation were a bad couple of weeks mentally for my brother. The fact that my parents were leaving Miami disturbed him and he was causing all sorts of trouble  leading up to the vacation like Arguments, Fights at the house, mean text messages. Before my parents  left my father told me I would be in charge of the family business while hes gone. We manufacture vacuum pump trucks so its  not an  easy  job, there's a lot of heavy machinery  involved, so i was anxious myself  because I had been handed a big task. Its the day that my parents are leaving  for vacation and I'm fast asleep waiting for my 7:30 alarm in slumber. As I'm dreaming I begin to hear something in  my trance like state and start  slowing awakening to Traumatic sobbing from the terrace of the  house and at this point I'm not sure if im still dreaming or some weird sound is coming from the outside. As i  awaken more I notice its my brother hysterically crying while my dad hugs Him. Its very strange that hes showing up  at 5am because he never does this. His crying was the first stage of his manic episode. I dont like to see him  like this so i often avoid speaking to him when hes in his very sobbing and depressed state. So i  tell myself I'll go ahead and  take a shower so maybe he wont see me. I'm very spooked, You have to understand that his manic episodes that start  with depression are by far the worst, It lasts longer, days. I get Into the shower and as I'm taking off my clothes I hear the door to the bathroom start rattling around like someone is forcefully trying open the door.

That amount was 3,000 dollars. While 3,000 dollars may not seem like a lot to most, it was a lot of money for me at the time (and even now). It was a Monday evening, and I saw that the Houston Rockets were playing the Utah Jazz. I wanted to bet on Houston because they had near-even odds (3,000 to win nearly 3,000 back, which would result in me having 6,000 in total) and because they had a 3-0 lead in the series. I had a strong feeling that Houston was going to win this game, so I bit the bullet and dropped the bet. It was a nightmare from the beginning. Houston was already down more than five points after the first quarter. I was already in a state of shock at this point, despite there being three quarters left. I already felt hopeless after the first quarter. After the second quarter I felt that it wasn't the end of the world because there was still a lot of time left and it was only about a five point game. Then the third quarter came along... Houston had a great third quarter and even took the lead. While my anxiety wasn't gone at this point yet, I felt a lot more calm than I did after the first quarter. I felt that Houston was gonna seal the deal, as they only needed one more quarter to win. Then the fourth quarter happened... It was an absolute nightmare and Utah absolutely crushed Houston. All of my hope went down the drain when this quarter began. It seemed as if Houston didn't even care anymore and wanted to throw the game away. At the end of the day, Utah won by more than 10 points and I was in absolute shambles. I couldn't believe what I saw and negative thoughts were the only thing on my mind. I had no more money to my name and was contemplating many things.  After this event, I kept gambling until I realized that this would ruin my life if I didn't stop. While I haven't stopped entirely, I am progressing towards stopping as I am gambling much less and much less frequently.

It is refreshing when we both choose to be open and share how we really feel. A moment like that happened about four months ago. I was feeling down about my recent work experiences and slightly depressed due to memories of some past traumatic experiences. During this moment, he spent extra time with me doing simple things. We ate dinner together, watched movies at home and had long conversations. One night he stayed around and let me read a book to him. I really enjoyed his presence and appreciated the effort he put into assisting me to feel better. But I still was down. I am a bit of a nerd and enjoy technology. When he and I met I told him how I wished I had a laptop at home and internet connection and how it would make me happy. I guess he remembered after all those months. A month goes by of feeling down and out of the blue he suggest, \"Hey lets get you a laptop and I can provide internet connection.\" I was shocked, that idea was not on my mind. When I am depressed I don't think much of what I can do to improve my life. I loved the idea and I felt as if the clouds in my rolled away and revealed sunshine.

I was thirty six weeks pregnant and not expecting to have him for three more weeks at my scheduled c-section when I unexpectedly had to go in to the hospital due to the fact that I was not feeling him move much.  I went in for monitoring and they kept me overnight.  They monitored his heart rate and it kept dropping, so in the morning they decided they would go ahead and do the surgery.  They couldn't figure out what was causing the decelerations.  I had left my house the previous night at eleven p.m. not thinking I would be staying overnight and certainly not thinking I would be having a c-section in the morning so I was totally unprepared.  All I had with me was my purse and my husband was back home with my other three children who had been asleep when I left.  I excitedly got ready for the surgery, knowing that within the hour I would have my baby in my arms but also nervous that he was going to be okay and that I would be going through surgery all alone.  Everything went smoothly though.  The anesthesiologist was really caring and sat right next to me throughout the surgery and talked to me.  When I finally heard my son's little cries, I knew everything was going to be okay.  She held him beside me while they finished stitching me up and then finally after nine months of waiting I got to hold him.  I went to recovery and held my perfect little son in my arms while I waited to go to my room.  Then, I spent two nights and three days in the hospital with my new little son.  It was hard because I had never been away from my other three kids before, but it was also special having that time just him and me together.  It had turned out that he had a full knot in his umbilical cord which is what was causing the heart decellerations.

That got me, eating into my willpower. My legs and lungs were burning more than they had during training. I think the energy used to start the race sapped me a bit but I powered through that mile hoping that I didn't collapse. Funny, mile 19 seemed to last longer than the rest of the miles combined. I was so wrapped up in my own head, thinking about the negatives that could occur that each step seemed like it would be my last. Somewhere in mile 20 I caught my breath, got my stride and rhythm back and was able to get back on pace.

I thought to myself, \"this is it\", I am dead.  But I felt a presence echo through me, so deeply that my whole body shook.  It said one thing only - \"NO\".   I woke up a day later in the hospital.  I was told I was saved by another surfer who saw me drowning.  Even after 26 months I still dream about it, the drowning, the acceptance of death, and the...something else out there.  The divine something telling me \"no.\"  It's not your time.  I feel truly blessed and protected.  I now search for the reason why I was saved by god.  There must be a reason why I was pulled back.", "label": "imagined", "group": "J4UL0YWQ"}
{"id": "3YMTUJH0DT2XX5AXKGA1X5R8TBY4T7", "text": "I was about to get a foreclosure a year ago. I am the first owner. It was a new condo community in 2017 in a shore beach rental community. So I assume the idea was to make money on the increase in equity in The hot market back then. I bought it two years ago from the original owner, my dad knew him well. Apparently original owner was a mortgage broker and he and another guy bought 3 units. His main one is the one I bought. His partner(who I don\u2019t see around much) still has a condo. I tried to sell it because I was moving to a new city, and there was many problems with the house. I bought it for 217 2 years ago. When cleaning found some mail that said the dude actually owed over 600 K so maybe he got a seconds mortgage? Anyway, I think he\u2019s still a mortgage broker, hopefully a little wiser. IIt's been a year and it sat empty it deteriorated and the roof leaked so it was cosmetically bad, but no major damage. During the cleanup I found what I guess was a note his daughter wrote to him telling him to cheer up and smile as her and mommy were worried about him stressing out, and that they still loved him. Kind of made me see the other side of this foreclosure mess. had to call lawyers and get it handled, it took a while for them to tell me I couldn't sell it. One other thing was most of the bathroom doors had holes in them like someone punched them. Not sure if it was him or the renters. So, it was kind of sucky to be profiting off someone else\u2019s mistake. But I cant move now, I guess I'm stuck with this as my home for now.", "label": "imagined", "group": "72QE3JB0"}

After a lengthy and bitter divorce with my now ex-husband, I was very excited to be able to finally plan this trip. We all needed a relaxing break. My children and I were very excited about the trip! Several extended family members ended up coming on vacation with us. They essentially piggy backed on our trip, which was great. Though the trip was meant to be a time for my kids and I to relax and simply enjoy time together, I had heard about other people visiting schools in the area, and bringing along gifts for the school children. I thought that was a great idea and did some research about doing something similar while we were there. I contacted the concierge at the resort we were going to stay at, and she made the necessary arrangements for us to visit a local school. The concierge was nice enough to provide me a list of items the school would need the most. I sent this list to my extended family members who planned to join us on the trip. We all purchased items for the school children (school supplies and toys!) and packed them in our suitcases. I have to say, visiting the school was the highlight of my trip! It was very enriching for my children to see the conditions of the school in Jamaica. I made sure to point out to them all the differences between their school and the school in Jamaica. I think it was a great learning experience for my kids and it was important for them to see how good they have it at home. I definitely feel this visit had a positive impact on my kids, and helped them to appreciate what they have. I would highly recommend this type of experience for anyone going on vacation to a third world country.", "label": "recalled", "group": "LXA0TC47"}

My parents had just gotten a divorce and my dad decided he wanted to move to Florida, leaving my mom, whom I didn't have the best relationship with, and I, in Atlanta, GA. I've always been a daddy's girl but I kept a lot from my dad to maintain my innocence in his eyes. Following my parents' divorce, I started hanging out later, I was drinking, I was using marijuana, and I was promiscuous. My grades suffered and I had begun spending time with multiple guys just for the fun of it. I was filling a void that my dad could no longer fill. Though I was spending time with multiple guys, I had strong feelings for one, Joshua. Joshua was smart, funny, a good listener, popular, handsome, a gentleman, and still a tough guy. I knew I was a lucky girl so eventually I dropped the other guys and committed myself to Joshua. But prior to commitment, I made the mistake of sleeping with both Joshua, and another guy, Corey, around the same time. Two months later, I realized my period was late, I was nauseous all of the time, and I had weird sensations in my body that were flu like. I told my best friend Ashley at the time about my symptoms and she told me that she would go to the dollar store with me the following day to get a pregnancy test since they were just as reliable as the name brand tests, but cheap. The next day, Ashley and I went to the Dollar Tree and purchased three pregnancy tests just in case I messed one up. I took the test at her house since her parents weren't home and I didn't want to risk running in to my mom at home. It was at this time that I found out that I was pregnant. I was scared, worrying about what I would do with a baby, and wondering whose baby it was. My mom was disappointed, I couldn't tell my dad myself that his princess was pregnant, and while Ashley was excited, it wasn't enough support to raise a baby. I needed stability, support, a job, personal growth, and I needed to finish school. My only hope was Joshua but he was not too happy about the fact that I was unsure of who the baby's father was and respectfully told me that he wanted nothing to do with me but that he would be a friend and see my decision to the end with me. Corey also wanted nothing to do with me, as far as he was concerned, I was a hoe. I felt like my only option was to terminate my pregnancy. I cried days before ending my pregnancy, during the process, and days following the procedure. I was broken, and I felt alone and helpless because I never wanted to have an abortion but I had no one. Now five years later, I find out that my dad would have been willing to help me raise my baby had he have known I was with child, but neither me nor my mom mentioned it to him. Though I was happy to hear that my dad would have had my back through whatever, I am heartbroken that I terminated my pregnancy out of fear, and I don't know how soon i'll ever be able to forgive myself.", "label": "imagined", "group": "13BXD7R5"}

This was a very emotional moment for me because I fought for my children for three years, and as a father looking to gain custody of his children it was very difficult. My children were being abused by their mother, and no matter how much proof I provided the courts, they still allowed her to have primary custody of the children. I have never used drugs in a my life, yet the children's mother was using regularly (that's why we separated) for three years. In order to get \"just\" three weekends a month with my kids, I was forced into taking drug and alcohol tests, anger management, etc.. During this time their mother would routinely violate the order that allowed me to see the children on the weekends. She would curse at me, threaten me, tell me I was trash, all right in front of the children. There was a small period where I honestly started to believe the things she would say to me, almost as if I had accepted that I was trash, even though I was doing everything right. I guess after a while I just started to break down, I was constantly in debt due to the cost of lawyers, and was just mentally drained. Thankfully I had my family to pick up the the pieces for me, and my children to keep motivating me. In January of 2019, their mothers neighbour called children and youth on her, and abuse was found to be taking place in the home, and in the end custody was removed from her, and given to me. The amount of relief I experienced is not measurable. The day I received the order signed by a judge, I just remember breaking down and crying. I dont think I will ever forget that day. Even though I was able to gain full custody of the children, I still hold sort of an resentment against the legal system. I honestly do believe if I was not a man trying to gain custody of his children, and the roles were reversed, it would have taken less than six months.

A routine of getting up to watch the roof eat and go back to bed, my self-esteem and consciousness were fragile at that time. With that situation for a person so active in social or sports activities, it was a very strong blow to my lifestyle. My mother at that time offered to serve me in the church, I was not very comfortable with the idea but I had no argument to deny her so I decided to give it a try and enter the production area to learn to put together event lights. From there I began to meet great people who have been every blessing in my life. From that moment on every Sunday I attended to learn faster in my service area, I talked with everyone in the church to meet them in addition to spending my free time simply enjoying the free coffee service. All the activities that the church was attending without hesitation since it wanted to see in its entirety as the community towards its goals and objectives with these activities. as once we went to a hospital after a sharing among all church servers to give our patients time to chronic diseases. Seeing their reactions and their stories was pleasant and makes a difference in your way of thinking towards the world and towards yourself. In addition, the church moved to a new terrain towards which I have been able to witness its growth from 0 to date. which gives me a very strong sense of belonging to the community. In addition to building stronger ties with people and living unique experiences with them while we build a place for those who seek help and peace. To date I am really happy and comfortable and able to solve the problems that life presents. There is still much to solve but I no longer feel anxiety if I don't get excited to see the result of my future actions.

She was pretty but I couldn't tell much her bio other than her major and that she was a tour guide. A couple hours later I get a message, \"you may have a baby face, but it's adorable. What are you up to today?\" We seemed to have a lot in common, especially since we both knew the university and area well. I could tell even through text she was someone. We hammer out the details, she's no more than 7 minutes from me in an apartment complex. I get there around 7pm and head up to the apartment and I'm very nervous. I'm pretty introverted so meeting people like this is not my thing. She opens the door for me and looks like her profile. We talked for awhile introducing ourselves and decide on a movie. The stream was having buffering issues so Deadpool turned into a 4 hour movie. But I was glad the movie kept pausing, because we talked a ton and I knew there was something about her that made me feel comfortable and at ease. About 5 minutes into the movie she slides across the couch and goes \"excuse me\" and bumps into me. I still laugh about that to this day. For the rest of the movie we cuddled, adjusting so that we were laying down. It was a great time overall, and after that we cuddled for a bit. Fast forward to 7 and I have to go to work. I've been at her place for 12 hours and never slept. From this point on, we're constantly seeing each-other, I realize I love this woman and she feels the same way.

I was fully expecting to come over to his house and sleep over as we usually did, but he obviously did not have the same idea as me.

I've been trying to grow sugar maples in tissue culture for three years and have not had much success. In May, I was able to get three times the number of plants to survive than I've had in the last two years. These plants that have survived have continued to survive and I've been able to experiment on them with different media components and hormone concentrations to get some of these plants to root. The plants need to have roots to really thrive and without them, they can't live for very long. Last month I was able to find a hormone concentration that is starting to stimulate root production. This is very exciting and gives me a lot of satisfaction because there wasn't much information in the published literature to use as a guide. I had to take information from different plant species and come up with my own concentrations and trials. In science, we have a lot of frustration. We have to constantly repeat experiments and come up with new ideas. It's fun and challenging but it also comes with stress and frustration. We have a grant for this work, so it's been tough to have this project not work well. If we need to reapply for additional funding, it would be tough to justify it for a project that's not working. The maple trees I'm working with are higher sugar producing tress that are valuable for maple sugar growers as they get better syrup from the sap of those trees. With increasing insect pests that destroy these trees, it's important to have a tissue culture source of the trees. I really enjoy when I can get a project to work.

I just remember seeing him post surgery, post chemo and everything and just not seeing the man I grew up knowing. He lost most motor abilities and the ability to speak. The recovery took 3 years and still to this day he is just gaining back the ability to speak coherent partial sentences, enough for us to understand him. Now with the cancer in remission I feel relief, joy, and some angst as the doctors say the woods are still yet to be cleared but for now everything seems to be moving along well. Part of me knew he would be tough enough to fight through this as he is already capable of driving on his own, which came to much shock to the doctors as that is a rare recovery component so early into rehab. This is part of the reason why I have hope for his recovery because this man battled adversity his whole life to become who he is today and to lose all of that in a matter of weeks was certainly heartbreaking. As I reflect on this recovery I am constantly overfilled with emotions as I keep rethinking the situation over in my head. I feel I am being pulled in every direction as I am unsure how to entirely handle the recent news of the remission. My friend seems to be feeling the same as me and I try to show my emotions on my sleeve in front of him and provide needed solace. All we can do is wait and hope the cancer continues to diminish as the odds of this case of cancer reappearing are still high. I have high hopes that within the next year or two I will be celebrating with him as he continues to live his life to the fullest and now be brought down by this disease.", "label": "recalled", "group": "F6D43YCX"}

Not thinking much about it I never really considered that they might have infected me. About four days later I started feeling bad and within a day had a raging fever. Great I thought, I've probably got the flu although it seemed a rather odd time of year to get the flu. I was very sick for 3 days and finally decided to go see a doctor. The diagnosis, a virus. Wait a couple days and if the fever doesn't get better, call them back. In two days I felt much better. Another week passes and suddenly I started getting this strange rash all over my body with a bulls-eye rash on my back at the tick bite site. I refused to believe it was serious and waited. Several more days passed and one night I developed a raging fever. This began to worry me and my wife was beside herself, emphatically trying to get me to see the doctor again. Finally I relented and made the call. The diagnosis this time was Lyme disease. My joints swelled, my head hurt and I was sick with a fever for several more days. The doctor prescribed antibiotics and in a couple days I began to improve. The process is slow though and I still have residual symptoms. Some people have these for months or even years.

It's always seems to be the same scenario - they think I'm over confident.  About two months ago, I was given a peach assignment as a lead on a project.  I was so excited and energized while my colleagues were kind of resistent and downplayed the importance of the project.  They told me I was too optimistic because in the end the project would fail like all the other projects regardless of effort.  They told me it would be a big fall if I didn't come down from the clouds.  Instead of listening to them I started looking at the psychology behind their attitudes of impending failure.  I realized that they were missing the \"what's in it for me\" concept.  They saw no benefit for them to a lot of effort and hard work.  I saw this as a challenge.  How do I make them see their effort as a win?  How can I quantify and qualify the outcomes of their efforts.  I decided to make sure every project task completion had an outcome of reward both tangible and intangible.  I showed them how the effort and work they are doing benefits their customer, and themselves.  The reward of  successful completion leads to provable skill and knowledge.  I found the sweet spots of their sense of accomplishment and motivations and used it to garner their buy-in and support.  With everyone on the same page moving us toward success my colleagues were genuinely more helpful and excited to help me as a project lead.  In two months time the whole attitude of our team has changed.  They no longer see me as the young pup.  They h ave accepted me as a leader even though most of them are 20 years older than me.  I don't feel anxious and eager to please.  I have found their motiviations and I have earnestly tried to encourage and care for their successes as well as my own.  Last week I was able to provide a recommendation for a team member who intially had resisted the project because of her 180 degree turn around. Because of her changes in attitude she became a focal team member and will be leading her own project team soon.", "label": "imagined", "group": "DARHIVNL"}

So I told my boss I was going to put in a three week notice in so I can just focus on school from now on. When it came time to move my moms boyfriend had no money, absolute nothing to his name. So my mom quit her job and had to pay for everything for the move we didnt even have a moving truck so my boyfriend offered to let us use his grandpas truck . So we moved all of our stuff out of our home and put it in storage. My mom then told us to bring clothes enough for three days cause well be staying in an airbnb until his so called money came through. So three days had passed and his money still wasn't around so we had to go to another airbnb this happened for five weeks. We hoped around to different airbnb's, not to mentioned no one in my family has a car so we had to depend on me and my sisters boyfriends. So June 13th came around and this happens to be my nieces birthday we had planned to order her a cake from a place on Ubereats, because at this point no one in my family had any money at all, so we had to use my Venmo account to get food every night to eat. So my moms boyfriend messed up the dates we were suppose to be there, so the maid came and told us we had to leave, because another tenant was coming. So we had to hurry up and get our stuff and leave, thank god my boyfriend was off and decided to spend the night, the night before. So we leave and went to a coffee shop so we could figure out our next move, we ended up sitting there for over three hours, so me and my boyfriend went to his house and told them to call us when they had a place. They never found a place and I've been at my boyfriends house every since, my mom and her boyfriend are homeless and having been sleeping at the hospital with my grandma and sometimes hop from house to house with my moms friends.

I was really touched by the fact that people were willing to do so much for me. I didn't realize how special of a gesture it was to plan a party for someone without their input. The most memorable part of the evening was when I came up to the balcony and saw all of my friends. I knew they were going to be afraid of my reaction, but I think I was able to act happy enough to convince them I wanted the party. This was also very significant to me because it was a birthday that I was planning on doing nothing for. If my friends asked me to have a party before this event I would definitely have turned down the idea. Another thing that made the even very special were the choices of food and drinks. My friends chose to have Mexican food, and also chose to drink tequila. Mexican food is my favorite type of food and I love when it is paired with Tequila. I think the choices of food and the choices of guests are what made the night so successful.", "label": "recalled", "group": "MRB967NX"}

They had moved out of town to take a job in a different city but we still tied to keep contact over social media.

It felt super awesome to be able to talk to Bobby after so long a time. We talked a bit and got caught up on what had been happening in our lives up to this point. He mentioned that he was visiting his parents and that they happened to be out that day, just hanging out and such. It was a nice day to out indeed and seeing my friend made it that much better.

His arm just dangled there like a wet noodle.  I had a friend and her daughter for a sleepover.  And while the kids were playing on the slide, my son bumped his arm, and started crying and would not stop.  That's when I knew that something must be really wrong with him.  While I felt guilty, it was night time so I knew the only option would be either to keep him at home or take him to the ER.  I thought going to the ER would be more traumatic than helpful so I just put some ice on his arm, and put him into bed with me.  After I got him settled down, he was able to go to sleep.  In the morning he was back to his normal self, except he still wouldn't do anything with his arm. So I took him into urgent care because I knew that they could do x-rays if need be.  The doctor asked me questions about how it happened, and I felt bad because I didn't know how it happened.  I told her we thought that he fell off the coffee table, but we weren't entirely sure, since no one saw what happened.  In the end, it turned out that he had broken his left arm.

My son walked in all scratched up and told me he fell off his bike. We had many good years with Cosmo. He loved being with his family and going to the dog park. He loved cuddling on my wife's legs. When he was only 8 years old the vet detected a heart murmur. The murmur progressed to heart failure. My wife was very depressed and so was Cosmo. We got a puppy to cheer everyone up and it worked for about 9 months. It gave Cosmo a job to do and got him out of his depression.  Sadly, he had a stroke and could no longer stand up.

During that month again, my partner's other girlfriend reached out to me that she wanted all the 3 of us to go to a quiet cafe during the night and have a discussion with each other so we could get to know more about ourselves.

At first, everything was going well and we were living happily ever after. I found it exhilarating to be out and away from my familiar surroundings, as I would have to rely on my boyfriend to figure out how to get around. I soon noticed things about my boyfriend, as I have phases where I think very critically of people. More often, though, I have many phases where I see things that attracted me to this person. But, while thinking critically of my boyfriend, I noticed that he has certain moments where he gets very relaxed, during these phases, he takes things for granted. He is ok with laying on the ground to do repair work and sometimes urinate out in the open and he doesn't mind my seeing his private parts. He sees himself as a handyman and he doesn't like a lot of critical thinking that is required to solve problems related to mathematics and the physical sciences. He tends to or appears to get envious of me, when I want to talk about solving problems, so, when it comes up, he likes to switch topics. Over time, he either wanted to dominate conversations or not have talks at all. He likes to order me around, probably not fully realizing what he's doing, and, I have to depend on him for transportation. I would need to rely on him to get me back to my past living location, where I'm familiar with the area and have family and friends. When a confluence of things came together, I realized that I wanted to get back to familiar surroundings and around my family and friends. But, my concern about how he would feel about such a request made me hesitate to tell him that I'd prefer to be getting back around my friends and family soon. But, my critical mind kept me thinking about these features that he seems to have more and more, as time went on. So, out of mounting frustration, I came on him light and hinted that I would rather return some place to be much closer to family and friends. When first mentioned to him, he brushed it off, so, soon, I became more assertive, as required. So, one time, I was very abrasive and direct with him. He became sad, after being surprised that I really meant what I was saying. Thus, when he finally agreed to bring me back around family, friends, and familiar surrounds, things were such a relief for me, even considering his surprised and sad demeanor. I was so relieved, when I got back, in all honesty. But, after having a few days and weeks to consider our parting day, I started to become more and more considerate of his feelings. So, I started to communicate with him again, after some weeks and he was nice, relieved, and happy to be hearing from me again. I thought about the qualities that I liked about him and I wanted to ease back into a close nit with him, but, I would also still need some distance to be with my familiar surroundings. Things would have to grow on me and I would need to adapt.", "label": "imagined", "group": "DI2AXT20"}

She was throwing up even water. She got weaker and weaker so that she couldn't even make it outside anymore. We knew the end was coming and even though, since her tumor developed, we knew it would happen, we weren't ready to let her go. In her later years, she'd developed some anxiety and didn't like to be away from the family. So, rather than take her to the vet, we kept her at home so she'd be calm. We stayed with her round the clock, petting her and talking to her and letting her know how much we loved her and how grateful we were for her being with us and letting us love her. In the early morning hours a few days after she first fell ill, she passed away in our arms. She went peacefully and with us there to say goodbye. We prepared a spot in the backyard, which she loved to spend time in, so she'd be in a happy place for her and close to us forever. She has a nice spot that gets plenty of sun because she loved to lay out in the sunshine and just soak up the rays.

I'm getting to the age that I want to settle and get a house/ wife/ etc, so I need a stable job to support that.

It was unexpected but I thought this reflected well on my past performance as an employee. It appears that the organization is going through a restructure and my former employer thought my input and guidance would be useful during this challenging period. My former manager, who asked me to return as manager of a newly forming team, said he believed I would be a great asset in bringing old and new employees together to help drive the organization forward. He also said my old team had been affected by my retirement and their productivity was not quite as good as it had been under my leadership. Admittedly, I do miss my former colleagues and team but I do not miss the pressure of my former position and having new and harder targets to achieve on a regular basis - not only was it hard for me but even harder leading others to achieve. My former industry is becoming more and more competitive as new technologies are released and more talented people are attracted into the area. My former manager also offered me a significant pay rise and good bonus potential. I was very tempted by this offer especially as my 401k and social security could use the boost! That said there are many aspects of the job I don't want to repeat even with the temptation of potentially new ways of doing things. I was happy to retire as I was getting very tired and stressed by the demands of the organization and industry. I do not think I have the energy and ambition to tackle the more unpleasant aspects of the job. Still, the offer had me torn and I asked for a week to think things over. My former manager said that would be fine and he hoped I would return. During that week I called some former colleagues to find out what had been going on within the organization since I had retired. They all agreed, separately, that the industry has indeed become much more competitive and the organization was struggling to keep up, hence the restructure. Most commented that it had been and still was a difficult and stressful time. Some said they envied my retirement and wished they could do the same! The things my colleagues said helped me make up my mind to turn down the offer. I enjoy being retired too much to return to a highly stressful job.

The presentation was a group project where we analyzed Wingate Test data.  I had done most of the project myself because I did not fully trust my group member, so I was quite nervous. Despite the problem, we did quite well, and it was reflected by the grade that we received later on.  However, at the time, I just knew that we stumbled a bit.  I then went on to a different building where I began to study for the more challenging task of the day - an anatomy practical and exam.  I had been studying ALL over the past week, which a much heavier emphasis on the prior weekend for these.  I needed a good grade here to maintain my 4.0 average (whereas my grade in my stats class was relatively safe).  I studied in this building from approximately 9:45 AM to just shy of 12:30 PM.  At this point, I headed up to the floor where my exams were and changed clothes (scrubs are a must in the anatomy lab).    After changing clothes, I went to the hallway just outside of the lab where classmates were starting to gather.  I sat down and studied just a bit more before the professors arrived.  Unfortunately, I did not make it into the first group of test takers (the practical only had around 10 stations and there were 16 students, so we had to be be split up).  This meant that I had to hang out in the hallway for a bit longer while the first group took exams.  While there, I studied and had a conversation with a girl about our dogs (we both have a dog named Darwin).  Finally, it was time for me to start the practical.  I went in, and had some uncertainties about a few of the stations that made me feel pretty miserable - I was certain that I was going to lose my A.  After the practical, we moved on to the written exam, where I was able to brood some more about my performance on the practical.  As I struggled through the exam (it was the hardest one yet), I just knew one thing - I was tired.  As I finished (with only one other student in the room), I slowly got up, walked to the teachers and turn in my exam before I left towards my car.  I had decided that I was going to to go to the store and get some wine.  On the way, I checked my phone and much to my surprise - they had already graded and posted to grades for the practical.

I was walking around with my son it was sunny and a little bit windy we were eating an ice cream and sharing some jokes.  All of sudden i saw a tail from underneath a car , I told my son to help me see what that was , he told me not to move and he went to look for whatver it was moving. I was so nervous because I was so sure it was an animal and it was probably hurt so I felt scared and sad at the same time. I heard my son saying something I couldnt understand followed by the winning of this tiny little white thing , it was the most beautiful thing , a tiny white ball of fur. I felt so in love and scared for him , it was a boy. my son and I took him to the vet and after he got all the shots and a full check up and we were told that he was in perfect shape we decided to took him with us to our home. we made the decission to call him Max it sounded powerful but with a lot of character just like i think his personality is. he ate so much the first 3 days it seemed like he wasnt eating much the time he spent at the streets. After 2 days we got a phonecall from the vet , they told us that they found the brother of the dog we found , we couldnt believe it , so now we didnt know what to do. We had a long conversation about separation and what damage that could do to anyone and that includes pets , so we decided to adopt the brother as well .

He always trusted me to do my work and gave me so much latitude. He made me a partner in the firm and would always tell me how much he appreciated my work. He made sure my 401k was well funded and that started me on a course towards saving a good amount for my retirement. I will always appreciate the fact that the job made me financially secure. We had our disagreements but we will always be close. I realized how silly I had been to worry that he had bad feelings towards me after I had left the firm.

So I decided to do something about it. I always dreamed of owning something. I wasnt sure what I wanted to own but I wanted to be in charge. I love making art, so I rented a space and started making art. I learned that many people like making art but dont have the space or supplies. Thats where I come in. I started hosting 3 night a week classes and events. We do wine and pottery, tye dye shirts for kids, and free form art. My business has really taken off. The rent is easily covered by just one week of classes, and the rest goes to me or supplies. I have enjoyed stepping out of my comfort zone.

We went over to visit her often during treatments, went to the hospital when she was checked in for the initial treatments, and generally kept up a lot of support. Me and Kiddo thought it was important for her to know we were there for her. She seemed to be handling treatment well. Then, out of the blue, she had a massive stroke which reduced her to still alive, not needing life support, but also not able to really communicate. We had no way of knowing what she did or did not process, understand, feel, etc. So we acted on the DNR she had signed before and provided nothing but water. It was so difficult to see her there in that state, basically slowly dying and fading away. As (then) executor of her trust I began to gather everything I needed to make sure this went smoothly for my cousin (her beneficiary). It was hard to post her final goodbye to friends on FB after she passed, but I did what she asked. Then I discovered: she had not fully finished setting up the trust and I had very limited resources. Much to my surprise, I was completely unable to do everything she asked, and had to resign as executor and hand it back over to my young cousin and be there for him for support. I did what I could to give him all the info he needed and put him in touch with the trust attorney. Sadly, and surprisingly too, since I last wrote about this he has not done well. He still needs help accessing all of the resources she left him and after his power was shut off reached out for help.

We recently went snowboarding in the high country and my daughter got two really good days in on the slopes.  The comparison between skateboarding, surfing, and snowboarding is loose, with each having their own intricacies, but the base balance is the same.  We put in extra work at the skate park before we headed up north, and I tried to help her work on balance more than tricks.  Rolling in on the bigger ramps and boxes and trying to speed around the park without taking her feet off the board were key in simulating the snowboard experience.  But the one thing we could not account for was the bindings and/or the fixing of the feet to the board.  This is a very unnatural feeling and hard to simulate or get used to when first on a snowboard, but I think the work we did in the skate park was beneficial. We put her in a lesson to start the trip and she gained confidence from the instructor, who was not her dad, and learned the basics of movement, stopping, and keeping a tow or heel edge.  On our first trip up the lift, she seemed confident but also had some trepidation.  I encouraged her with my early experiences and tales of how long it took me to be able to get down a run without falling.  We both fell getting off the lift and I think that put her at ease a bit, to see me fall and recover to help her exit the landing zone.  Once we were strapped in she had some issue adjusting to the steepness of the run, as it was much steeper than the hill she took the lesson on.  I helped her get her heel plow down and told her it was the easiest way to stop or slow down if she got going too fast.  Initially, the heel side riding is easier because the muscles are stronger and the angle is better to \"dig your heels in\" rather than try to dig your toes in - at first at least.  The first run was very frustrating for her after feeling like she did well in the lessons, but I was so proud of her to want to get back on the lift after some tears, screams, and bumps and bruises.  Again a proud dad moment and it got better through out the two days - way better.  She was right on the edge of getting the feeling of snowboarding in control and I could see her confidence boost after each run.  I'm sure the two days snowboarding will improve her skateboarding and I'm eager to get to the skate park this weekend!", "label": "retold", "group": "2NSYHCJG"}

After that, we went to Kentucky Kingdom. It was a small park, but had some nice coasters. Unfortunately, it was 100 degrees and humid, and for some reason the water park wasn't open.

Instead, we continued on to Carowinds, and got to ride Fury 325, which is now my second favorite coaster. We spent two days in Charlotte, where Carowinds is, and then headed to Virginia to go to Kings Dominion. The park was amazing. We both loved intimidator 305 and Twisted Timbers.

They made a custom menu for us and we were able to have all of my mother in laws favorite foods. The macaroni and cheese with bacon was my favorite. The chicken Parmesan was also very good. It felt really good to give her this party because of the terrible year she had. I can't imagine how hard losing her husband must have been.

It was a collaborative project, neither of us could have done it alone, but we were also kind of competing. We knew that management was monitoring our progress and that the open Supervisor position would probably go to whichever one of us appeared to be the highest performer. I felt as if I had done really well, contributing most of the labor to the project. However, Ray also did a good job of keeping everything organized. I guess I demonstrated more work ethic, but he demonstrated better project management skills. I say \"I guess\" because here we are, three months later, and Ray is the new supervisor. I'm not really upset, although I am a little disappointed. After working with him on this project I do like and respect him, both as a coworker and as a leader. Obviously I wish I had gotten the promotion instead though. I will probably remember this incident, so I can bring it up at my next performance review. I will ask management if there was something in particular that affected their decision, and if so, are there any suggestions on how I can improve. I will also ask if there are any alternative routes for my advancement, since Ray has taken this open position. Who knows, maybe now that Ray is a Supervisor, he's privy to the behind the scenes action that led to this decision. I think I will ask him about it, and see if he knows why he was picked over me. I'll make it clear there are no hard feelings, and maybe he can help me improve so that I will be the top candidate next time around.", "label": "imagined", "group": "LCC613Y3"}

I had to do everything on my own, so I wouldn't scare my family. I had to make many severe lifestyle changes, hold everything together, and slowly heal myself. The consequence of my illness is sudden, unexpected anaphylaxis. Every day, I  never know when a life-threatening attack could happen. I live minute-by-minute every day. When you have a disability, the \"little things\" no longer matter. There are too many \"big things\" now taking their place. \"Ablest\" problems are so minor. I felt like I needed a frame of reference for what really matters in life. So I took a few mental notes from the experience. I've limited my social interactions and reached out to more positive people/friends. I think it's important to practice self-care, and this time I'm putting myself first. I found a new therapist who's helping me work on my mental health, and how to cope with the future I am now facing. She helped me explain to my parents what my diagnosis really meant, and assure them I will probably be OK. Fortunately, several good things happened. I bought and renovated a home, trained a service dog, published my first book and started feeling more like a normal (healthy) person again. I have a very savvy medical team and my illness is well-managed. My family are supportive about treatment options and care. I stepped right back into life during a time when I knew I could die at any moment. I did things I used to be afraid of doing.

It all started early on a Monday morning at work. Typically Monday and Sunday are the most stressful days for me because of my dislike about being stuck at work for the week and that the weekend had ended. So generally I am at least a little more stressed those days than others. That morning I also had received a couple voicemails about a couple bills that had been paid for a non-profit that I am part of. Looking back it was an honest mistake because we restructured the organization and thus needed to also change the bank accounts. Generally we had a treasurer that took of those things, but once we had restructured he had left so I was in charge. Unfortunately, though I had very little idea as to what accounts we had out there and what we paying for and how we were doing so. But at the time being in the accounting industry it was stressful because in my own life I am very good at paying bills and always worry about missing something. Those calls got my stress level up to a certain point, but elevated even more was realizing that during a transition period of acquiring a person's work I failed to bill a tenant for several months. Even though I talked to my manager about it and we worked it out it still got my stress level up even more and eventually over the edge. It was around noon that I noticed that I was real jittery and issues typing or even talking. Things seemed to be serious to the point that I took of work and went to the hospital. Upon check-in they believed I may have actually had a stroke so they announced a stroke code upon which several doctors came and gave me a blood transfusion and several tests. Once that was all over though I began to calm down and feel much better.  In the end they did a couple radiology tests, which came back negative and they believed I probably did not have a stroke after all. It was only later that after thinking about it more that I thought it was more of a panic attack.

The day was fast, we all talked and laughed and we cleaned up my sisters room together to get everything we wanted out of it before she left, I remember watching her walk up her stairs and go out the door, and get into her car and leave, it was a little heartbreaking. My brother just left, we had both cleaned his room too and he was ready to go, he had been getting in fights and arguing with my mom a lot, they were both ready for him to go. They had both prepared for college and were going to be leaving soon around 6pm, they were getting ready to go on with their lives, and to live their futures without me. I felt happy for them, I know they were both going to do great things, one was going to art school in new Jersey and the other was going to study Dance in Chicago, both prestigious places. I did feel great sadness though, they were two of my closest friends, two people who really understood me, and they were both leaving, and I had few other people to talk to. I tried to get them involved in everything before they went, I tried mini-golfing,movie watching, mystery shopping and just plane video games and board games, and we did have a blast, but it was depressing knowing they were still going to leave the very next week. I even got them involved in money making schemes like apps and survey programs, but they weren't interested, my best friends they may have been but they still didn't share all my interest.

I was scared at first because I was unsure of the workplace culture and I felt weary that I wouldn't fit in. On my first day, I got to know my boss a little bit more since out small conversations during the interview process, and she made me feel comfortable at work and showed me around the workplace. I met some of my coworkers, who are now good friends of mine, and I just remember being uncertain and anxious about whether or not my boss would decide to keep me on the job. It'd been about 9 months since I'd graduated from college, and I'd been rejected by jobs I'd been applying for left and right. It was soul sucking and I felt stuckl; I thought that I would never find a job. Even after getting hired for this one, I was still in disbelief that it even happened and I was preparing myself internally for the worst or for something to somehow go wrong. On my first day, I was over dressed. I saw this as mostly a good thing, as I wanted to make a good first impression on my boss and my coworkers. Though, it was scorching hot outside, and I wished I could have worn shorts. For lunch I had Five Guys delivered to me and it was ridiculously delicious. All throughout the day, my boss was telling me everything I needed to know about my job, my duties, processes that go on at work, who to talk to about what, and all sorts of other useful information. It was definitely a case of information overload, but I was very eager and fully capable of handling anything she threw at me (like ideas, I mean).

Truthfully, I was just trying to get acclimated to my new environment, while also being terrified that I would lose this new job somehow.

At the end, the event was able to raise a lot of funds for the children of Haiti and many school supplies were donated for them to have a successful school year. It was a truly amazing event that I will never forget surrounded by even more amazing people. In the end it wasn't about the dance groups, the attendees, or who did the best. It was all about the kids and who we were raising money for. Doing good for your community as well as others in need really humbles you and makes you realize how much you have.

We went to the store and purchased several more watermelons and stopped by the farmers market to see what they had and was able to buy freshly picked strawberries. We also bought a box of potatoes and brought all the food back to the party.

When I arrived at the beach it was very hot and humid outside but when I walked out on the beach it cooled down because of the ocean breeze. The beach was clean but very crowded. I found a spot and laid out a towel on the sand. There were many broken seashells on the beach. There were several tide pools on the shore. When I walked along the beach I looked in the tide pools and noticed baby crabs. There was also an adult crab I tried to catch it but it ran away.  This is memorable because I rarely ever get to go to the ocean and I always enjoy the time I spend there.  I remember walking along the beach and seeing dolphins far out in the ocean.  I remember getting in the water and feeling how cold it was. I spent about two hours there before going home. The most memorable part of my trip was seeing the dolphins from afar. It is rare that I ever see dolphins in the ocean at New England because I don't usually see much sea life at this particular beach.", "label": "recalled", "group": "135MUQVA"}

At around 6 o'clock in the evening, I suffered a massive panic attack and fell into a state of intense emotional crisis. I've been battling with EXTREME anxiety and depression for near a decade now. This disorder developed as a result of a traumatic experience with a very high dose of psychedelic mushrooms in late 2010. In order to cope, I eventually turned to the realm of spirituality. Practices like meditation, yoga, and self-inquiry helped me to better manage the immensely dark feelings that I would encounter on a daily basis. But my relationship with spirituality changed overnight on the 1st of may this year. The panic attack centered heavily around my spiritual practices and this gave the crisis that followed an existential theme. Other themes were present as well such as identity and metaphysics, but they all fit neatly under the umbrella of spirituality and an inquisitive mind. I've since sought out medication and counseling which has allowed me to slowly regain a sense of normalcy. Giving a description of how emotionally scarring a true existential crisis can be is virtually impossible as no words can do it justice. It shook me to the core and persisted for weeks and still persists to some extent to this day. I was practically bedridden and totally paralyzed with fear and anxiety for hours at a time, day after day. As gloomy as this sounds though, I firmly believe that good can absolutely still come of it.

I had just dropped him off and was headed out to take care of some errands.

I composed myself quickly and we both pulled over to assess the damage.  To no one's surprise, a young woman whose phone was glued to her hand had caused the accident.  I was not happy about the time and expense this was going to cause me, but the girl was as helpful as she could be.  It was refreshing to hear her agree that she was 100% at fault.  Her father also had premium insurance, so everything would be taken care of.

During the arbitration period the defense and the state negotiated a custody agreement that did not remove the mother's rights permanently.

It had been about five years since I had last been a pool. Since I was about 8 years old I had been swimming competitively over the summer at my neighborhood pool, from there I swam for my high school team, and then around the same time I began swimming for a club team. Between morning practices before school and then practices after school as well as the occasional swim meets that took place throughout the week my schedule was booked. I would go to my club practices every Saturday meaning essentially I got one day off every week which was Sunday. When the season was up for high school swimming I would go on to continue swimming for my club and then during the summer I would do both club and swim for my neighborhood swim team. Swimming was my life. It was all I had known since I was 8 years old and when I was 18 I had to make the painful choice about whether or not I wanted to continue swimming in college. I ended up choosing having a social life over swimming to a lot of people's dismay. Towards the end of my high school career I was emotionally and physically drained and I felt like I just needed a break. So I went on to have a normal college life with no swimming involved. It was difficult. The guilt definitely took a toll on my subconscious. I would have dreams all the time about getting back into the pool and I wondered if I had made a mistake.

The interaction was just awkward but I made the best of the situation. I didn't yell at him or call him out of his name but for a second I thought about hiding his book while he was in the bathroom. Anyways, he acted like nothing had been happening in the last year which made me think he was in denial. He's trying to cope with her death and has turned into a zombie. I was kind of shocked but he looked bad. I asked him how he felt and he responded with a 'I'm Good.\" We all know when someone responds to you with those words, they really mean \"Not Good.\" Before I left book club I decided to ask him where he was staying. He told me that him and his girlfriend live together in town. I'm glad I know because I will avoid the area. I just want to punch the asshole for not even acknowledging her death.

In the morning everyone claimed to not have turned it on. The next night it happened at least four times, it was freaky. By day three the bathroom light was turning off and on as we were in the bathroom. We inquired at the front desk, but ultimately they did not have any answers.

My wife and I had started to be more physically active in an attempt to be have a healthier lifestyle. We had always wanted to go camping together, but haven't had the time. Our wedding registry actually consisted of mostly camping and outdoor gear, and now we have a chance to use it. After arriving at the park, we scouted out a nice area to setup camp near Lamar Valley. This area was chosen primarily because of reviews about the hiking trail. After two nights of eating hot dogs cooked on a campfire, we decided we would go hiking in the morning. We packed our backpacks with some trail mix, beef jerky and some extra water. After a big breakfast we began our journey of the hike. The scenery was incredible! We took a lot of pictures of the view with my wife and I posing for selfies and silly poses. While I was taking a picture of my wife up against a tree, I saw a figure move behind the tree. I put up a finger to shush my wife and motioned for her to creep towards me. She turns around and sees a bear 15 feet from her and screams! I began to roar at the bear and make very loud noises trying to scare it away. Amazingly enough, the bear ran away back into the woods and we raced back to our camp. We escaped with no physical harm done, although it was mentally jarring and nerve wrecking. The rest of the camping trick was spent at our campsite as we were too scared to continue hiking. The trip was overall enjoyable and we had a good time.", "label": "imagined", "group": "A1TV1XUE"}

We had the food catered and everyone was able to drink and dance the night away. It was special to spend it with the people who knew us the most and were closest to us. It was the best day and I look back on that day with such fond memories. The sun was shining and the weather was warm, but had a great breeze. Nick and I had so many special moments shared together with the ones we loved.  Our mom had the best time celebrating us and they could not stop smiling that day. I remember the dance with my dad and how he told me how special I was and how proud he was of me and that I picked the right man. He want so happy that I was happy.

We went to Little Ceasers arena and got to watch one of our favorite teams battle it out against the top team in North America. I don't go to a lot of sporting events so it was novel for me to get swept up in a cheering crowd or scream when something awesome happened on stage. Unfortunately they lost but the games were close. My favorite moment was getting to hear one of my favorite songs live and hear the stadium hum and sing along to it. Although a close second was getting to go backstage. We didn't get to meet any of the professional players, but we got to meet the tour manager. Backstage was amazing to see, they basically had to set up a whole home office just for a weekend. Besides just the event, I got to play games with my friends in person and hang out in their houses, and I loved every moment of it. I also brought my dog with because I talk to him constantly while I'm in a call with my friends so it felt right that they would finally get to meet him.

One, how important it was to get together with all my brothers: this hardly ever happens. that we are all together. It was also important and a very rare occurrence to get together with all the cousins on that side of my family. It may be the first and last time that happens. With distance I also realized that some of my angst about mortality stemmed from a compounding effect--the funeral was the same week as my brother Joe's 50th birthday. I am the next up to hit this milestone.  This is part of the reason I connected it with my own mortality so much.  It was also an odd conicidence that they both occurred in the same week.

The starter was beginning to act funny, and I knew I would need to do something soon, but I really wasn't prepared for this. It was my wife's idea. She's always the one that wants to spend the money in our house. The last one to work for it (she hasn't held a job in the nearly 5 years we've been married) and the first one to want to spend. What's ironic is that the day before, we had gotten into a humongous argument over, what else? Money. It's always the issue around here. But with that being said, it was a horrible idea to go looking at cars that day. We had made up from our argument, and of course I wanted to avoid upsetting her again. We ended up walking out of there with a 2018 hyundai sonata. Now it's a beautiful car by anyone's standards, the problem is it's about 200 dollars more than what we were paying off on our old car, and I still have about $8k left before I even pay that off. We had decided we would let that car get repo'd and just enjoy our new car. We'd make some simple lifestyle changes to cover the difference. We'd start eating food at home more, and my wife would stop drinking. One of those things happened. Want to guess what it is? I don't know if I can keep going on like this.

He was 88, and we knew that this would make him so happy. The kindness and sheer simplicity of our visit is something that we all will never forget. The people of Ireland are friendly, welcome long lost kin as if we had been best friends forever, and take part in a simpler way of life that just held so much meaning for my Dad. Evenings were filled with music, as friends and family gather in someone's home for a nice night of Irish ballads, whiskey, good food, and lots of laughs. My dad loved the old fashioned meals, with fresh butter, eggs and vegetables right from the farm we were staying at.  He could not get over all the sheep that his relatives owned. My Dad, even at 88, ( now 89), makes a point to walk about five miles a day, and found the little lanes and paths in the villages we stayed in to be special, like travellng back in time. The highlight of the trip was an AA meeting. My Dad came back from Korea and promptly developed a drinking problem, and very luckily, sought help from Alcohol Anonymous in 1954. The has faithfully gone to weekly meetings since then , and this year, celebrated 65 years sobriety. He went to a meeting not too far from where his grandfather grew up, met some wonderful people, and said it was a memory he will carry with him through eternity. Another great by product of this trip is how it keeps my siblings and I close. We each take turns choosing events or trips to take together to keep us close. We lost our mom when we were very young, and we know just how important family can be, because you can lose a part of it in an instant. That's why the Ireland trip was so important. For dad to meet cousins, and other relatives really made him feel part of his history. My brothers are into motorcycles, and while eating at a nearby pub, met some other like minded distant relatives, and went on a nice long ride all along that section of Ireland, on rented bikes. My brothers are all Harley boys, but enjoyed the Irish motorcycles a lot. One place Dad wanted to see , was St Patrick's Cathedral inDublin, so we took him there. We have a picture my brother Tim took, of Dad walked down the long aisle toward the altar.

We looked for so long and finally found just the right place, I mean we knew we would have to downsize our things coming from a house, but we just knew it would be worth it. The new place is so walkable, our neighbors are interesting and the place is gorgeous and just our style. The problem started though when we really got into downsizing. I thought it was going to be so much easier than it was, we were arguing all the time about who had to throw out what. There was a lot of resentment and hurt feelings, because naturally, the things that aren't yours don't mean much to you. So when I saw Derek's skis that he hadn't used for nearly two years I was determined to make him get rid of them. Why would we need skis in South Carolina?? We never take those kinds of trips. Or any trips really, so that started another fight about how we never travel anymore and it just became a huge mess. Who knew that something so seemingly insignificant as throwing out some clutter could bring up so many unrealized problems? I really saw how bitter I was about not traveling anywhere aside from our family homes and feeling like we were becoming boring. Really, this apartment and it's proximity to some excitement and nightlife was the hope on the horizon. The only obstacle being that we were at each other's throats and still loaded down with junk. I made a lot of concessions and threw out so many things, and unfortunately I threw out things out of resentment too. I regret tossing my white linen blazer. Who cares if he thought it looked silly? I really liked it. Anyway, we ended up getting through it all and moving into our dream house (apartment). I really love this new place, and I've been walking or riding my bike everywhere.

Feeling we had nothing to hide, we simply acquiesced. He began just rummaging through the glovebox, and we knew we were fine. Nothing to find, here. Then he knocked a book out of the door panel and out emerged an empty bag of marijuana with a few flakes clinging to the interior of it. It may have been there for three, five years, who even knows? What we do know, is that was enough to put my buddy, the driver, in court the next morning. The judge was aghast the officers had wasted her time over some amount of marijuana that equated to fish food, and she released him that same morning. We never went back to that city again, because usually a rolled stop sign does not cause a quasi-disaster. We henceforth were much more careful about leaving discarded trash in the car.

She is excelling at school and meeting the demands of living in an apartment versus our house or a dorm with maturity.  She is so enjoying having a kitchen at any hour of the day or night.  She is branching out with her kitchen skills and making candy.  This is one of the ways that she manages her stress.  She is extraordinarily shy but is handling dealing with the leasing office with questions that have arisen and navigating an inconsiderate room mate issue. She is doing very well with her budgeting, paying bills on time, grocery shopping and preparing her meals.  She is fascinatingly frugal. It has now been 2.5 months since we have seen her.  Looking at the calendar with her because I miss her and want to visit she is firmly but kindly letting me know she has a lot of responsibility and a visit will set her behind and mess with her routine she has established.  She thrives on routines and a visit would throw hers off and be a source of stress.  Even though she misses us, she is self advocating for what she knows is best for her.  With Thanksgiving approaching I expressed concern about her being alone for the holiday weekend.  She let me know she is reaching out to a friend group to see who is around and making plans.  Then let me know she will be home for a month two weeks after Thanksgiving which is not far off. I am very proud of her and love seeing her mature on a weekly basis.  She is growing into be even more responsible and independent than I thought she would at this stage of her life.  And she's right.  She's got this.  She's been on the Dean's List each semester in a major so demanding the Advisors for it do not cheer them on but rather question their commitment since  most classes will not transfer to a different major.

I was midway through my pregnancy, which is a difficult time as the visits to the doctor are still spaced four weeks apart. This means that for four agonizing weeks, we do not know for sure how the baby is doing. Once we visit the doctor, we can get confirmation that her heart is beating and that she is growing on track, but until then, we do not know for sure. Once the baby starting kicking, however, it was almost a lifeline back to sanity and away from anxiety, as I at least knew that she was alive and moving. That said, it was easy to start wondering if it was really her I felt kicking, as she was still so small and the kicks were fairly light. At times of worry, I would start to wonder if I was imagining it, or if it was digestion, or something akin. One night, though, the kicks felt quite strong, and I asked my husband to touch my belly and see if he could feel them. His eyes lit up, and he said he felt them. He lifted his finger each time he felt a kick, to see if it corresponded with what I felt. Sure enough, the kicks were at exactly the same time I felt them. This confirmation of my experience, and the chance to share it with my partner, was incredibly moving for both of us. It felt like our connection deepened and grew, and we were both filled with awe and excitement. Since then, we have had our baby. There have been many more meaningful moments, but this first shared touch still holds a special place in my heart.", "label": "retold", "group": "UP0PX9DW"}

I would be busy with schoolwork or studying, but in truth I just wanted to stay at home and watch TV. My appearance began to suffer as well. There were many days when I didn't even want to take a shower and sometimes wouldn't. One of my closest friends started to become worried about me and told me that she thought I might be suffering from depression. Of course, I scoffed and laughed it off. One night about a month ago, I began to sob uncontrollably and began to feel really desperate and sad. I called my friend (the one that told me she thought I might be depressed) and talked to her for a couple of hours. After speaking about perhaps beginning counseling, I started to think that it might be a good idea.

We figured, if not now, then when? When we get married? When we have kids and jobs and other responsibilities? If there was a time to do this, it is now. We packed out small Honda and with minimal planning went on our great adventure! And it was amazing! We set out to check out this great county and it's amazing vastness and natural beauty. Main goal of our trip was to hit every national state park we could but also visit major cities and hit their night scene and experience their culture and cuisine. We started in Missouri, our home state, and handed west, through Kansas, Colorado and Utah util we hit the Pacific coast in California. I always wanted to dip my toes into the Pacific Ocean and now I finally had a chance. We took some scuba lessons and enjoyed our time in Santa Barbara. We were also amazed by California's red forests! You can believe it until you see it! The size and majesty of those trees will always remain ingrained in my mind. After spending some time in CA, we circled back to Arizona to visit the Grand canyon. I am not afraid of heights but my boyfriend is, so needless to say, I had great time but on the other hand, he really didn't . From Arizona we headed east to New Mexico and , of course, we had to check out what all this hoopla was about area 51.  It's amazing how much business is devoted to \"little green man\" in here. Although we don't believe in conspiracy theories regarding alien abductions and such, we had to get souvenirs and gift for out friends. Our time on the road was almost over and we continued east through parts of Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas and finally back to Missouri. I must admit, after all this time spend sleeping in the camp sites or cheap motels I was so happy to finally get a great night sleep at my own bed!

It was like my brain was giving me an instant damage report.  Maybe it was real or maybe it was just the result of me hitting my head.  But, tht is the one thing I most remember about the incident.  I ended up twisted in an odd position on the first landing of the steps and my right foot had broken through one of the banister railings.  I layed there for a few moments, not yet feeling the pain, but knowing that I was hurt badly.  My mother came from out of her room to attend to me, trying to help me up at first, but when I screamed in pain after she pulled my arm, I just told her to call for help.  The EMTs arrived quickly  and I think I  must have ruined their night.  They questioned me like I meant to fall down the stairs and then didn't bother to brink a stretcher to move me to the ambulance.  They grabbed my by my arms and pulled me down the stairs , out of the house and into the ambulance like I was a soldier being evacuated from a battlefield.  I was in pain and pissed.", "label": "retold", "group": "LJQ6R6WO"}

They were something new to me, having only grown up with cats. There was a particular golden shepard that I felt an instant connection with. He was 3 years old. Through my time at AFL I learned he was available for adoption. After short consideration I knew I was in a comfortable place to bring a dog into my home.  I decided to adopt that golden shepard.  I have named him Bruno. I have had a great month with him. I look forward to several more years together.", "label": "imagined", "group": "HR9JYGL2"}

He did not, as one would say, go peacefully. But at least I can say he went into peace. It had been a long, slow slide down, with his claws dug into the side of the cliff, and he may have thought he was climbing some of the time. Since losing the use of his legs some twenty years ago, his life had become a daily struggle to perform even the simplest of tasks. The life that had become drudgery, with us, his daughters, the only bright spot, he'd somehow still wanted to keep. He'd dug his teeth in like a stray dog into a scrap of bone. Then, he had a heart attack while going into an MRI machine. He was dead for twelve minutes. But God sent him back from Hell, and not only that, but woke him up. That doesn't happen after twelve minutes. He was able to talk and respond to questions. Perhaps dying had killed the stubborn part of him. He was able to accept the peace of God, speak to his daughters for a whole week, and say goodbye. And then he pried his fingers off the side of the cliff so suddenly that I was the only one there to observe his fall.", "label": "recalled", "group": "Q5VYPC5E"}

Then we at the italian food for dinner and had some cake.  The cake was white wedding cake and very good.  There were more drinks and even some dancing.  To take a break from dancing we went outside to get air.  But it was still hot outside, so we walked around the garden only for a little bit.  THen we came back inside.  We danced for about 2 more hours before it was time to go. Overall, it was a great evening and the couple seemed pretty happy. What made it so memorable was the good friends that all came together.

Eventually i got a chair and just sat spraying the mist and letting the bird flutter around. They are incredibly beautiful creatures and also very small. I worried i might get it too wet to fly but that didnt happen. I was happy the bird was there and it seemed happy to be getting misted. It was a wonderful moment of man and nature coming together.

She is kind enough and claims to be \"non-judgmental\", but loves to dish out judgment whenever it suits her.  That said, my daughter thought this was a better way to live than to stay with us.  As she is 18, there is little we could do about that.  However, that doesn't change the fact that my wife and I were heartbroken about this situation.  But, we laid back and let her \"do her thing\" which, apparently, included quitting her job, something we would not have allowed.  (We require our children to work and help support themselves once they are old enough).  Generally speaking, she avoided contact with us, in spite of our efforts to be inviting and friendly.  We did our best to honor her wishes unless she contacted us.  We did get occasional negative feedback from my mother-in-law, which we ignored as best we could.  This was not how we wanted things to go for her, but as a teenager, she apparently knows better.  We were concerned that she would not continue with school (for which she has a full scholarship) or would do other \"dumb\" things.  All we could really do was sit back and wait.  Heck, even when she would come over to the house to see her sisters, she would only do so when my wife and I were not at home.  And, she would sneak away after we came back home.  It has been a distressing few months, to say the least. For many years we've had cats in our home, and our children grew up with those cats.  We had one pass away in late 2016, whom we missed greatly.  But of the two remaining cats, one had been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism two or three years ago.  We had been treating this with medicine and he seemed to have responded well overall.  However, in early October of this year, I found him under the bed of one of my other daughters and when I pulled him out, I realized that something was seriously wrong with him - it appeared he had had a stroke and was paralyzed and blind.  This cat was a much-beloved member of the family, and particularly to my daughters.  We took him to the vet who confirmed what we thought and had him put down.

When they seat you at dinner they put you with strangers so there is a formality of introducing yourself and telling your travel story.

I had a wonderful day for the most part, and we had a lot of fun with our families. However, there was a couple unexpected events that made the day less than perfect. For starters, my MIL was being mean and said some negative things about me to my own father. She was not the only one that caused some issues during my wedding. My husband's aunt decided to take it upon herself to cut my wedding cake. Not only did she cut the cake without asking, she also destroyed the cake and ruining the top tier that my husband and I were planning to save for later for just the two of us. She made a mess out of our special piece, and offered it to guests. When removing our top layer, she dropped in on it's side on another plate. I will never forgive her for what she did, as the cake cutting was something that I had been looking forward to and planning since we first started planning the wedding. Even though it really upset me, I decided I wasn't going to show my anger or make a big scene. My close family knew that it upset me and helped make me feel better. I didn't want to ruin the day completely, so I just decided to continue on with the day and enjoy spending time with the people I actually care about and care about me.

I felt a strong urge to play that day, specifically at that moment. Turns out, that urge was justified, as that was the day I met the person who would eventually become my girlfriend. We've been together ever since. Now, on to the important event. Back in June, I finally had the opportunity to go meet her in real life. Both of us had been waiting for this moment, and it was finally here, and we were very excited. I left on a Saturday evening, the day just before Father's Day, by train. I brought an old laptop with me so we could keep in touch on the way there, since our preferred form of communication is through an online messaging platform called Discord. We talked all night, getting more and more excited the closer I got, even though we were also both growing more and more tired. I didn't get a single ounce of sleep that night, half due to my excitement and half due to the fact that I have a hard time sleeping on trains. Finally, after some delays, I arrived near her home town at roughly 10 AM on Sunday, and started walking down to the local train station to take a connecting train to her home town. After a few more hours, we finally met. Let me tell you... meeting her was far better than I had imagined it would be. Up to that point our relationship had been very intense, and we had become very close, despite our great distance physically. So believe me when I say it was magical when we finally met. I spent the next two weeks with her before I had to come back, and they were the best two weeks of my entire life.

After we arrived, we walked over to our table. Everyone was standing around with their backs turned to us, and as soon as he walked in, they all turned around and yelled SURPRISE and HAPPY BIRTHDAY. I've never seen him look so surprised or excited in his life. He was feeling a bit down about turning 30, and said he didn't want to do anything for his birthday, so the fact that friends came from miles away really made him feel special and supported. His mom's generous gift was to cover all of the drinks and food for the event, so everyone could relax and order as much as they wanted without worrying about money or splitting the bill. Many of his friends brought gifts and cards, but it was them driving the distance that made the biggest impact on him. We recently moved to the suburbs for work, and he has been missing hanging out with his city friends, so seeing them all in one place was really special.", "label": "retold", "group": "A02I5NH4"}

She wanted to go visit her aunt and uncle who we havent seen in a while but we only had a weekend to do it. She bought us 2 train tickets departing at 11:45 PM on friday and we started our 13 hour trek. We got on the train and slept a bit, and woke up around 6. We played some games on the train and grabbed breakfast in the dining car. When we got to the platform my sister was waiting for us and ran up to Elise and gave her a hug. It was nice seeing them and going to their home but there was so much to do and we only had 24 hours. We went to a museum in town and ended up seeing a performance at the local theater where my nephew works. We all grabbed drinks afterward and went back to the house for a fire. It was a whirlwind of a day, but I am glad we did it. Time flew by too quickly and before we knew it we had to rush back to the train station for work. In all the trip was 52 hours with half of it being spent on a train, but I think we would do it again. It was nice spending quality time with Elise and seeing my sister and her husband. Its too bad they moved out of state and we cant see them more.

It involved something that I was hoping that might happen a little later down the line in my career. I guess it was one of those things that really takes you by surprise when it happens a lot sooner than expected. I was pulled aside by my Operations Manager for a little chat. We mainly talked about usual work related stuff and such, nothing too out of the ordinary. He twas telling me about a new position that had opened up for the current lead on the team and that they would be moving on to a different account. I was thought that this was good for them and mentioned that I hope they did well in their new position. My boss then says that it would obviously open up a new spot and that they would need to get someone new to come in. He asked what I thought about this and I just said that I wasn't sure at the moment but that I thought one of my other colleagues could probably step into the position. Then out of no where he just says that he's going to give it to me. At first I thought he was joking but then I saw that he appeared to be serious. I was a little caught off guard by this because I thought that some of the others might be better suited to step into this position. He basically told me that he thought that I had been doing such a good job and that I had shown the ability to do the job. I still felt a little uneasy about it but at the same time I knew that I could take on the challenge if I put the effort into it. I told him that I would gladly accept and that I would do my best.

My incredibly stoic strong girl way whining and in pain.  I told her how much I loved her.  What a good good girl she was.  How much joy she brought to my life.  I asked her to forgive me for waiting.  And I asked her to forgive me for saying goodbye.  After several months I still feel guilty and wonder if I did the right thing, did she understand, did she know I loved her so much, could she feel me petting her sweet face as she went to sleep, did she hear me tell her she was a good, good girl and that I loved her? Could she feel the sunshine on her fur?  Did she know she was on her deck surrounded by trees and birds and squirrels? I hope so.

Since he enjoys staying at hotels, I booked a room at a luxury hotel for a weekend getaway. I did not tell him before we checked-in to the hotel, but I had chosen this hotel because it had a large, heated indoor pool. We got to our room and I immediately opened my suitcase and pulled out his swimming trunks, that I had packed in secret.  We changed into our swim clothes and headed down to the pool. As we approached the pool, we both noticed that there was also a whirlpool located next to the pool. I was elated! My husband suffers from back pain and the whirlpool would certainly made him feel good. We swam for quite a while, then relaxed in the whirlpool. After we got back to our room, we both were extremely hungry and we agreed that a steak dinner was what we wanted. We ate our favorite steaks along with baked potatoes and creamed spinach.  For dessert, my both had the most delicious chocolate cake that we'd ever eaten. After dinner, I gave him directions to a nearby movie theater, where we planned to see a remake of one of his favorite movies, The Lion King. The theater featured state of the art video and sound, but when we entered the theater to take our seats, I was astonished to see that all of the seats were overstuffed leather recliners that changed position with the touch of a button. Again, this made me particularly happy because of my husband's back issues, sitting for long periods of time can be painful for him. I was sure that he would be very comfortable in his seat and would be able to enjoy the movie thoroughly, which he was and he did.  The sound and video quality, along with the comfort of the seats made us decide that we would never go to different theater ever again.

{"id": "3KYQYYSHYWTUK9OIHAPV6ZFRGLKODB", "text": "In the last few months, I discovered who God is for the first time in my life. I first became a Christian when I was eleven years old. It was honestly a traumatic experience for me because I was raised in churches that were, to be bluntly and brutally honest, cruel to my family and me. My parents were ostracized for many, many things, including the fact that my dad had an old navy tattoo and my mom homeschooled us. Were were basically the poster children for teasing and humiliation. As I grew older, my perception of God grew more and more confused. In fact, I developed a true and utter terror of God and Jesus. Churches pounded hell, fire, and brimstone, so I just turned myself over to serve God out of terror. When I became a Christian, I broke because I felt that I was still sinning or forgetting to read my Bible sometimes, or losing my temper. I felt that I needed to be rebaptized since I didn't read my Bible all the time due to forgetting, or the fact that I was going through puberty and would sometimes lash out at my family. I now know that I have PCOS and PMDD, so that explains a lot, but my old self thought I was clearly unregenerate and worthy of hell even in my saved state. I would pray the \"sinner's prayer\" every night out of fear that I wasn't living perfectly enough and, should I die, I would burn in hell. I eventually felt that I lost my faith. After losing my grandmother, my faith in God dwindled away, piece by piece, because I was angry that an all-powerful God could let this horrible thing--this death-- continue when He had the power to stop it. I was going to a very modern church, and I felt even more disconnected because the church never spoke of much of anything except \"self help.\" I felt like I had to leave there, but I was afraid. So I began tearing up the Bible and deep theology, determined to understand God in ways that I never had before. I read words of wisdom from the Bible and great Biblical scholars like Swindoll, McGarthur, J.C. Ryle...I couldn't sleep at night, because, as I was digging deeper, I realized that I never truly understood the Bible until then. Never. I would sleep little, spending late, late hours of the night in study and prayer. It was life-changing because, out of this \"metamorphosis,\" I began to truly connect to God and understand our purpose on this earth. I understood the plan--why Jesus had to die, why His timing for ending the world is perfect, and why we shouldn't fear death if we put our faith in Him. It all began to make sense -- the meaning of baptism, the reason we struggle with sin...God is our advocate to walk with us through it all. We don't have to be perfect -- we strive, we pray, and we constantly crave a deeper connection to our God. It changed me, and I am walking the path to re-baptism because I truly love God and His plan for our lives.", "label": "recalled", "group": "QR10SQ52"}

Unfortunately, at that time, he was uninterested in knowing me or my brothers. Recently though, about 3 months ago, my brother reached out to my Mom and let her know that if my brothers or I wanted to contact him, we could. I ended up messaging him on Facebook and have been talking to him ever since. It's strange how very similar we are and how much we look alike as well. This contact with my estranged brother has brought about MANY emotions that I never knew that I had. Our father passed away in 2014 and talking to my brother has in some ways resurfaced my grief. I've also felt joy, happiness and a feeling of connection with him that I never knew that I could. Also, we ended up getting in touch with each other around the five year anniversary of Dads death and that felt like a punch in the gut. It was my Father who chose not to have contact with my brother and in a lot of ways, I feel terrible for him. My dad was amazing to me and my full blooded brothers but for my oldest brother, Dad was never there and now there will never be a chance for him to make amends to him. My oldest brother would never know the joy that my Dad brought to the people around him. My Dad was an amazing man with many flaws, like us all but he was still caring, intelligent, kind and most importantly, he was my Dad. My oldest brother will ONLY ever know him as the man who was never there for him. As for the most memorable part of this event, it has to be the joy that I have felt reconnecting with my brother as well as the grief and pain. In a lot of ways, he and I are so very similar. We like the same kind of music, we play the same games, we have the same type of humor. My full blooded brothers both take a lot more after our Mom but I look so much like my Dad.

We quickly got ourselves ready at home and hurriedly packed ourselves into our small commuter sedan to start our day. On the way to the mall I asked my daughter, \"what is it like being 7? I'm sure it beats being 6 still!\". Blushing, she responded,\" I'm one step closer to being as old as you mommy! I wanna be just like you one day\". Her response melted my heart, I knew she always looked up to me for guidance and strength during times she wasn't feeling strong spirited, but it was even more meaningful to actually hear her say it out loud. As a single mother of 5 years, I always wanted to be strong for my little girl, and after her dad walked out on us, I knew she needed a strong role model in her life. Therefore, I made it my life's goal to do just that. Once we stopped at the mall in the next town over I started feeling this chest pain again that I experienced for the past two days. It wasn't something I was overly concerned about at the time, but it certainly did cause me enough pain to end the conversation I was having with my daughter.

This has been very stressful for myself, and though he doesn't say it, I know it is disappointing and stressful on my husband as well.  We have been enjoying stability in our home and days where we can simply enjoy being together without having to take care of anyone else. Although my son is 21, and legally an adult, he is very immature and selfish. It's a nightmare having him here again, as an adult. His work shifts have been drastically decreased right now, as he works as a dishwasher in a restaurant here in town -- a town that is very touristy for about 8 out of 12 months a year. Winter is notoriously slow for the industry and while I believe my son should've planned for this and saved his money to be able to afford his rent, he did not do that. So here were are. He is hardly working, not paying a dime to live with us, expects us to care for all of his needs and desires (demands). He still thinks I will wash his dirty laundry and provide all his meals! Maybe I sound callous. Maybe I am. But it's like living with the world's worst roommate... and I should say, I had my fair share of terrible college roommates! Perhaps he will get his act together, find another job that pays enough that he can afford his own place. For now I am not holding my breath.", "label": "retold", "group": "DSAI14HO"}

This was the second time I'd been sentenced to prison time, and hopefully the last! It was a bitter experience, but my day of release was liberating - pun intended - to say the least! I was sentenced to 2 years, 9 months due to an altercation I had with a Milwaukee police officer. I was extremely inebriated during the altercation - from a consecutive days of high DXM abuse - and barely recall any of it. Having been convicted of a same or similar charge in 2013 under identical circumstances, I knew upon sobering up that prison time was guaranteed. It was an awful experience, especially in the beginning. In short, I spent 5 months between the County Jail and the House of Corrections, then a few months in an intake prison, followed by about 6 months at a medium security location, and, finally, the remainder in Racine, where I completed the Earned Release Program to save myself about 9 months of incarceration. My release was exciting, though. G and R picked me up, we went to a dollar store, then to their house to eat and relax. It was endearing and pleasant; they are great friends. This experience has taught me about friendship and integrity, and I feel as though I've become a much better - and more complete - person, as a result. The bus ride from Milwaukee to Charlotte followed; I'd been looking forward to it for over two years! Chicago was my favorite stop, of course, but the mountains in West Virginia and Tennessee are beautiful. It was a long but relaxing bus ride, and this time around I knew that I didn't need to use drugs, as I'd felt in the past.

Three dogs came running from out of nowhere, snarling and growling like they wanted to eat me up.  I tried to ignore them, kept my eyes forward, and walked faster, but they kept coming toward me.  I tried yelling at them, but that didn't faze them either.  Then I tried kind of stamping my foot while yelling.  I'm sure I looked really silly, but I didn't want to stop! They looked really aggressive, and they were big dogs.  I walked faster and started looking around to see if I could tell which house they came from.  I was really hoping their owner would come out and call them off.  Whenever I've encountered dogs before, they usually leave me alone when they realize I've passed their house and don't intend to hurt them.  These dogs, however weren't backing off.  I increased my pace again, but I could tell they were right behind me.  I was starting to panic!  I didn't really want to break into a run, because I figured that would just let the dogs know how afraid I was starting to feel, but I really didn't think I had much choice.  So, I started to run. One of them nipped at the back of my leg, but he didn't really hurt me, thank goodness.  I turned the corner at the end of the street and ran into a gas station that was there.  Thankfully, the dogs quickly lost interest and went back toward the direction they had come from.  The man working in the gas station said that he had seen those dogs before, and that someone really needed to get hold of them before they hurt somebody.

Once we found a place of our own, I had to tell my current roommate about my intentions to move out. I gave her 7 weeks notice, which is quite a generous amount of time given the legal obligation in most states of only 30 days. She had initially received it pretty well, but left abruptly about an hour after I told her. She came back drunk in the middle of the night and proceeded to bang on my door while I was sleeping saying that we needed to talk. She then proceeded to tell me how I wasn't a good friend and how a decent person would have \"given her all the time she needed to find a new roommate.\" Among the laundry list of disparaging comments was the insult that I was effectively screwing her over while she was attempting to extort several months rent out of me. After doing a bit of legal homework, I learned that she had no leverage against me and told her I was only obligated to give her 30 days notice. She blew up my phone with phone calls and text messages insulting and demeaning me and I haven't made direct contact with her since. I had since been staying at my girlfriend's house during the transition and when I first returned to my apartment in the following weeks I found all of my belongings that were in the shared common area had been ransacked and shoved into my room. The irony of this, was that my roommate said that she did not trust me with her belongings, but she felt she had the right to go through my things. Upon inspection, I found that all of my books were removed from the living room bookshelf and tossed onto my bed. Another time I returned to find that all of my kitchen belongings that I intended to pack up were thrown casually on the floor. Later the same night I got a text message from my former roommate saying that she expected me to clear out ASAP despite still being within the thirty day period of rent that I paid for my last month. The situation has escalated to a point where I no longer feel comfortable associating with this person face to face and have taken active measures to avoid her at all costs. The best part of the whole thing was that I was spending considerably less and less time at my apartment and she even admitted to seeing it coming, but she still didn't take active measures and acted out in this manner.", "label": "recalled", "group": "7SXTS1KI"}

He is a perfectionist and usually needs everything to be perfect and just the way he had planned it to be. He does not handle change well. Growing up with him, I remember how he often used to get stressed when we changed plans on him. I knew that his wedding was a big deal for him. He had planned to have a beautiful summer wedding on the river in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The venue he chose was positioned in a perfect location overlooking both the river and the city. He had specifically picked a date in May as he knew that the average temperature during this time was 80 degrees.  However, this precision planning seemed to have backfired on him. That morning I looked outside the window and saw what looked like the coldest and rainiest day in the history of May. There were about fifty people who attended, most wearing summer attire. Families began arriving at the venue and most were still hopeful about having the venue changed.  There were several messages sent out in the family group chat that read, \"What is going to happen with the venue, will it be changed?\" and, \"it is way too cold and wet today, surely this will have to be moved to an indoor venue at least?\".When I arrived at the wedding, I began seconding guessing my cousins decision not to have the venue moved. By then the wind started picking up and it was not a pleasant day at all. The venue as positioned outside next to a river and by then all of the chairs and tables were drenched. Many of the guests began asking about the possible cancellation/relocation of the ceremony. However, my cousin was determined to give his bride the view that she had asked for. To many of the guests amazement, they decided to go ahead and move on with plan A.

I worked so hard to get my degree, struggling while working a job, taking care of two kids, my ex husband and my elderly mother in law. It was such a triumph when I got my degree. About six months ago, I lost my job due to the negligence of another nurse, and because of the belligerent new nurse manager who has had it in for me from day one. His firing of me was, I believe, retaliation for having gone to the union to report him last year. Allow me to explain what happened that caused me to lose my job. I worked in the psychiatric ward. I work, or worked rather, nights, and I am the charge nurse. This means of course that I am in charge. On the job I have my Assistant, or Nurse's Aide, and one other nurse. On slow nights, the hours drag and it can be very boring. On nights such as the full moon, it is pure chaos. The night in question happened to be a slow night, as we had only three patients and all of them were in bed asleep. During the course of the night, a fourth patient was admitted. This woman, in my informed opinion, was not so much having a mental episode, but was high on drugs. She did have some signs of mental illness. She was quiet and sweet, and just sat on the floor near our station counter, drawing artwork. On this particular night my Nurse's Aide wasn't there, and it was only me and the other nurse. I got sick during the night and had to go to the bathroom for an extended stay. The other nurse's job was to cover our station and maintain order. However while I was gone, the patient escaped. The other nurse did not even notice her get up, steal her keys from off the counter, unlock the door and leave. Nothing bad happened to the patient; she called someone from home and they came and picked her up. The next day she called to say that she wanted her cellphone back as she had left it when she escaped.

She had cervical cancer in her 30's and a part of her tumor was taken to see if the cells could be kept alive in culture. It resulted that her cells not only stayed alive, they thrived and reproduced very easily. Her cells are now considered immortal. However, what really touched me emotionally and what was most memorable was reading about how she got cervical cancer. She got cervical cancer due to being exposed to different strains of HPV by her husband numerous times, a fact which was only discovered decades later. Due to that finding, a vaccine was formulated to reduce the risk of cervical cancer in women. Reading that immediately prompted me to read more about the HPV vaccine and it's dosage requirements and effectiveness. I remembered that I had only had one dosage so far. As such, reading about this woman who died as a result of being infected by her husband really made me angry at the fact that there was no way for her to have known this could have happened to her. To me, reading about this woman's life validated the need for me to get my second and third dose of the vaccine although I had gotten the first dose more than 2 years ago. She suffered immensely in the last few months of her life and her family also suffered her loss due to something that in this day and age is preventable. Reading about her story opened my eyes about not just cancer, but HPV and the importance of being vaccinated against it. Due to this book I sought out extra medical information that further educated me about the matter and motivated me to contact my health care provider. It also prompted me to have a conversation with my siblings about it. I know that it is in my hands and that I have the resources to continue my HPV immunizations and after reading this book it seems foolish for me not to.", "label": "recalled", "group": "WRBHBP6A"}

I lost hold of my beer in the excitement, and it flew and hit the back of this lady sitting in front of me.  It was almost a full beer, and all of it went on her shirt.  She was furious, and I was mortified.  She started screaming at me, and at first I was apologetic.  When she continued to scream at me, I told her to \"Fuck off, I already apologized.  What the fuck else do you want me to do?\"  At this point, the guy she was with started getting loud and threatening.  My brother-in-law started jawing back with the guy as well.  Then security started to approach, while we were going back and forth.  When security got there, I explained that it was an accident, and that I was not being drunk or disorderly.  They diffused the situation, and we were able to continue and watch the game.  There were no further disturbances.  We laughed about it after the game, and in hindsight, it was pretty funny, although somewhat unfortunate.", "label": "retold", "group": "7TMQ2XXP"}

When he asked me I was so excited, but as the wedding got closer, I got a little bit nervous. I had never been the best man for anyone before, and I didn't want to mess it up. I rehearsed my speech for weeks leading up to the wedding. I edited it so many times and had all my friends listen to it and let me know what they thought. Nobody had any corrections for me, so I didn't change anything. Instead, I focused on memorizing it. I had a feeling that when I got up on stage at the wedding to say the speech I would forget everything. On the actual wedding day, I brought a copy of my speech in my pocket, just in case. When it came time for me to read my speech, I decided to try it without using the paper. At least until I needed it. It turns out, I had the whole thing memorized and didn't need to reference my notes at all! I was so thrilled to be able to honor my best friend in this way.

During one of the hot evenings we decided to cool down and go through an alley way instead of the main street. We heard beautiful music playing down the alley and saw a band practicing their music for a show. It was a very human experience since I was able to unwind and just listen to the music wafting through the alley. Of different sorts of instruments and a slow strum guitar. The locals said in a heavy accent that they enjoyed us listening while we just cooled down and de-stressed. It was a relaxing and humble experience. Out of all my adventures I find this experience to be the best because I was able to see the side of humanity that is universal and no cultural differences kept that apart. I really liked the feeling it gave me. I think the best thing about the experience was that it made me realize we all are human. It does not matter where we come from.

She would also get back together with her abusive ex multiple times, like my advice did not matter. She would also hang out with people she claimed to hate. She did this out of lonliness. She made me feel used, where before she would invite me to her room all last year to complain about her ex, which I would listen to, when they are both okay after the 4th time getting back together, I was cast to the side. So when she kept avoiding me, I gave it to her straight over text that I miss her friendship and that I did not need this support in my life right now, and that we were growing apart, she lashed out at me. She claimed I was too sensitive and how I was the problem and that we would still be friends if I wasn't so sensitive. She said it in a much ruder tone though. I avoid her now, and I still feel the hurt from all of that. I only wish it could have ended more amicably because thats how I approached her.

To do this, I had to not take the nerve pain medication before making the 2 1/2 hour drive.  I did this, and as the medication left my system, the pain in my arm and shoulder from the healing shingles became overwhelming.  I ended up having to make the drive home again, and doubled up on the medication after I got here to make the intense pain manageable.  For two solid months, I was on either the combination of medications, or just the nerve pain medication.  For two solid months I was unable to drive myself to the doctor, grocery shopping, or anywhere else.  For two solid months, I spent every single day feeling slightly high or drunk!  The nerve pain medication sure made me sleep well though! If I learned anything from this incident, it's how much I can depend on my wonderful roommate!  We have been friends for probably 7 or 8 years now, and have been roommates for almost three.  He is my best friend, my partner on my homestead, and will probably be my roommate for the rest of my life, or as long as I can continue to take care of myself.

This was, of course, always our plan for him and we worked together as a team to make sure he got the grades to get into a good school. I also saved money as best I could to pay for college and we worked together to get him scholarships and grants. I was so proud of him when he got into a college he really wanted to go to, and we spent the summer getting everything ready for him to start this next chapter of his life. A few days before he left I started feeling sad, knowing I would miss him. It's just the two of us, so my house would feel empty. But I was also excited to start my next life chapter. We made the drive to school a fun road trip of a few days to spend some last time together. But wow. Now that he's been gone I can't believe how much I miss him. I'm really crushed to have him gone. I feel kind of guilty about this and hide it from him when he calls or texts to check in. He does miss me, too, of course, which is natural for all kids going off to college. I tell him I miss him, and I actually make up things to tell him that I'm doing (but I'm really not doing them). I stay home and just be sad that he's gone. This is crazy! My whole goal raising him was for him to become a competent adult who would leave me and go off and pursue his dreams, so why am I so darn sad?? Maybe I should go talk to someone? I have things I can do, I just need to get out of the house and do something productive. I'm really looking forward to the holidays when he's back home again. But I think I need to work through these overwhelming feelings and actually start living my new life so we have something to talk about when he's home. He'll have stories for me about college and all of his new experiences and I should be able to hold up my end of the conversation.

Although I was surrounded by a caring family, tragedy struck when I lots my mother at the age of three. I imagine being born into a family of three other siblings , including my twin brother, offered some comfort to this lost.  The ages of my brothers and sisters ranged from fifteen, thirteen and three. This created many challenges for my surviving parent, whose work commitments kept him away from home, often at night. It was decided that my twin brother and I would be split between relatives to relieve the stress created by my mothers absence. This, however difficult it is to imagine created for me a unique growing experience splitting my time between the city and the country. As I reflect on my situation growing up in this environment I realize that it offered me unique benefits, perhaps not experienced by other children growing up in more traditional arrangements. I have always had an outgoing personality and friendliness, generally attributed to a level of patience and flexibility in most social interactions I have with people, personally and professionally. This trait I know comes from leaning at an early age to adapt to change that comes unexpectedly. When my father re-married, I was ten and fell back on my experiences as a younger child to better adapt to yet another chapter in my family dynamic to unfold. Although, at this time I do remember some typical Pre-teen angst, that proved challenging for my father and step mother, my history proved yet again that patience and flexibility rewarded me with a loving and committed new mother whose example of strength and courage played a very important role in my formative years. I often think just how blessed I am to have had 2 mothers, a twin brother and such a loving and unique family dynamic growing up. The most endearing and lasting memories I have are of a transitional nature and not necessarily stability. Whats funny now is that I strive for routine or regularity in my life, whilst always prescribing a degree of patience and flexibility.", "label": "imagined", "group": "Y8O494IX"}

She really didn't see anything she liked for a wedding. I told her it probably was because she wasn't in the mood for love type things right now. My friend said that right now she's not even thinking about spending  money on someone's wedding, she just hated the idea of love. Someone walking by heard us talking and stopped us and told us that we shouldn't lose hope on love. My friend told her that she was just cheated on by her long time boyfriend and for right now men are scum. I started laughing and told the woman to ignore her, she's upset. The woman told us it was understandable, but to not take his actions out on all men. She made a good point about our friend's marriage and how she must have found a great man that wouldn't cheat if she's willing to celebrate her love with everyone else. I was like \"She's got a point!\" My friend said, \"Ok, ok! You got me! We'll go and look for a dress now and I'll be a little less bitter about men...tomorrow!\" and we all laughed and the woman said to go to the dress shop down near Macy's. She said they had great dresses and they were reasonably priced and if we didn't mind dresses that had been worn before, they had great cheap dresses and the owner would probably give us a deal if we liked something but it was out of our price range. I was like \"I don't mind preowned, most of my shopping is thrifted anyway.\" So we go to the dress place, it has so many good dresses and we tried on and liked so many of them. We were helped by the clerk and decided on 3 dresses we loved each and since the prices were great, we were getting all 3 of them. I joked with the clerk that we were told the manager would cut us a deal because some random woman told us about this place. The clerk called to the back and asked if she could give us a deal and the stranger that talked to us came out and said \"Yea, you should cut them a deal. Ring up the cheapest dress and ring them up for that one and let them have the other dresses for free.\" I was shocked but thankful!

I immediately said yes and was shone where to go to get everything prepared. I took care of all the necessary stuff and finally was able to my new little pouch home. I decided to name her maul because something about her personality just brought this name to me.  Well, it took very little time to hit it off and just after a month we've become inseparable.

I called out his name, and we hugged.    We then sat down with our beverages and reminisced.  I recounted how \"in love\" with him I was during our teenage years, holding back that seeing him gave me butterflies.  Even now I feel the fluttering just writing this down.  You see, we are both married, happily, and have children.  Obviously, nothing could happen between us at this point in our lives.  Some feelings just never go away though.

I arrived at said time to pick them up for my ex husband to come outside and tell me that I could not have my boys until later that day because he changed his plans(something of course not communicated to me). I told him that per our agreement we had come upon I was to pick them up by noon and that I was not leaving without me kids. This man then went back inside and slammed the door on my face. Now at this point my boys knew I was there and I could hear them on the other side of the door crying because they wanted to see me and he would not let them.

I said yes right away and quit my job as an assistant manager at a hotel and left for Virginia to work for him. He offered to let me stay in his basement which was just a really nice downstairs apartment. I was very grateful and stayed with him for a year until I saved enough money to get in to my own place. At first I really enjoyed the job and put in my best effort. The two owners, my Uncle and his best friend were very happy with my performance. I was given a 50% raise after only six months on the job. After a year, I was promoted and given another significant raise. After being promoted I was put under the supervision of a new boss. She was very good at her job but unfortunately was not good with the people working under her. She would talk very badly behind our backs and would not think twice about throwing us under the bus if it would keep her from looking bad.

Pains and muscle spasms begin shooting throughout my entire leg but seemed to focus near the inner part of my knee. After making it home, I immediately began RICE. The next few days were literally hell! I couldnt shower, cook food, and could barely make it to use the bathroom. I lived in a basement apt as well at this time and definitely could not make it upstairs to leave. Not that I could drive anyway. Eventually I retrieved a set of crutches that made life so much better! However, I couldn't walk work nearly an entire month and am currently still recovering. Its been about 5 months since the incident. The worst part of it all is that I am a very active and healthy young male. I put a lot of focus on health and well being and understand human anatomy and physiology at a high level. So, without the use of a major limb really puts me in a strange situation.

At least a couple of us enjoyed ourselves a little too much so it was a great idea that we'd decided to Uber from the hotel and back again.

It was pretty busy for being the middle of the summer so we had to wait a little bit, but it was worth it.  They specialize in locally grown and sourced foods and really care about the quality and presentation.  We were happy our friends could experience this on their first trip to the states.

Therefore when an opportunity came to travel to home Mother's Day weekend I decided it was something that I needed to do. Thankfully I was able to request the weekend off from work and thus started to make plans. I then thought about some meaningful gifts that my mom might enjoy. When the work day finally ended on Friday I quickly went home and gathered up the items that I thought I would need for the weekend. It seemed like it took forever to do, but in reality probably only took a few minutes. I then drove several hours to my parent's place and arrived later that night. I was determined to make it in good time so only stopped once for gas along the way. However, it was late at that point we just talked for a bit before everyone went to bed. The next couple days though we went out and did some activities in town. We visited a couple new restaurants as well as one of the local parks.  It was neat to see how much my hometown had changed since I had grown up. The weekend went much too quick, but overall was very enjoyable and memorable.", "label": "recalled", "group": "DKX309E8"}

We knew the struggles the couple had faced so it was even more suitable to be emotional in this moment. However, what my future fiance did not know was the real reason I was so emotional, the real reason behind my happy tears.

He told me that is the reason he wanted me to take the role of the teacher. His believed this experience would help me understand the teachings of the Bible and at the same time benefit the children. After careful consideration, I agreed to teach Vacation Bible School. I must say this endeavor turned out to be one of the best decisions I have ever made. I was assigned to a class of 7-9 year-olds. The children in this age group were inquisitive and full of wonder. I immersed myself fully into each lesson. The decision that I made to undertake this challenge was one of the best I have ever made. I learned more about the Bible during that week than I had learned in my entire life. The children were responsible for opening my mind up to all the things that were confusing to me concerning the teachings of the Bible.  The children had an awareness that I hadn't before this week of teaching. They graciously shared their stories and opinions on the lessons I was teaching. That was one of the best weeks in my life. I am so glad that I participated in the event. My pastor was right about this aiding in my understanding of the teachings of the Bible. During that week of Vacation Bible School, many of the questions that were always pulling at my mind were answered by innocent children.

I recall the day we left for her move in day.  i thought it was going to be tear filled and sad, but there was more excitement and forward thinking on the way out to Buffalo NY.  She was excited to start her new life away from the day to day home life and start moving towards her academic and professional goals in he new life going forward.  We found that she joined a couple of groups at school related to her chosen pre-dental profession and related academics in sciences and math.  She also is involved in a networking group to stay up to date on changes and trends in dental fields and orthodontics.  i'm excited for her and happy to see her drive and ambition so early on in her collegiate career.  As we reflected back on the month or so building up to moving her off to school, my wife and I seemed to realize that our feelings, though justified, were more about how we felt and our anxiousness about her leaving and not really about how she felt and what her ambitions are,  I am glad we found that she was looking forward to this new life and that she was nervous like us but seems to have it under control.  She has a roommate and other friends in the same pre-dental studies and they work well together and have a study group.  That makes me proud as a parent and glad to see that my worries were for nothing and she is so well adjusted to college life.  High school seems so long ago and the strides she has taken in the past couple of months are impressive.  Maybe it is because of necessity but nonetheless she is ahead of the curve related to others I have seen and heard about at her stage of the game.  As parents we have gone from worrying stressed out and nervous people to proud and excited parents.  The transition has been painless and she has led the way without our interaction.  I think the most impressive part is that she is not the same person at school as she is at home.  She is very quiet, sort of lazy, and not proactive at home and it seems she is the ultra opposite away at school.

At that time, we had chatted for a while and then I had gone to visit her in New York City, where she was from, but a few weeks later, the brief beginning to a possible romance ended. I thought about her a lot over the next several months, and finally, about 5 months later, I contacted her again. I didn't know if she would respond, but to my delight, she did. However, emotions and feelings still had to be sorted out and ultimately we took a month or so break from communication again. It was then, in June, while about to take a week-long vacation to the beach with my family -- the travel route of which would take my by the town where she lived while going to school -- that we reconnected and planned to meet up on my way back from the beach. We decided to go to a theme park close by, one that I hadn't been to since I was probably in high school. All week I was excited and a bit nervous. Would this simply be two friends hanging out, or would it be something more? When I finally met up with her, things were a bit awkward at first; it had been a long time since we had seen each other and I was trying to feel out how to act. However, the next day when we went to the park, things were very fun and the conversation between us flowed naturally and easily. We even flirted and made some physical contact. We spent a long day at the park and rode all sorts of rides, and in the time we spend walking around and waiting in line, we talked a lot about each other and grew closer. At the end of the day, we went to her place -- both of us were pretty exhausted. While we were there, we talked intensely about the situation between us and really made a heart-to-heart connection. I told her I had wanted to kiss her all day but wasn't sure if I should. She responded that she had been waiting for me to do so. We sealed the day with a kiss, and since then we've been seeing each other almost every week. I think back to that day a lot as the start of something wonderful.", "label": "recalled", "group": "DY70LV8Y"}

Once we relaxed into our lovely surroundings we chatted for about an hour. We got caught up and re-connected, which was just what I was hoping for. We left with big smiles and satiated appetites. It was a gorgeous day outside. Blue sky, no clouds, slight breeze. So we then decided to take a walk. We thought this might help us digest our enormous intake of food. We found ourselves standing next to a regal movie theater. We looked at each other and just started laughing.  She, afterall, wants to be an actress. Well we just had to go inside to see what was playing.  It made complete sense that after that long walk we had to reward ourselves. In search of the latest and greatest movie we marched inside to investigate this funky little theater. We found exactly the movie we wanted, made our purchase and settled in. Some teenagers were making a tremendous amount of noise and my niece turned around and said: \"leave the theater if you plan to keep that up. Some of us actually are here to watch the movie and we'd like to listen\". She was so direct yet kind -I was so proud of her. They stopped talking immediately.

I realize compared to the risk of riding in a car the chance of a crash happening is statistically lower, but not in my opinion. I do not think something that size has any business being in the air and basically propelled by fire. This is all beside the point because three months ago I had no choice but to get on a plane to attend my company's annual event. This year it was at the state's capitol. I'm glad it doesn't take place at the same location every year, so that's a positive aspect. I rarely visit the capitol so at least a bit of excitement was added to the mandatory plane trip. I would have preferred at least one night's stay in a decent hotel instead of having to fly back on the same day. That is way too much flying for me and maybe even most people. It felt like a waste of resources and there could have been a better, less wasteful alternative to the entire event. It's difficult to say whether or not I had a good time considering I spend the entire day being anxious about traveling on two different airplanes. If the annual event next year is two plane trips in one day, I may have to find a way out of it. I don't think I could handle another stressful travel day like this one. Speaking of stressful, my nerves were so shot from the traveling I decided once I landed I needed a stiff drink or several to take the edge off. Thankfully I arrived home safely and as soon as I got off the plane, I was calling my best friend. I didn't want to go out for a drink alone. Luckily she was considering going out for a few drinks anyway and hadn't found anyone to go with. We met up at our favorite local bar and had quite a few drinks.

Maybe when they get older they'll be healthier and continue to grow their gardens and even pass the tradition down to their kids. At this year's garden giveaway they had a Big Seed contest. The charity gives the seeds to the local schools who give them to the students. Each year it's a different seed. The students are encouraged to grow the plant at home (this year it was watermelon) and bring it to the Garden Giveaway and enter it in a contest for biggest plant.

I asked her \"whats up\", she huffs on how I'm such a procrastinator and she's doing all the cleaning because Tasha is ghosting her.  I asked Sally, what are you talking about?  Did we get robbed? Where's all your stuff? and then \"Oh, didn't Tasha tell you, that we have to be out of the apartment by Tuesday?\"  Honestly, my jaw dropped.  I don't know why it did, its not like Tasha was the best roommate, her communication sucked.  So here it is Sunday night and I'm panicked.  I clearly did not plan on moving and now I have a 24 hour window to find something!

I texted my parents to, my dad said it was a blessing in disguise.  Sally did all the cleaning and Tasha was already gone, so I just had a small section to pack up.  My dad is always very calm and reassuring, it helped.  I don't know why I hadn't panicked yet, I mean there was a rumored housing shortage both on and off campus.

Phil was offering me, his studio, his landlord agreed to a small rent increase, but it was a still a screaming deal and I was ecstatic.  I spent the whole day, filling up my small car with boxes, to and from storage.  I only packed what I, myself could carry.  My arms and shoulders hurt, my legs hurt from all the up and down motion.

He was thrilled when he was accepted in to the program, and I was happy and proud.  However I was also nervous and sad. While I am exicted for him and the opportuniy he has in front of him over the next year, it still hurts to think of him being so far away.  The idea of \"losing\" someone I am used to seeing every day, that I won't be able to help him if he gets sick or hurt, hat we won't be able to take a walk together, or throw a ball, or share a soda, or just talk... leaves me with an empty feeling inside.

My husband and I had a joint checking and savings account that we had our checks deposited into. I had gotten paid the day before, and I was at work when I got a call from him on my break. He said that he saw a Black Friday Sale at Kohl's, and wanted to buy a Playstation 4. I said okay, but he left the part out where he was going to take my paycheck that was deposited the day before to pay for it. So when I checked my account later on, I saw that he already transferred and withdrew a majority of my paycheck (around 400 dollars) to buy the PS4 on Black Friday. That paycheck was to go toward the bills that I was responsible for, and to buy the kids Christmas gifts. I spoke to him and got him to wait until he got paid to actually buy the PS4 with his own money instead of  knowingly using the money that was allocated to something else. Overall, I felt betrayed and hurt. I was also confused because, in my opinion, normal people don't do things like that. He tried to justify it by saying that we could play on it too. There have been a few other instances of things like this happening, but the Black Friday PS4 debacle was one that was really notable for me. I think it's because so many parents go through a lot of trouble to make sure that their children actually get gifts for Christmas, instead of taking money away and spending it on themselves. Now I have my own personal checking and savings account, and have been contributing to bills, and buying Christmas gifts for the kids months in advance. As far as my husband is concerned, I've been adding a few small gifts into the grocery list (we use a pick up app) so he is still financially contributing to buying Christmas gifts for the children without actually having to go out and do it.", "label": "retold", "group": "Q5WH99GE"}

The man was rude, vicious, and had it in for the current staff, especially the older nurses such as myself, of whom he was overheard saying, \"The older nurses are the hardest to BREAK.\" He made many extreme rules that were almost impossible to follow in a rushed, frenzied environment where patients as well as nurses have to be ready to act at a moment's notice. Our patients lives as well as our own could be in danger if we are unable to act quickly. But this fool had us locking doors and drawers behind us each and every time even when manic patients were acting in dangerous or aggressive ways, or when their health was in grave danger. How can one stop and lock three doors behind them when one of the nurses is being strangled by an aggressive patient? He also forbade us from taking breaks- any breaks- even to eat. Well one night I absolutely needed to take a break. I left the other nurse in charge. While I was out, one of the patients escaped. She left of her own free will and was not harmed. She even called the hospital the next day asking for her cellphone back, and she made a statement that she left of her own free will. She said she stole a set of keys to escape. She described the OTHER nurse, who still had her keys. I also still had my keys, and it is shown on the video that we both had our keys. I believe the other nurse was negligent because the patient escaped on her watch, even though I also broke the rules. We both got fired.

It all started a little after she was first born, something just didn't feel right about her. But all the doctors assured me that she was fine and I was just an anxious new mother; it was so frustrating to be continuously turned away when in my heart I knew something was wrong. Finally after seeing dozens of doctors, I finally found someone who would actually listen to me and run a few test on poor little Kyla, low and behold she had a tumor on her lung that was interfering with her breathing. I felt releif, joy, and utter fear when the told me this; finally I had and answer and I was being taken seriously but this was not the answer I wanted for my 6 month old baby. The next thing out of the doctors mouth as even scarier, \"We will have to wait to do anything about it, until she is a little older and can handle the surgery better, if we go in now to remove it we could kill her on the table.\"WHAT!!!!!!!!! I felt like my world was coming down and there was nothing I could do, I am suppose to be her guardian and protector of all things and now I have to wait and sit on my hands until further notice. So for the next several months we kept going to the doctor and he would run his test to see if she was strong enough yet. The day before her 1st birthday we got the clear. She was strong enough!!!! Again so many emotions flooded through me. We already had a big birthday planned for the next day to celebrate with family and friends. I announced the next day our big news that she was strong enough now. We has such a wonderful day that day and she was showered with love and joy and prayer to keep her safe on the operating table. Then last week came and went so quickly. We arrived early in the morning and checked in. I gave my sweet beautiful girl all my love. Then we waited what seemed like hours and hours of sheer terror and boredom and hope all mixed into one bag. Noon rolled around and the nurse at the front desk encouraged us to eat something, so we did. When we came back the surgeon was also entering the waiting room looking for us.

Date number two was at a place she suggested: a pub which featured board games to rent. She decided on Trivial Pursuit and we played a game. I feel like my behavior during the game might have turned her off, as she later said she thought we should be friends.

Even though she had been doing a lot better and in rehab I still got that feeling that it was about her. Sure enough my dad told me my Maw Maw had passed away early that morning. My heart pretty much broke in half when I heard those words. My Maw Maw was the best person I have ever met. She was loving to everyone and always put others before herself. She was married to my Paw Paw for over 50 years and he had passed 4 years prior to this so after he passed her health started going more down hill. She never smoked a day in her life or drank so I will always question why she was taken so soon and  young from me but I know she hadn't been the same since my Paw Paw passed, he was her rock and she loved him with all her heart. After I got the call I started searching for flights immediately. I had planned to fly out a week and a half later anyways but had to move up  my flight to get out there for the funeral. I ended up getting a flight for 2 days later and my mom was planning the funeral for that Friday, I flew out early Tuesday morning. It was nice to get home to family sooner than I had thought I would and see everyone but a very important person was missing.  My oldest son is 8 and he was pretty heart broken too knowing he wouldn't see her again. He was stronger than me though and able to look at her at the viewing and tell her goodbye. That stuff is hard for me, seeing a dead body and the person not being inside of it anymore. The viewing and funeral went very well though. It felt very rushed because her house was also set to close before she passed so we had to clean it out fast for the new owners to move in and throwing stuff away then trying to find a place for the rest was hard. I don't like just throwing her stuff away but we were pushed on time and really had no choice. My parents live in Georgia, me in Texas and Maw Maw lived in North Carolina so not really anywhere to put stuff other than my uncle's house which he has a lot in his garage now.

I have a fear of speaking in public, but I wanted to do itso badly that I committed myself to doing it anyway. During the funeral, a religious gentleman who had come to know him recently gave the service and eulogy. After he finished, he did not ask if anyone would like to say anything - the attendees started getting up and moving around - I immediately went up and asked everyone for a few moments for me to say some words. During this time, I was afraid I was being inappropriate, but I really wanted to honor my grandfather. I waited a few moments for everyone to go back to their seats. Most all sat back down, and a few stood attentively where they were at. I spoke my tribute to him and afterwards I was pleasantly surprised by how much it was appreciated. People rushed up to give me a hug and thank me. I felt so happy that it was both appreciated and that I pushed myself to do it regardless of how doubtful I was about doing it.", "label": "recalled", "group": "N5XMP64Q"}

I should be getting my drivers permit pretty soon but my parents aren't exactly thrilled for me to be driving soon. I can understand, it has been a traumatizing experience for me as well. But I know they could use the help with running errands and taking my little sister to school. My brother was always so helpful, he was like superman. Captain of the basketball team, on the honor roll, popular and still made time to help us with homework and getting where we needed to be when mom and dad were working long hours. Ever since he died things have been quiet at home. We try not to being him up much and when we do, we smile and then immediately get saddened that we can't hear just one more joke. He and a few friends had been involved in an accident with a drunk driver who is now in prison, this wasn't his first DUI but we are praying it is his last. I hope they put him away for a long time. My brother's life wasn't the only one that was lost that night. Two other individuals from his basketball team were in the car with him, twins to a single mom who lives just down the street. I see her from time to time when I ride my bike around the neighborhood. She looks sad, lonely. I know just the feeling. My brother was the only one who didn't make me feel invisible.

He could find no illness or injury. Over the coming weeks she became progressively weaker until she was unable to walk. Her breathing was increasingly labored. I delayed the decision for as long as I could. On June 22, I carried her, bed and all, to the car and drove her to the vet.

She has dementia, and it wasn't until early November of 2018 that I was informed about how bad it was really getting. During most of 2018, I wrestled with Medicaid to try and get her the help she so desperately needed. First, I had to try and find her paperwork, which was very hard as with dementia she didn't keep things. Then, her application was denied because she made $200 too much. After retracing my steps and talking with some people in the main office for my state, I found out  about the waiver program and worked for four months with her social service rep. What made it especially hard was that I live over 200 miles away. I was very thankful that my aunt was nearby to help as much as she could. During this time, there were a lot of issues in that my mother still had her car and was forgetting how many glasses of wine she would drink at night. Finally, after so much work, we received the news in August that she was eligible and accepted into the Home and Community Based Services aging waiver. I remember nearly crying as I received the news from the social service rep. The program meant that she wouldn't have to drive anymore, and that she would have in-home aides and care (non-skilled) for as long as she was able to remain at home safely. Even though it is still incredibly tough, emotionally and logistically, we now have someone there are least 6 hours every day to keep an eye on her and make things so much easier on both me and my aunt. We no longer struggle alone, and my mother now has the care she deserves. The struggle will not end, but we have a service coordinator who is incredibly sweet. He is attentive to our needs and tries to navigate the ever-changing system for us.

I looked down, terrified that a rat had just touched me, but instead I saw a fluffy, furry tail disappearing under my car.  I was afraid that my impulsive reaction may have caused the animal to run away. I knelt down and saw a small kitten, wet and shivering as it leaned against my rear wheel. The kitten appeared to have been someone's pet because it had a small collar around its neck. However, it also looked like it was injured because one of its paws stuck out at an odd angle.  I wondered how I would get this kitten out from under my car without scaring it away.  I remembered that I just bought some snacks and groceries for myself that may entice the kitten and make it trust me.

She is on Medicaid, which it turns out is very good for breast cancer, so there have been no issues getting treatments and getting them covered. She had to have a single mastectomy (a double was refused by Medicaid), followed by radiation, followed by chemotherapy. She is now in the last round of radiation. She still has a wound in her chest from surgery, and a ton of side effects from chemotherapy and radiation. It turns out the side effects can be pretty rough, or else my aunt is having an especially bad time of it. She has had: loss of hair, ulcers in mouth, loss of toenails, extreme acne on the scalp, general discomfort, tiredness, nausea, and other awful side effects. But the worst one was getting pneumonia. Apparently, you\u2019re more susceptible to getting it during cancer treatments. So overall, she is having a pretty rough time of it, and so are multiple family members who are helping her through this by taking care of her, buying and preparing food, handling household tasks for her, and driving her between appointments. But everything was still proceeding about as well as can be expected, in these circumstances. Until this last weekend. Her ex-husband was released from jail. Their relationship ended so long ago, I didn\u2019t even know he was in jail, or what crime he committed. But upon his release, he went over to her apartment. She, thinking he came in friendship, let her in. And he beat the crap out of her, for no reason anyone knows. The beating was severe enough that on top of everything else she has going on, she is now beat up to the point of having broken ribs. He also stole her phone, and threatened to kill her. The police haven\u2019t found him yet, and we don\u2019t know what to do.", "label": "recalled", "group": "149N9GP4"}

When Miley Cyrus sang \"I came in like a wrecking ball\", I don't quite think she really knew what that meant, considering this sweet baby that I had delivered, had done in a physical sense. I woke up that morning and my sister and I were about to go shopping for some of her baby shower decorations when she tells me that she does not feel very well. We weren't expecting for the baby to come for another four weeks, so neither one of us detected that she was actually having contractions, especially considering they didn't really feel like contractions to her. She decides to lie down for a little while to see if maybe a little rest would help her feel better. Well, a few hours later she thought she needed to use the restroom so she got up, and she felt something really strange. By this time she calls me into her room and as I'm walking in she starts screaming that the baby's head is crowning already so I call 911 to get an ambulance on it's way, but the baby was coming way too quickly. I rush to gather some towels at this point because I just already knew that this baby was coming fast. I get my sister laid back on her bed and have her hold her legs up. At this point more of the baby's head is showing. The 911 operator is calmly telling me what to I need to do, but I'm still freaking out a good amount so I put the phone on speaker so that I can do exactly as they tell me to do. I counted with my sister and helped her with her breathing and pushes, and after three long pushes, out comes this baby. At first he's really quiet so I really start to freak out, but as I wrap him in the towel and rub his back, he let's out this strong wail. I pass him over to my sister and just about the time the 911 operator is telling me what else I need to do after this point, the paramedics knock on the door.", "label": "recalled", "group": "EDD7UA09"}

Naturally, she took a worldly view of it rather than read the entire book to understand the context. I was able to explain what the snippet she shared actually meant. She rarely listens when I am able to share something with her like this, but she was the one who brought it up so I did have her attention.

My children are 10, 7, and 3 and they are entering the 5th, 2nd, and preschool grades. There was something that made my 'inner mom' proud to see my children growing and getting to that next step of not needing me anymore and wanting their independence instead. But at the same time, I felt like there was a sense of emptiness as they all eagerly skipped off to their bus. My older school-aged children was excited to see their friends after not really seeing them the entire summer and swapping stories on what they did and showing off their new clothes/school supplies. I was very happy for them and even secretly relived for them to get out of the house for a little bit. I was even more excited to hear about their day, their classrooms, their teacher, and the new friends they might have made! It was very cool to watch them grow up and I couldn't be more excited for them. However, the child that really made my heart sad was my three year old as he was starting school for the very first time. I most definitely took it a lot harder than he has as he did not even stop to say goodbye. Just watching that interaction made me realize that he is in such a hurry to move forward in his life and I am trying to hold back the leash, so to speak. I had a tough time letting go of the toddler stage and letting him go onto the preschool stage. It really was tough to see him SO happy to leave me while I stood back and watched him explore his classroom. Of course it was kind of tough not to take it very personal - I was hoping he was secretly wanting to stay with me... but he didn't. And then I realized that this is his first step towards independence and the very first steps towards the rest of his life. As he goes through different stages, he will always need me even if he doesn't show it. The last child is tough because that is 'your baby.' I will admit, however, having a few free hours to myself was amazing. After school was over, I picked him up and he was all smiles and he couldn't wait to do it again.

I was really happy and grateful to all the people that took out a moment to spare a dollar or two for me. It may not have been much individually, but when you get hundreds of people, everything adds up. This experience taught me that despite all the pessimism in the world today, there are still good people. Moreover, it shows that every little thing can count, since they can add up over time until the proverbial molehill really does become a mountain.

In the beginning, he was not very dedicated to his studies as they didn't have to follow a typical 8 hour school day.  They were given their assignments and test dates and they just had to finish by the time the rest of the class graduated.  Seeing how he didn't seem to care all that much, we had pretty much resigned ourselves to the fact that he would end up having to get his GED because it wasn't looking all that good.  To my surprise, my brother called me a day or two before and said that he had not only finished his studies but that the Principal had decided to let him walk with his class afterall.  I don't have kids of my own so he and his sister are my whole world.  My niece was a straight A honor student who was in drama and on the dance team at school.  She was in advanced classes from the time that she was 6 and it always came easy for her.  She received a scholarship to a 4A well known college.  I think that my nephew always felt like he had to live up to that and that just wasn't the case.  She was a freak of nature and nobody could be like her.

It was by far the longest I've ever spent on a train, and I was super happy to finally get off in Denver, but the ride wasn't so bad. It's way more comfortable than flying because the seats are bigger, with lots of legroom and you can get up to walk around. They even have an observation car with giant windows, although it was usually crowded. Nobody was sitting next to me, so I had tons of room. And there was free wi-fi, so I watched Netflix and did all the normal things on my computer that I would have done if I was at home. All in all it was a pleasant ride. When I got to Denver, I had a few hours to kill before I could check into my hotel room. So I decided I would walk the 5 miles from the train station to the hotel. There just happened to be a nice bike/walking path along a creek that covered most of the distance. It wasn't in a hurry and it was a hot day, so I took my time. I saw lots of breaks to sit and watch the cyclists and joggers pass by. When I finally got to the hotel, I was pretty sweaty and red in the face, and I still had a little more time to kill. So I found a bathroom and freshened up and relaxed in the lounge for a bit. Then I checked in and went to my room. From a quick internet search I saw that there were about 5 dispensaries all within walking distance from my hotel and I could see 3 of them from my room. So I picked the one that had the best reputation and went to buy legal cannabis for the first time. When you first walk into the dispensary, it looks like a boring waiting room. You give your ID to someone and then they buzz you into the main room where everything is for sale. Then you assigned a \"budtender\" who helps you choose what you want to buy.

Its usually common proceedure to do at least a strobe light test on someone with seizures to see if its epileptic or non epileptic, this doctor did a 20 eeg of me taking a nap. My main triggers are stress, they kept trying to convince me my activity would still be abnormal if I had epilepsy which is not what I had heard.

My step-daughter Julie and her husband took me and my husband out for lunch at a fancy little restaurant in town. I was excited to try this place out because I had never gone there before. I was so happy to be able to spend the day with my step-daughter, I hadn't seen her in a while. When we got to the restaurant we sat down and ordered drinks and appetizers. I noticed Julie and her husband kept glancing at each other during the meal, I just thought they were being silly. After the food got to the table then both put their forks down and said they had something to tell us. I was nervous because I thought something bad had happened. Julie had cancer several years ago and I always worry that it will come back. Imagine my surprise, and relief, when they told me they were expecting a baby! My first grandchild! I nearly fell out of my chair. I have always wanted a grandchild. Julie was told many years ago that she would most likely struggle with fertility as a result of her cancer treatment, so we never really expected her to be able to have a baby. This was the greatest news that anyone could have ever given me. My husband and I smiled for a week it felt like afterwards.", "label": "imagined", "group": "KYGR8HVW"}

We thought the bad weather would avoid us and stay to west of our location. Instead, the storm intensified and overtook us on the road. My husband was driving while I was paying attention to the weather app on my phone. Our three teenage sons were in the back seat. The oldest was particularly upset every time he saw lightning. It was slow driving at times because the rain became so heavy that it was difficult to see the road plus the other cars kept slowing down.         Once we arrived in the other city, we started to head to our destination, but took the wrong exit because we couldn't see the road signs. Our phones started beeping with an emergency alert. A tornado warning had been issued for the area we were in. My oldest son began to really panic. We pulled into a convenience store to determine if the tornado had touched down and where. We also wanted to see how close we were to the party location.        We stayed there for a bit until the radar on the weather app showed that the main part of the storm was well past us. My son had calmed down by this point. We got back on the highway and took the correct exit (which was the one right after the one we mistakenly took). Within minutes we were at the party place. We meet up with the rest of the group and watched one of the televisions in the place. The news coverage showed there had been a funnel cloud that touched down near where we were at. Every one was relieved to be safe inside. Once the sun came out and the storm warnings were canceled, my boys and the other teens played laser tag and raced go-carts.

Since my son-in-law's family historically only produces boys, they were not surprised when their first child, Braxton was a boy.  So going into the most recent ultrasound even the doctor assumed that they would learn that the twins were both boys as is the tradition in their family.

The doctor indicates that the girls can be safely delivered anytime after 35 weeks into the pregnancy.  With a projected due date of January 20th, it is possible that our family could welcome the babies yet in 2019.  This would be an added blessing of two additional tax deductions on the Federal Income Tax Filing.

I suppose we could have just driven to the concert on the day of the concert, but it's just so much more fun to go together and take the shuttle once we're there. Anyway, we made the caravan and got to the hotel about 9 p.m. on Friday, and had rooms across the hall and next door to each other. We had pizza and stayed up and watched movies and room hopped. I haven't done that in years. It was a good time to reconnect with a couple of people I hadn't really talked with much in a while, as well. Saturday we slept in, or tried to -- I got up early and went down and ordered coffee and bagels, etc. for everyone and had them sent up.  Someone had already ordered our spots on the shuttle, so after we all got organized, we shuttled over about an hour and a half before the concert. That's the way to do it! No waiting in the lines for hours, and no walking the long way. I suppose I don't mind not doing that as much as I get older -- it would have been a cinch 20 years ago, but I sure don't mind the 'old peoples' bus' now!  The concert was fantastic! I was glad to be in a space where the people weren't all filming it as much with the cell phones -- I feel like everyone misses the show doing that. It's just not my thing, I guess.

I'd always been self-serving and self-centered but I was just playing the part of the leader of the family.

After she lost the ability to walk to diabetes we moved her to a nearby nursing home that specialized in employing caretakers that spoke our native language. There weren't many choices and my father worked hard to get her into this particular one which was highly regarded in the community. We visited her at least once and often two or three times a week to bring her meals to help her adjust. Unfortunately she never quite adjusted to the loss of freedom and autonomy. This went on for about four years and despite how routine it was every visit was different. Sometimes she'd have conflicts with other residents and sometimes with nurses and caretakers. She changed rooms five times during her stay which I believe was more than anyone else has. Every attempt to make things better seemed to have made some things worse. I simultaneously feared going back every week and got terribly anxious being away. Probably the biggest challenge was getting her to eat enough. She hated the food so we tried to bring her home cooked meals as often as we could but this only made her dislike the nursing home's food even more. We kept her fridge fully stocked at all times but because she hated the nursing home food so much she felt the need to save food from home for a later time. Early this year after a particularly bad illness she stopped eating altogether and had to be forced. She passed away a few months after that. She was hospitalized to find the issue and when they found cancer in her liver they determined that there was nothing they could do. We visited more often for a few weeks before that and we were with her when she passed. It shocked me how quickly everyone expected to act. The funeral was arranged within the next half hour and the nursing home pressed us to clean out the room. The wake and funeral came quick and everyone in our small family that didn't seem to care much until now seemed to care a lot.

She told me a few days ago that she is really falling for me, but is not sure if she can be in a relationship with me because it terrifies her that I'm with someone else at the same time. I have a lot of feels about this because I know that I am falling for her too and would love to pursue things more, especially since the relationship is so new, but feels so right and good.  I think the other complicated factor and layer is that I am also struggling with my sexual orientation. I had originally asked my partner to go poly with me because I needed to figure out who I was, and I had not dated that many people in general: guys or girls. I could tell he was really sad when I told him, but he was extremely supportive. On top of that, we were planning a wedding/partnership committment at this time, so we almost called that off. We ended up getting committed (we aren't legally married) in June. Everything has been so confusing, and I am feeling quite a breadth of different emotions. I really want to work things out with my girlfriend, but know that there is so much that she needs to figure out. I honestly feel like I could love her because we connected so amazingly. And, I know that she too is falling for me and that her heart is heavy right now. I also know that I need to respect her process. I tried to reassure her that we could do all the things that partners do, like meet my family and plan trips. She seemed very open to that, but also that she feels really sad and terrified. I really hope that things work out.", "label": "recalled", "group": "BJPFEJVQ"}

The pain increased as the size increased. I went to the Emergency Room twice during that period of time. Xrays, ultrasound and an MRI were done to rule out a break, blood pooling or infection. Everything checked out and I was told that it would take time for the hematoma to dissolve and patience would be needed. A third trip to the ER in July included being admitted to the hospital for observation. At that point an infection needed to be ruled out. Surgery was being talked about to drain the blood. In the end the surgeon decided that it wasn't absolutely necessary to drain it but he could do it if I decided that this was what I wanted. I decided to pass on the surgery and to continue to allow it to naturally dissipate. As it was very painful, I continued to ice it and wrap it with an Ace bandage.

The lymph nodes did not go down, but instead more started swelling.  Our regular doctor put him on a second, more powerful antibiotics.

Lymph nodes from groin to neck were all swollen. Our doctor told us he was 85% certain he had cancer. Not just cancer, but an extremely aggressive cancer.

That is, until three weeks ago when a male student I am particularly fond of approached me before class and shared a personal situation that is causing him much anguish, making it difficult to concentrate on what's happening in the classroom and on his studies in general. He clearly came to me for comfort and reassurance, which I deeply felt moved to provide. Then he did such an odd and alarming thing, it has stayed in my mind and worried me ever since: he gave me a photograph of himself. He said he wanted me to have it \"to remember him by.\"  Now I often find myself lying awake at night wondering if he just wanted me to remember him after my practicum is finished and I am no longer in his classroom, or if there is some darker, more ominous message in his gesture. There was a time in my life when I was so despairing I thought I couldn't go on living. Fortunately there was a very kind and wise psychologist who worked as a counselor at my high school and I had the presence of mind to take myself to see her. I credit her with helping me not only stay in school, but keep my grades up, study for the SAT, and send in my college applications. Having access to help can make all the difference in a young person's life. I have placed his photo on the mirror that hangs above my dresser, where I see it every morning and evening. Each time I wonder, could he be contemplating suicide? Surely I am being alarmist and reading too much into it, yet, the question will not go away.  I ask myself, what is my responsibility in this situation? Most importantly, how would a truly great teacher handle this? Finally, last night, after lying awake yet again with worry, I made the decision to speak to his teacher, in confidence, about the incident and my concern. I will ask not to tell him that I said anything or to do anything that would cause him to suspect I had, but I realize that may prove difficult. In the end, what matters is making sure he is safe from self-harm and has someone to talk to and a place to get help. I also hope to learn from this teacher, who has impressed me with her teaching style, how a good teacher manages such delicate matters as a student with a serious problem outside the classroom.

I couldn't even take my wife because someone needed to be with my kid, so I was essentially going alone when compared to this vast network of friends that were totally hip and cool that my brother has met over the years. Regardless, I did decide to attend and I road into town with my aunt. We had a great conversation, actually, and it was very pleasant. I did also meet a couple that were friends of my brother and they felt similarly outcast.  The location was a rooftop bar and it was nice enough, but way too nice for someone like me who is not used to this luxury. The niceness of the bar alone was enough for me to feel as if I were a total outcast. This is my brother's lifestyle right now, though, so it made good sense to him and his fiancee.

Leading up to the appointment, my mother had been getting quite a lot of uncertain information. She started out with a soreness in her throat, but the initial tests she went through didn't find anything. Then some nodes started to develop on her neck, and she went in for a biopsy to find out what they were. They found thyroid cancer. So, she was called in for further scans (I apologize, but I can't remember exactly what kind now) and the diagnosis quickly escalated from a fairly treatable version present in her thyroid and surrounding lymph nodes to a rapidly growing tumor that was threatening her airway. That was when the meeting that I described came in. The scans happened on that Monday, and on Friday we were sitting in a doctors' office with so many specialists there that they couldn't all fit into the room. My father and I went with her to the appointment knowing generally what we were going to hear. We had a little trouble finding the right place to go, but we still got there early. A nurse took some readings first while we waited. Then a doctor came in and started going over the past events with her to make sure that they had everything right. My father and I sat off to the side mostly for moral support but also to take notes and chime in with questions, reminders, or clarifications. There was a knock on the door, and quite a few doctors filed in. They milled about a little trying to find places to stand without crowding anyone. Then they introduced themselves and their specialties explaining how they might be involved in the process ahead. They explained what they had seen and what it meant too. One doctor set up a camera to go into her nasal cavity so they could observe the tumor breaking into her airway in real time. They talked amongst themselves and explained to us what they were seeing. Another doctor did a quick swallow study having my mother do some vocal exercises and swallow water and applesauce to see what would happen. Eventually most of the doctors filed out except the radiologist who introduced herself. She explained that she would be leading the radiation treatment which was the first step, and we learned what that would involve.

But, we were going to be there for five days and four nights, so I knew I had time to make a decision. I finally decided that I wanted to take her out to a quiet part of the beach at around sunset and propose to her close to the water. This is a little cliche, I know, but she always told me she never cared how or where I proposed. I was wearing shorts that allowed me to easily conceal the ring in my pocket so she would never know. Also, I managed to get a local photographer to take pictures of the moment which I had to coordinate very carefully so my girlfriend would not know. We were walking along the beach and as we were doing so I could feel my heart pounding faster and faster as I knew the moment was coming. It was as if every moment and happy memory in our lives over the past eight years had come down to this. In my mind, I knew with absolute certainty that she would say yes, so I finally took her hand and faced her, with the wind whipping up small waves and the sun setting behind us.

There are no girls in our family over those 3 generations. The day that we had the revealing ultrasound was one of the happiest days of my life. The day she was born was the best and it was unimaginable how it would change my life. I am so thankful and grateful for having her. I couldn't imagine life being any other way. The amount of love that I never imagined having blew me away. When she was brought out, I remember the look she had. It was almost as if she was looking at me and could see every notion of my being. I know she couldn't see, but it sure felt like it. Her eyes were looking directly at me and she didn't whimper one bit. That day is a day I could never forget. It was the most beautiful and captivating face I have ever seen. My daughter who looked exactly like me.

Celebrating one's birthday whether it be a first birthday, a thirteenth birthday, a sixteenth birthday, a twenty first birthday or an fiftieth birthday are all often substantial and considered to be an  accomplishment.  Birthdays may just be any other day in any other culture but, the American culture does more to celebrate one's day of birth and often celebrates them by going over the top. A birthday, commonly known as an occasion, is a celebration of the day of which a person was born. my 31st birthday was 2 months ago, i woke up that morning not being happy, i was broke and i didn't have money on me and this made me really sad. this day happen to fall on a weekend and i usually like celebrating my birthday but since i didn't have money i just decided to stay inside my room all day watching tv. it was almost four pm i was fast asleep, i got a call from my friend Dave. Dave was my housemate, he came inside my room, made me dress up and i thought we was taking me out. we got to the rooftop condo in my city aand as i entered through the door, i saw balloons and other decorations, i was surprise as if my tongue was tied. my friends and family well all present there/ my partner was also there. as i took a step further everybody yelled happy birthday.

On my actual birthday I woke up and I was sad because nobody had done anything for me yet, and I really felt like everyone had forgotten about me. I was so upset that I told my family I was going out to do some errands but I ended up just driving to the target parking lot and sitting in my car and crying for a good thirty minutes. When I finally gathered myself together enough to drive back home, it was already dark outside. I pulled into my garage and didn't even notice all the cars that were parked outside my house. When I walked in the back door, at least twenty people jumped out of nowhere and yelled \"SURPRISE!\". I was so shocked that I started crying again. I thought that everyone had forgotten about me, but my daughter had secretly been planning me a surprise party all along. We ended up having a nice potluck dinner with everyone and had cake and my favorite flavor of ice cream. I was so thrilled that my daughter had taken the time to arrange all of this. I can't believe how silly it was that I was crying in my car just moments beforehand. I will not remind my family of my birthday again next year and see what happens.

The exam went for several sessions over two days. So before each session I had to listen to many of the same security instructions before each part of the exam. But it slowly got less nerve-wracking as I got used to the exam instructions. During each session though the questions were still incredibly hard. But at the end of each session I was happy because I felt like I had completed another big part of the exam. After the last session of the exam I felt so happy.

After days of having tests conducted on me, the doctor concluded that I was suffering from Crones Disease. The doctor told me that this was a severe disease that would impact my life in many ways.

Dealing with maternal cancer can cause distress and anxiety because this illness is usually associated with poor prognosis, agonizing pain, negative effects of the treatment, and low survival rates. Cancer is considered by many as a \u201csilent killer,\u201d which unsuspectingly ravages the body from within. It can be a stressful experience, not only for the patients themselves, but also for the entire family. Every member of the family, especially the children, has to adjust to the emotional burden, physical demands, and lifestyle changes which cancer brings about. The occurrence of cancer has alarmingly increased throughout the years, affecting and claiming many lives around the world. It has been estimated that around 12. 2 million people are diagnosed with cancer worldwide (American Cancer Society, 2007). It is also projected that the number of cancer cases and deaths will continue to escalate in the future. New cancer cases are estimated to increase from 11. 3 million in 2007 to 15. 5 million in 2030 (WHO, 2008).

At first she was a little timid because it has been almost two years since she last went on a roller coaster, but we made it work and she overcame the sacredness and persevered to be able to enjoy her day. One ride in particular that she says was definitely her most memorable time because of the sheer terror it puts into you, the height it goes to, and the countless amount of loops was on Superman The Ride. I liked this one also as it suspends you in a flying position throughout the ride. We enjoyed awesome snacks throughout the day and really bonded over this experience. She got to hang out with her two best friends and it was good for them to bond because with social activities and school it seems as if they never get the time to hang out and socialize with each other anymore.

So I gave one of them to the cashier she later returned it, that it an insufficient balance. So in my mind if one is not going through the other should do. I gave her the second one also the same story not until I gave her the third one. And it turned out to be same story.

Our kids are getting older and it is a bit easier to travel.  They have always wanted to go on an airplane somewhere.  Didn't matter where, they just wanted to experience it.  So we looked into some options and decided we would fly from Massachusetts to Myrtle Beach.  We did not tell them that we were planning on doing it.  We wanted it to be a surprise.  About a week before we were going to go, we told them with a card and some things to bring.  The look on their faces was priceless.  They jumped around for about an hour and could not wait to tell everyone they knew.  We took this vacation that last week in June 2019.  We flew out of a local airport down to Myrtle.  The whole time, the kids had smiles from ear to ear.  We spent an entire week at a resort right on the beach.  My whole family loves the beach so it was the perfect setting.  The day we had to come back they were so upset but excited to go back on the plane.  When the trip was over, the first thing they asked was when we could do it again.  It made my wife and I feel so happy.  We will definitely look to do this again soon.  Maybe next time a longer flight as well.", "label": "recalled", "group": "B6O8M70Z"}

I was in Bali enjoying a vacation with my friends when I got a call from my son in law. My daughter had gone into labor very unexpectedly. She was only 28 weeks pregnant and something had caused her to go into pre-term labor. I don't remember how I did it but I managed to get to the airport and on a plane within a few hours. The flight was long and I had no cell phone service the entire way, I have never been so scared in my entire life. Once I landed and turned my cell phone on I had probably 30 text messages and missed calls, the baby had been born. She was healthy! I don't think I'd ever felt such relief in my entire life. I will always remember that day and how close I felt to possibly losing my little granddaughter.

I could stop so we were divorced by the time she turned seven and my husband ended up with custody of our daughter. We all co-existed as peacefully for the next 2 years, I was granted every other weekend visitation rights.

It was the police and they told me that my daughter there at the station and asked me to come in immediately.

They hadn't gotten very much from her but stated she had not been picked up from school so she walked home yesterday afternoon to discover she had been locked out. They told me that she somehow thought she was responsible and ashamed of this so decided to try and run away, and that she was spotted at the local mall by a security guard that thought it was strange she was there so long unattended. I her \"why didn't you just call me!?!\" She told me the medications her daddy made her take made her mind fuzzy and her time with me was the only thing that made it all better and she didn't want me to think she wasn't getting better because she didn't want to take the chance of having her visits with me become like living with her Daddy.

This was very exciting as it was my first major event that I did as a police officer. It may not sound like much to the average person, but for a police officer searching a building with the unknown potential of a person being inside is quite dangerous because you do not know if they are armed and/or under the influence of a substance. After securing the building there were no individuals found inside. We contacted dispatch again to let them know the result of the search and to contact a \"key holder\" to let them know about the unlocked door. We returned to our patrol car and waited for dispatch to contact the key holder for the church. This church was one of three churches within our community and we did proactive policing by check all the doors at each church. That is how we came across this unlocked door at the church. This is only one of many stories that I have as being a police officer. This job requires patience, paying attention to little details, learning and reacting from mistakes without hesitation, and to be respectful and brave. We look out for our community and the safety of each and every individual within. I love my job as a police officer and I cannot wait to see where it takes me in the future.

I have been a Blair Witch fan for 20 years, so this was a big deal to me. I decided that I would write an article about the series which would chronicle the mythology of the story and pitch the article to the major horror sites. To my surprise and delight, one of the first sites I pitched to, Wicked Horror, picked it up. It ran in four parts over the course of about a month. I was so excited! I had just gotten paid to write a four part article on a subject I loved and was passionate about! In addition, it was very well received. Garnering many views and many likes on the pages. I felt elated and proud and the rush that comes with creating something and having it be appreciated. The actual writing of the article had been exhausting (even more so because I was (and am) in the middle of a rather intensive diet which had a tendency to make me light headed at times) and required an immense amount of reading on my part. This was all made worthwhile by selling the piece and getting the positive reaction, however.

Unfortunately I greatly underestimated how much work would be involved. Before I did it I thought, \"Oh it's just weaving, how hard could it be?\" Pretty hard, it turns out. I went down to a local school here and managed to take lessons there, which lasted for a few weeks. During those lessons I was able to get some exposure to various types of weaving materials, which was nice. After a while I finally decided on attempting to create my own scarf. They're shaped very simply and don't involve too many types of fabric, so I figured that was a good starting point for projects. Overall the process wasn't too bad, but that yarn I used sure was a pain in the ass to work with. It was really thick and stiff, and kind of difficult to get into the right patterns for weaving. I kept at it and that perseverance and endurance carried me to the finish line, so to speak. Around the time that I finished the scarf there was a state fair taking place, so I decided to enter the scarf into a competition just for fun. There were some incredibly talented people in the contest, so my competition was pretty tough. In the end, though, I placed 4th and even got a cute ribbon!

After 6 years of marriage with my wife, we decided to separate. There are some things in life that cannot be reconciled, but when it comes to children, sacrifices must be made. A few months prior to our separation, my supervisor at the electronics factory advised me that I would have to begin working overseas in China due to the increased costs of production in our country, and if I refused, I would lose my job and status in the company indefinitely. I was devastated to hear this, my supervisor of  10 years put me in this tough situation of choosing whether i leave my family or leave my job. There were many things to consider, first off, after working under this supervisor for about a decade, I accumulated quite a lot of pay raises and perks to my job that made living easy for my family and I, and it wasn't easy to find the same things in another job. With my family, my daughter recently started middle-school and at this time in her life, it would be beneficial for her to make stable friends and develop relationships that last throughout her life. My wife didn't  like the idea of moving overseas because of her losing her job and our daughter's social health not being right. I did not know what to do in this situation whatsoever. I was angry with my supervisor for not offering me another position in the United States or referring me to another organization. I was also angry with my wife since she didn't want to come with me to China and start a new life over there. While i understood her concerns about not living there, I was still determined to pick up this new job position and continue working for the same company. Even though I made this tough decision and I knew this would come, my wife and I decided to separate because of this. In all honesty, separating was the hardest thing for me to overcome emotionally. We could not come to terms and agree on how things should be and for the sake of my daughter, we decided that my wife and her would stay in the USA while i travelled to China and lived there to do my work.", "label": "imagined", "group": "H8JUP9RZ"}

My father had been struggling with cancer, and my mother was obviously in despair about this.  It was a rough time for all of us, especially because money was tight with the cost of medication.  I tried to help as often as I could.  One night, some people broke into my parents home and stole money - WHILE my dad was on his deathbed.  I found out later that they were drug dealers coming to collect money that my parents owed them.  Dad had been using marijuana and other drugs to make himself more comfortable while he died slowly.  Its not something I would normally approved of, but I did understand in this circumstance. The hospital would offer no help unless he was admitted - in which case they could offer morphine for the pain.  But, the hospital stay was incredibly costly and the insurance only covered a portion of it, so it was actually cheaper to use the drug dealers....or so they thought.  I gave my mom some money to help get by until their next pension payments came in.   Mom needed to get dad some more morphine from the dealers, and this time, the upped the price.  When my mom refused to pay the additional money to them, they snatched her purse and stole all the cash she had brought with her, AND didn't even give her anything in return.  I felt horrible to watch my parents suffer through this, let alone to have to deal with it while dad was in such dire straits.  I felt useless and helpless - I still do.  I remember telling my mom that I couldn't give her anymore money to be robbed or wasted, but she refused to tell me where to obtain the drugs so I could deal with it, but she refused to tell me who they were out of fear.  I wondered how they knew where she lived!  I told her that after dad passes that she should move in with my husband and I.  Dad went shortly after, and mom moved in with me.

It seemed too good to be true and had me ecstatic. After a couple weeks of sending spuratic emails with the land/homeowner, I feel like I had a sort-of good idea of the condition of the house, although my main judgement was based on the pictures posted online. When the day came that I was to move it, I could not be happier. I had my Uhaul ready, and left for my new, possibly wonderful home. When I got there after a 3 hour drive, my expectations died. The house needed new aluminum siding, and the lawn looked sad and dead. My heart sank. I then realized that I got catfished. I pieced together in my mind that the pictures of the house i saw online were several years old. Once going inside, the house stunk. The carpets were dirty and the paint on the walls were all chipped up. The worse part was that there were so many dead bugs in the house. After inspecting the mess, I contacted the previous owner. I was irate and livid and told them all the issues present. They tried to argue, but in the end they agreed to come out and get some work done on it. After about 2 weeks of repairs and touchups, the home I purchased looked so much better.

For a while, and I mean a while, we had no idea what area we would be looking in. All we knew is that we didn't want to buy a home too far from our family so our son could grow up knowing them. We also wanted our parents to witness him grow in person and not over a video chat hundreds or thousands of miles away. The way it all happened was so crazy and unexpected, I didn't really see it coming. We were renting a very old, run down house that was poorly renovated to be a duplex. The walls were thin, there were leaks and holes on the outside allowing all sorts of wildlife into the attic and crawl spaces. The stairs were so narrow that getting furniture in and out had to be done out of the second floor. We had to get out of there and fast. One day I went to get my haircut and I started talking to the hairdresser that I had only seen once before. I was talking about our need to move and that we didn't want to move too far from where we were. Much to my shock she was actually considering short term renting and selling the home she lived in.

When I got home, Nyx was laying on his side almost lifeless and barely moving.  Out of concern, I felt his bladder and it was very hard.  Realizing that Nyx was actually blocked, I woke my dad and sister up and said that we need to go to MedVet immediately because he probably wasn't going to make it until our regular vet opened.  We rushed him to the closest animal hospital and the vet techs immediately took him to the back room.  I felt terrified that he was going to die.

If they couldn't place a urinary catheter, then the prognosis was not going to be good for Nyx.  While we could afford temporary care until we got Nyx to his regular vet when they opened, we could not afford to pay for a surgery at the animal hospital.  The whole situation felt hopeless to me.

I applied over 10 jobs and have 1 phone interview and another with an in-person interview in this 2 months period.  I went for the in-person interview job and find out I have experiences with the position.  I was excited to learn that I got one of the job with a much higher pay than what I am earning.  I also will have less stress on certain part of the job compared to what I am working as.  I will be starting the new job in about a week.  I hope things will be alright.  I feel anxious and excited at the same time.  It is partly because I was in the same position for close to 12 years in the same company and now I will have to adjust to a new routine.  Some of my coworkers where I am working in now are very sad about my leaving.", "label": "recalled", "group": "AJA42NUU"}

They were there simply to support me in my time of grief. The greatest support came from my boyfriend, though. We started dating about a month before my mother's passing. His loyalty and love has been instrumental in helping me get through this. Two of my closest girlfriends were also there.

It was an arduous journey to get there and I was short on funds so I decided not to walk. It also seemed silly to celebrate an organization that demonstrated time and time again that it didn't care about me or my peers. Let's be honest with ourselves, university functions are rarely about the students themselves and their accomplishments. That said, I somewhat regret not walking because a few of my peers did. We were a class of 9 and about half of us chose to attend the graduation ceremony. My peers were what made graduate school worthwhile. They helped me learn and supported me like no other. While, yes, I had a few professors who taught me a great deal about my particular concentration, the overall impression that I was left with by the faculty was that I was labelled as a lost cause (and too fat to be taken seriously... but that's a different story). For as much as my family insisted that this was an accomplishment, it didn't feel that way. It felt more like a significant waste of my time, energy, and capital. It has been hard to fully process all of my feelings about graduating. I wish I felt proud, but I was unpleasantly surprised to find that I  mostly felt lost, worthless, and full of resentment. That may have been the primary motivator for not wanting to participate outside of not being able to spare the expense. I hope I can one day reflect more positively on my graduation, but right now I'm struggling with this less than stellar emotional quagmire.", "label": "recalled", "group": "IVIFH17R"}

We had a fantastic visit with my employers. After a short meeting, they took us to a great Greek restaurant where I tried several new foods. From there, we went to our hotel which was located in the heart of the city. We visited an architecture museum and learned a lot about the origins of the city. We also went to see The Bean, which is a chrome bean that is absolutely enormous and sits in the middle of a park. We went to the Navy Pier and had some great food. The highlight (or perhaps the lowlight) of the trip was our lunch where we ate traditional Chicago deep dish pizza. The pizza was unreal- so thick and cheesy! Even though I was starving I could only eat a single slice. But just as we were eating, the city got hit with a tremendous thunderstorm. I have never encountered anything like it before. It was downright traumatizing though fortunately, it passed quickly. We wrapped up the short trip after another day of museum hopping and shopping.

I will miss Cheebs, as I called her, as I feel this may be the last dog that my wife and I get as we are getting up in years ourselves. Cheeba was having respiratory problems that have been getting worse and worse until some days she could hardly catch her breath. Her appetite was about gone except for special meals that I would fix her. Cheebs was a great dog- lots of intense love went both ways. We had had her since she was a very young puppy. She was very protective of our family, but not mean at all. So, today has been one of the worst days of my life. We agreed that she was suffering and no way to get better and we were just being selfish, so we decided today would be it. We called our Vet who had been expecting this call. He told us to come on and with a heavy leaden heart, we got her into the car. She liked car rides and didn't mind the vet as she'd known the same one all her life. We both got out of the car with tears in our eyes and let her pee on the grass and then took her inside. They were ready for us and  we put her on the table and got her calm and said our good-byes. It was almost like she looked at me with understanding and was okay about it. We stayed with her and the Vet injected her with the drug.

{"id": "3OB0CAO74IBNQ3XM9THJZBSRXNSYHW", "text": "This story is about struggles in my life and how it has affected me physically and emotionally.  I grew up in an abusive, alcoholic household. I was constantly tormented by my mother, father, maternal grandmother, and older brother throughout my childhood. I've had such a hard time as an adult trying to navigate responsibilities and relationships. I have made many, many mistakes and missteps that were completely unnecessary, just because I had no clue how to live a functional life. I have hurt myself and others because that's all I saw the adults in my life doing as I grew up in that abusive family. I think what was most surprising to me was when I needed to move back into my parents' home for a short stint when I was in my 30's. I had hoped so strongly that this would be the opportunity for us all to be loving and supportive of each other. Instead, the abuse was just as awful as I had ever endured; except now they extended the mistreatment to my daughter, as well. The situation came to a head one night when my inebriated mother picked a fight with my daughter and me. And. my father decided to join in by striking me. I called the police. He went to jail. And I had to find another place to live immediately. I was enrolled in college at the time, trying to improve myself so I could manage raising my child on my own in a home of our own. But now, I had to try finishing college while working non-skilled jobs that didn't pay enough for us to survive. So, for the next 6 years my daughter and I were homeless, couch surfing, seedy motels, and so forth. We never knew how long we would have at any given place. We didn't have enough money for food or utilities, or medicines. I began to fall ill from the strain of such impossible circumstances. It was horrific. I am a little more settled now. But, the effects from all that atrocity has left me with, seizures, migraines, IBSD, psoriasis, arthritis, acute anxiety, clinical, depression, PTSD, insomnia and hyper somnolence, most recently starting to have frightening seizures, and worst of all PTSD.

We were married quite young at 21 and 18, respectively. We both had our expectations going into this, but communication was always a problem from the start. I had the expectation of committing to a partner that would put their best foot forward and do whatever it takes to help us be successful. Unfortunately, she was just looking for someone to take care of her. This became evident pretty quickly when she refused to find work. We were living with her father at the time which was a very uncomfortable situation for the both of us. While I slaved away jumping from dead end job to dead end job, she continued to do nothing to help us. Even bringing up the idea of going job hunting was enough to ensue a shouting match, a crying fit, ecetera. Eventually I just stopped trying. Her sense of entitlement has only gotten work throughout the years, especially as I know have a job where I can (barely) afford to support us in our own home that we rent.

The past few weeks had been nothing but a blur; we'd had reading period and exams, and then I went home for two weeks to do basically nothing but visit family. Once I flew back to Boston, it was a few more days of hanging out with friends, making some final memories, and finally beginning that last day. At any rate, around 6 AM, I was down in the dining hall in my cap and gown having mimosas with my roommates (I'd later discover that giving a bunch of hungover college students mimosas and then keeping them away from a bathroom for half a day is a questionable idea). We didn't really talk much; I think we were just tired and overwhelmed. Eventually, we were all called to head outside and get ready to parade from the House to Harvard Yard. We were led by a small brass band that was only slightly better than the Harvard University Band, which isn't exactly a compliment. They directed us to Memorial Chapel, which they somehow packed in the entire class of 2019 into. Fire codes were definitely violated. At Memorial Chapel, the minister gave a short sermon and led the class in a few hymns. I'm not religious at all, but being in that church with that group of incredible people that were going to go on to do amazing things was a really powerful experience. I felt very connected to everyone. I also had to pee, but it was absolutely impossible to get out, haha. Afterwards, we went outside to Harvard Yard to begin the very long procession into Tercentenary Theater, where the commencement exercises are held. My roommates and I were near the front and got to wave and cheer the long line of alumni, faculty, and guests (including Angela Merkel!!!) as they entered. The actual exercises proceeded as they always have. After the sheriff of Middlesex county formally calls the meeting to order and the standard pleasantries are observed, the dean of each school presents his/her class to President Bacow, who would then essentially say \"Poof! You've graduated!\". Afterwards, I and the other Band seniors ran up to the Band as they played the recessional music and we each conducted our favorite fight song. As big and grand as the actual exercises were, they paled in comparison to the feeling of being with the Band, which was the one place at Harvard where I always felt absolutely welcome and included. Band absolutely defined the past four years of my life, and standing in front of them as I conducted Ten Thousand Men of Harvard -- I felt on top of the world. Afterwards, we had the actual degree ceremony back at our House, which my roommate and I were nearly late to. It was a really noticeable contrast from Band as I noticed that of the hundred or so other graduates in my House, I only knew my roommates and perhaps ten others. That night, the Band party provided both closure and countless tears. The next day, I was off to Greece with some friends for a vacation.", "label": "recalled", "group": "N0PE5INN"}

I have only had 1 or 2 panic attacks previously in my entire life, so this was very out of the ordinary. I was in my living room when this happened and my wife immediately started helping. She asked me to name 5 objects around, the room, then 5 colors. This helped me focus and get myself back under control. This was a triggering event to make me realize I needed to stop ignoring my mental health issues and seek help. So with the encouragement of my wife, I went to see my family Doctor. I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. My family doctor recommended medication, which was also a trigger for me, as I had a lot of misconceptions about taking medication for mental health. I felt like it would make me weak. Though I did eventually try the medication and it helped me immensely. All my physiological reactions went away. I also decided that day to seek out therapy.", "label": "recalled", "group": "FMF61ZN9"}

I had only gained 3-4 pounds, and was not showing whatsoever. My surgery was of course cancelled, and instead of going home to recover from knee surgery, I instead went home to spend the next 4 months learning how to be a mother.

From straightforward assignments like sitting up or lifting their head to more progressed developments like rolling over, these small accomplishments are continuously inspiring.

But, the most memorable thing was how everyone took the time to comfort one another and provide support like nothing I've every seen. The amount of compassion exhibited was extraordinary. I don't think I've every received so many hugs and condolences in my life.  It was quite an unusual thing to experience. I have thought about it many times over the last 5 months. I have even spoken to several of those who attended since that time. It is still hard to adjust to her being gone, but she will never be forgotten. I look at her pictures often and it still puts a smile on my face, yet makes me tear up at the same time.

It was a surprise diagnosis given to me after I had finally opened up about my trauma. Holding it in was hard, but getting this diagnosis was a lot harder for me. I'm decently young so I was confused as to how someone my age could get such a serious disorder. I didn't know you could have PTSD from things other than wars and such, so getting the diagnosis confused me a lot. I had to and am still in ongoing treatment for it, but at the beginning it was really tough. Going through the trauma with my therapist was exhausting and still is. Every day since then I've struggled with reality and how I view or trust the world and others. On that day I knew I had to take it slow and trust the process. Though things weren't looking too bright, I'm really glad I didn't give up. I wanted to give up more than anything but I wouldn't allow myself to. I knew there was more out there for me, so even though it hurt I pushed through. It taught me a lot though, as a positive. I've learned so many new helpful and healthy skills to deal with my emotions, as well as I've got an amazing support group.

I haven't been on vacation in years, and my dad decided all four of us should take a vacation, and spend a few nights at the Down Stream Casino on the Oklahoma Missouri border. Being with my closest family member's meant the world to me. We started out at my apartment in Tulsa, OK and we drove about an hour and 15 minutes to our destination. When we first arrived I bought some Ice Cream at the casino's Ice Cream stand for my Son and I. After that we got the keys to our room, and brought all of our luggage there. We shared two rooms, and the rooms were extremely nice, and comfortable to relax and sleep in. I stayed in one room with my son, and my parents stayed in another. I didn't participate in much gambling, instead we watched Ellen DeGeneres Game show, and stayed up late watching TV and having good conversation with my son, and parents. After that we drove to a local restaurant, and had dinner together. Then my dad took me on a tour of the casino, bar, and slot machines. He showed me the machines he likes playing, I played with 20 dollars, and ended up cashing out 40, so I made a nice little profit.  I will always cherish this vacation with my close family member's that I don't always get to see. Their kindness and love will always radiate with me, and I will always remember them choosing to spend time with me, and make my day that much better.

We found our room, dropped off some stuff and then went to get some food.  They were serving burgers and fries at one of the eateries.  We waited in line, there were a lot of people.  The food was not great but we figured it was due to the number of people being served and they were rushing to serve as many as possible.  The food throughout the cruise was hit and miss...but mostly very good.  At least, if we did not like something, we could go back and get something else.  The cruise was a once in a lifetime experience.  We got to see so much beautiful scenery and we had 4 stops on land.  Glacier Bay was spectacular, a sight I will never forget.

When everyone was gathered and silently waiting, Sheila yelled, \"Okay, cake, come on out!\" Out walked the most beautiful Princess Belle that I had ever seen. She was gorgeous, and wearing the most stunning yellow dress, just like in the movie. Sheila walked up to her with a knife and stabbed the dress while everyone gasped in horror. Sheila and Belle looked at each other and laughed, the dress was the cake! I had never seen anything like it, not even on the cake making shows on television. It was mind blowing. Belle stood still while Sheila cut everyone a piece of the dress cake. I doubted that it would taste very good, thinking that there must be a trade off for the amazing appearance of the cake.

I babysit him every now and then, but my favorite moment with him (he was about 1 and a half years old at the time) was when I babysat him during this big thunderstorm. We'd had a huge round of storms hit our little town earlier in the month, with crazy amounts of damage, so it was a bit scary for everyone when we had this mild storm front move through. My friend and her fiance were both working, so it was just me and the baby alone in my friend's apartment when it hit. Thunder was shaking the building, rain was coming down in sheets, and there was even a moment we had some hail and a branch flew into the window. As you would probably expect, I was frightened and a little insecure. However, the baby was curious (as most kids his age are) and wanted to see what was going on outside. He kept trying to pull on the back door handle (baby-proofed, thankfully), and throwing toys at the window. It was just innocent curiosity and wonder for something that looked objectively awesome to someone so young. So, in perhaps a mildly reckless manner (although I did keep a good hold of him), I picked up the little man and opened the door to the back patio for him to see. Then, he sprouted his first word that I'd ever heard from him, \"Wow!\" In that moment, with one hand stretching out into the rain, and the other clutching tightly to my necklace, I didn't feel scared anymore. I felt warm, and happy for the gift this world had given me that I got to hold in my arms. Reflecting back, I guess that was the first time I could genuinely see his future stretching out in front of him; and, more importantly, my place in that future. I hope, that by the time he's old enough not to remember that storm, I can still encourage him to follow that curiosity and see all the wonder the world has to offer.", "label": "recalled", "group": "6ZCVT28Y"}

My brother, in asking for clarification, spoke in a tone that seemed to offend the waiter.

After this exchange, my brother became quiet. I think he had no idea that the waiter had been offended.  I, who am used to my brother's questioning ways, was very surprised to see the waiter act so offended.

That afternoon, I went to go pick up my kid from school.  I ended up driving behind that same friend, who had kids in the same school.  There was a school bus stopped along the rode, which was a rural highway.  I saw it and slowed down, but my friend in front of my didn't see it.  She ran right over children who were getting off the bus.  The kids were killed in that horrible accident.  My friend couldn't even offer condolences; she was just saying how busy she was and that she didn't see.  She was too busy to see the bus stopped, too busy to see the precious lives in front of her...too busy...too busy.  I picked up my kid and went home, too moved to eat dinner that night.  I could have been that woman: too busy to see; too busy with what?  Too busy with chores that never end to spend precious time with loved ones?  Too busy to spend time praying, or doing worthwhile hobbies that I enjoy?  Am I too busy to pass those hobbies, those precious moments and memories on to my kids?  I realized that I had been going through life numb, as if on auto-pilot, just checking off tasks on a list.  All the while, the things that truly matter were passing me by.  I hugged my spouse and child close, and determined that I would no longer miss what's important in life.  Each day is precious:  I will remember and truly learn to live.", "label": "imagined", "group": "RFBRQXM4"}

The waterfall near the entrance to the cave itself, as we walked down the stairs, tinkled musically.  A rich earthy smell, pleasant and verdant, filled the air around us.  We went through the entrance area and entered into the cave opening itself. The ceiling is low here and some people had to duck.  We followed the guide along a paved path that was very easy to walk along, past some interpretive signs about the animals that live near the cave's entrance.  There was a notation that no animals live within the cave itself.  The guide slowly walked us into a larger chamber of the cave and using a flashlight, directed everyone to a metal railing.  We were asked to firmly grab the rail and once he confirmed that everyone was holding the rail, he turned his light off, plunging us into complete darkness. Then the guide said, \"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Mammoth Cave,\" and flipped on the brighter tour lights.  Suddenly, before our eyes we realized we were standing in an immense cavern that stretched out beyond where the light touched.  Many people gasped in delight and awe as they took in the scope and size of this wondrous place. My daughter turned to me with sparkling eyes and breathed, \"It's so beautiful! I had no idea a cave could be this big!\"  I too, was stunned at the size, having been in many caves and thinking of them as low, tight places.  Our whole group listened to the guide as he told of the cave's discovery, how people mined for saltpeter here during the American Civil War, how a doctor thought the cave air could cure tuberculosis patients and brought them here in the hopes they would recover.  We saw the places where a preacher gave sermons and where visitors marked their names on the roof of the cave with candle soot. Visiting the Mammoth Cave was an experience that taught me so much.  I have told many people that visiting this cave is something they shouldn't miss the opportunity to do.", "label": "recalled", "group": "DE1HG3UM"}

After my wife and I took off work for a couple weeks during the month of July (before the boy's birthdays), we both thought it would be a great idea to make this whole trip a complete surprise. We planned to travel to a beach for Todd's sake and that it be far away enough from home so that we'd be able to board an airplane for Jeff's sake. So, after endlessly searching for the best prices and deals for airline tickets and hotel rooms, we finally landed (no pun intended) on really cheap tickets that were about $350 each round trip with a hotel room included in the package deal. My wife and I were very excited to reveal the plans to our kids when their birthday came around, but at that point in time, we were just hoping that neither of us \"spilled the beans\". Two weeks later, it finally was time to reveal the big secret. As soon as Jeff and Todd woke up in the morning, we happily wished them both a happy birthday. After seeing the loving smiles on their faces my wife and I knew it was time to make their day even better. This was the most memorable moment that I could remember, when we told the boys about the trip we had planned they both leaped out of bed and hugged each other and yelled out of excitement. Neither of the boys had been on an airplane before so this was going to be a brand new experience for them. Seeing them so overwhelmed with joy brought so much love to my heart that day. I also remember the way that the kids packed up their suitcases the day before we left for vacation, it was surely a sight to see. They were so full of energy that they piled all of their clothes and toys mindlessly in one large heap in the middle of the suitcase, they wanted to leave as soon as possible no matter how disorganized they were!

I'm 46 years old and I rememeber the 1986 Davis reunion as it was held at the Brewster Gun Club in Brewster, Ohio.  If I were to guess, I would say that there were at least 50 people there, possibly more.  I can't say for sure, because no photo was taken.  The other Davis family reunion was in 1973 and was held at the American Legion in Beach City, Ohio, which is about five miles south of Brewster.  I was only five months old and obviously don't remember it.  But, a group photo was taken and my cousin Shawna has me in her lap.  Well, fast forward to February 2019.  I got to thinking about the Davis family tree and thought it was about time someone put together a long-overdue reunion.  Thanks to Facebook, I was able to reach out to several relatives, and even discovered a few more that were out of state.  It would have been cool to have it at the aforementioned Brewster Gun Club, but it no longer exists.  It has been replaced by an apartment complex.  BUT, the Beach City American Legion was still in existence so I got ahold of the commander and he was more than happy to have us rent out the place.  The cost was only $150 which I thought was appropriate.  My wife and I probably spent a good 80-90 percent of the overall cost of the reunion.  A good chunk of that was renting a U-Haul truck because of all the tables, chairs and barbecue grill.  That, and the reunion was 85 miles from our house!  Needless to say, it was a lot of work getting the reunion set up and of course, taking it down and cleaning up.  We left our house at 6am and didn't get home till midnight. The reunion itself had about 35 people attend, some of which I hadn't seen since the last reunion in 1986!  There were a few that weren't in attendance that I would have loved to have seen.  Just seeing old relatives reconnecting after so many years almost brought a tear to my eye.  My one cousin wants to do a reunion every year, but I am thinking maybe every two years.

He had been ordered to do things over and over as our marriage went on and decided not to abide by any of the agreements we made that were turned into court orders, but no one ever did anything about those things. I finally was able to take him to court and get justice for myself and my children. We went to court last month on a Rule to Show Cause for why he had not done the things that were in the agreement. He got a lawyer, but I could not afford one, as it took me 10 months to save up the money for filing for the hearing in the first place. When we started testifying, his lawyer kept breaking in to say that the things that I was trying to tell her were irrelevant, but I needed to get the information out there to prove why they were relevant. He also lied to the court regarding what I was testifying about and had lied in many cases in the past and always won based on those lies. In one case, he lied in a child support case to the extent to where the judge wouldn't listen to anything I said and even went so far as to deny me child support in the case, leaving the kids and I with nothing at all from him but what we were able to talk him out of at holidays, which typically was not much. But for some reason, this judge was different. She actually listened to me and let me present my evidence and connect the dots in the case. I didn't have an attorney, so I wasn't really sure what I was doing and I was scared that he would be laughing at me on the way out the door again, as he always did when they won. But she was patient with me and gave me a chance to locate the information that she needed in order to decide what she was going to do about is. There was one part of the case that he should have been responsible for paying for that she dismissed, because of an error at the courthouse that caused his attorney to not have all of the documentation that she needed, but the judge said that she would allow me to bring that case back with the proper paperwork, so that they could fix the error and she would decide on that separately. When it was over, she ordered him to comply with the order and pay me everything that he owed me within 45 days or go to jail. This was extremely emotional for me because myself and my children are having a hard time living with no income and we were at risk of having some of our utilities turned off. Now we are doing a little better and have been getting some payments from him, which is nice, considering that we were getting nothing at all prior to the court case. Before we left, my heart sank a little because his attorney threatened to appeal the case which would mean that I would have to wait even longer to get anything done or get some help with the kids, he was not able to and had to start paying me.", "label": "recalled", "group": "NUU56XP8"}

There was a comment on the paper that came with my ribbon, strengths and weaknesses of my project. They were not enthuisatic about my ends, but I am fine with the way I choose. It is extremely different and was difficult to learn, which increased my self esteem and was more encouraging. I often look at my scarf and know I have a lot of potential and talent in me for weaving. I'ts interesting to think about why it took decades for me to intersect with a way to learn how to weave, when I had been wanting to for decades. Of course the internet did not exist in the 1970's. I am not a big fan of all this high tech in life. But I will say the internet is a blessing for every person on this planet that has access. No matter where you are, you can type something you want to learn about, and up it pops. People from all over the globe have uploaded their skills and instructions for doing everything!

Even though I have spent over 30 years of studying 6 hours per week to teach adults the one hour class, I still am taught new things by the Holy Spirit as I study.  I encountered something that I found to be particularly touching today as I studied Acts 1:1-11.  The passage states that the book of Acts is about all that Jesus began to do and teach.  By verse 11, Jesus has already ascended into heaven, but this is still the beginning of what Jesus began to do and teach.  Subsequently, he will use the apostles and others who are called to preach to continue his teachings to the world. The apostles have spent the 40 days since Christ's resurrection learning how all of the Old Testament was about Jesus.  They were being instructed in the knowledge they would need continue to teach others.  Yet, they had been cowardly, scattering away from Jesus when he was crucified (except John who stayed).  So in addition to knowledge, they needed power to behave differently and that would soon come with the new ministry of the Holy Spirit introduced at Pentecost, 10 days after Jesus' ascension. But, in addition to knowledge, believers were advised to conduct themselves in a manner that could not be criticized (1 Peter 3:15-17).  Their behavior should adorn them.  That is what touched me.  The word adorn is so beautiful.  Most days I simply dress myself.  Yet, when I was dating, I would adorn myself with some cologne and my best shirt to be as attractive as I could be.  It touches me that the scripture urges be to adorn myself with righteous behavior.  It also convicts me.  I have studied and have a lot of knowledge of God through the Bible.

It wasn't actually my birthday yet, but I love hiking and my brother lives in another part of the state and couldn't go on my actual birthday so we decided to go on our annual hiking trip and chose Lassen for our destination. A friend of a friend had recently visited and showed pictures of the snow-covered mountain, and we both thought it would be fun to go to somewhere with snow in the middle of summer. I took a bus to Oakland and then we drove from there to Lassen, arriving at the park and snagging a camping spot at 3 AM but sleeping in the car. We woke up around 6 AM with the sun filtering between the pines, and set up our tents and  made breakfast. We went to the ranger station to ask for advice and recommendations. We then went around the Manzanita Lake, and saw gorgeous views of snow-covered Lassen Peak reflected across the placid lake with ducks and ducklings bobbing in and out of the water. We rented a kayak and paddled around the lake, admiring the views and relaxing under the sun and cool, light breeze. We were still pretty tired from the long trip, so we just relaxed in our campsite for the rest of the day, cooking and reading and chatting. The next day we headed up to Butte Lake to hike the Cinder Cone Volcano. It looked like a short and easy hike until we started going up the volcano since the steep trail consisted of loose cinders that made you slip back some inches with every step forward. It was the first time I'd ever gone up to a volcano's crater, and the views were fantastic. Going down was more of psychological challenge since I felt like I would slide down to my death and went down very slowly. We relaxed by the Butte Lake and dipped our dirty, dusty feet on the freezing water until heading over to Redding to buy some microspikes since we wanted to climb up Lassen Peak. Redding was hot and uneventful, but we got our microspikes. We had to wake up early the next day to climb the Lassen Peak, and although we were expecting snow, we didn't realize how much snow there actually still was. As SoCal residents we usually just see snow in the distant San Gabriel mountains, and driving up close to 15 feet high snowbanks was a surreal and awesome experience. We'd never hiked in snow and were really excited to try out the microspikes, but I was also hesitant since I'm prone to altitude sickness and was hoping it wouldn't ruin our trip. Luckily I didn't and we powered our way up the snowy trail, removing the spikes once the snow had melted away near the top. The views, as ever, were gorgeous and we looked down on a snow-dappled landscape and an icy lake. We reached the summit and took many photos, watching some people ski down the side of the mountain. It was an awesome trip and one of my most memorable ones.", "label": "recalled", "group": "BUXKYPK1"}

The experience was a bit surreal after having not played with this band for a few years, to suddenly be rehearsing and working as a group again. I had actually sold the bass that I used for the the band.  I had to locate and purchase a similar type of bass, which was an undertaking as they are somewhat rare and expensive.  I finally found one somewhere in Minnesota and had it shipped to Brooklyn. It had been neglected and needed a lot of work to put it back in playable shape.  Then I had to figure out how to travel with it since it is an electric upright bass. I eventually settled on the plan of disassembling it and putting the main body in a flight case, then taking the neck on the plane with me.  This was  an attempt to avoid paying a fortune for a full size case and then paying oversize and overweight charges that would have eaten into the budget for the trip. Anyway the plan worked out more or less. I hadn't anticipated that the TSA would look inside the case and pry little parts off of the bass to see if there was a bomb inside. So even though the case kept the bass from being knocked around, it didn't keep it safe from the TSA people. Anyway we arrived safely and i was able to put the bass back together. The show itself was in a 5000 seat hall, which was another surprise since our band probably draws about 1000 people, so that was kind of amusing. We recorded the next day with the band that split the bill with us and hopefully that recording should be released soon.

He had been to visit a couple of years ago, I have not been in probably 15 years.  Circumstances just did not allow me to go sooner.  We flew to Arizona to first go and visit his mother.  She had been having memory problems for a few years and had lived at home until recently.  This last year she could not even receive a phone call as she could not remember to speak into the phone.  We arrived and went to see her in a nursing home, assisted living.  She was so happy to see her son, but she did not know his name.  She looked at me a couple of times like she thought she should know me but she didn't.  I thought that was okay as I knew her.  She was always the sweetest lady I knew and it was so sad to see her lose her memories that way.  She had taught school her whole life, but all the information she knew was leaving quickly.  Even beyond that situation was the fact that no one had been to check on her.  I went in her room to see what she needed and found almost nothing.  We resupplied her before we left.  I also had brought her a lovely bed doll ( doll sits on your bed and looks cute).  It brought some color to her room.  I hoped when we left this doll might help her to just be happy.  This trip was one of the saddest I had been on.  A beautiful lifetime of memories just gone.", "label": "recalled", "group": "GIJC5IY0"}

Especially when you've been a sports fan your whole life, and a baseball fan, it means something. I have been going to baseball games for a long time. I used to bring my glove in hopes I would catch a foul ball, but once I got to a certain age, adulthood, I gave up. But still wanted to catch one, just to say I did. I went to a game with friends, it was pretty empty in the stands, but it was a nice day for a ballgame. Somewhere in the sixth or seventh inning, after I had gotten a beer, a player lofted a high foul ball that made me jump up because it was close to me. I ran over a few steps with the beer still in my hand but the ball was going to come up short. But then it bounced off the concrete, off a railing, and right into my chest. It dropped to the ground and I quickly grabbed it. Unfortunately I did not mention as it hit me, it caused my beer to spill all over my shirt, practically soaking it. But I had the foul ball. But once I had it in my hand, I realized it wasn't that important. So I found a kid with a glove and handed it to him, and he was so happy. I spent the rest of the game talking with him and his family. I felt like I made a new friend. So the price of a beer, a smelled soaked shirt, I learned a life lesson.

We both attend the same convention every year, so we started planning stuff to do while hanging out. This would not be one on one dates or hangouts but just places in general that we could go with other people we met at the convention. Well the convention was last month and in Texas which is her home state. I got there the Saturday before the con while she got there 3 days later. I had realized around January that I had liked her a lot but didn't want to tell her because I have a fear of rejection and asking her would just make things awkward. So when we went to eat ramen and play mini-golf  with a group of our friends not much happen. At ramen I wasn't able to sit next to her, but at mini-golf we were joking around with each other. Later we all went to the bars and as the night progressed we were holding hands and hugging. Even still I didn't really act on the anything because we were drunk and she could've just been being friendly. Basically the next day we did the same things: ate with a group of people, played games, and went out to the bars. This time however we kissed, so I thought that meant we were in the clear to confess our feelings for each other. The next day I woke up to a \"why did we kiss\" text. I was kind of nervous to answer cause i felt it was a mistake but i told her that I liked her. I was sure she was going to reject me and things would be awkward but instead she said she liked me too and that I should've asked her out earlier. So basically later that day I asked her out officially and we have been dating ever since. I was quite shocked and still am because I have never had a girlfriend before her.

He brought up an old friend of his who had sexually harassed me multiple times throughout my childhood and part of my early adulthood. This friend never did anything that was illegal enough for him to go to jail, but he constantly made me uncomfortable. It was always in secret when no one else was around, so my father never really knew about it. Eventually, once I was an adult, I had the courage to complain about the friend. My father didn't really believe me and thought I was exaggerating. Then, the friend finally did it in front of him. After that, they had a falling out for several years. Since I moved away from my home state, they seem to have reconciled. My father knows how uncomfortable this makes me, but he continues to be friends with the man. After hearing about him one too many times, I finally told my father to never mention him again, and he hasn't until our recent argument. During the argument, I told him that if he really feels like being friends with the man is so important even though he knows it hurts me, we wouldn't be able to speak with each other anymore. He told me I was overreacting and that because it happened so long ago, that it shouldn't matter. He claimed that my reaction was because of my mental health and that I had \"gone off the deep end\". This was particularly offensive because I deal with anxiety and depression and I had, over the past several months, come to confide in my father regarding these issues. I couldn't believe the way he was behaving. He refused to admit that he was wrong to treat me this way and would not even try to see things from my point of view.

My wife, being a little older, wanted to knock kids out of the way as soon as possible since the older you get the more chances of complications. That being said, it was off to the races whether I was ready or not. It took a while to get pregnant with nobody but to blame but the both of us, but me being me, i blamed her of course. I was terrified of having a child, although I knew we both were. I went to every checkup and doctors appointment with her.

He was 16 at the start of 2019, he would have been 17 in July 2019. I noticed around February 2019 that he wasn't eating his normal dog food, so I began looking for alternatives so he would be able to eat. I purchased various dog foods, from wet and dry and anything else I could find. Tried different meats like fish, chicken, beef and lamb. He would eat the new dog food that I purchased him for a few days and then all of a sudden stop eating it. It got to the point where I started making his own dog food in a desperate attempt to maintain his weight. But, as much as I tried, he just wouldn't eat as much as he needed to, or wouldn't eat at all. His eyesight was getting worse, to the point where he was almost completely blind. He went deaf when he was 14 years old, so it was breaking my heart watching him lose all of his senses. It was to the point where I was considering putting him down because his quality of life just wasn't there, but then he would have a good day and it would make me question myself.

I really wanted to have a natural birth - it was written down on my birth plan and everything. When contractions started at home, they were very sporadic. Over the next 72 hours, I labored slowly at home, practicing every pain management technique I had researched (the bathtub worked best for me). Towards the third day, the pain was intense and the doctor recommended I check into the hospital. As I settled in, the nurses recommended I get an epidural to help manage the pain. As I waited on the epidural, they suddenly ordered an ultrasound. It scared me a little. Was something wrong? Everything looked fine on the screen, to me. When the doctor came in, he gave me the news. My baby had turned from head down to transverse and there wasn't time to try to turn him. The baby monitor showed signs of distress. I had no choice but to have an emergency c-section. They put me to sleep and when I woke up, my husband told me our son was beautiful. I couldn't wait to hold him! It was all worth it when my sweet baby boy was placed in my arms and I was finally able to gaze into his chubby little face. I love him so much!", "label": "imagined", "group": "9K46W78F"}

I remember when I grew up, my family always had dogs and puppy around because we had such huge farm at the time. The most dogs we had at the time were 5 and they were all extremely attached me because I really enjoyed taking care of them and vice versa. It was even hard taking care of them with my family\u2019s help back then.  At this stage of my life, I want to take a big step of adopting my very first puppy, all on my own. I feel I am ready for this huge responsibility to take care of another life. I started looking for a breeder because I specifically want a Chocolate Labrador Retriever. I found a reputable breeder and she said she would put me on the waiting list and let me know when her dog got pregnant. Fast forward until 5 months ago, best news ever, the breeder called me that her dog delivered 5 beautiful and healthy babies and one of them could be mine. I was filled with joyed and immediately asked if I could visit them. The mama dog and the puppies were beautiful and of courses I picked out a male Choc Lab . I followed up every week and 3 months later, he was ready to go home with me. When I arrived and saw him, I busted out with tears and couldn\u2019t believe that he was mine. He is beautiful and no words can describe how happy I was and I still am. Every time I see my puppy, I recall the first moment I met him when he was tiny little pup and now, he grows so fast. He is so playful, eats a lot but not food aggressive because dog come from big litter can become food aggressive due to the nature of surviving instinct. He fills my day with happiness, he cheers me up after a long day at work. Cleaning after him is very exhausting but looking at those puppy eyes, I can\u2019t complain. He loves bath, I can\u2019t believe it. Most dogs hate it, and my dog enjoys it, it makes my life so much easier to bath him during these summer months because he is so actively. I have to say I\u2019ve made one of the best decisions of my life by adopting my first puppy, and I think I\u2019ll need to adopt another so that they\u2019ll can become best friends and do not feel lonely.", "label": "recalled", "group": "19O2ATOB"}

I then was placed on disability social security and suddenly found myself retired. Luckily, I just lost some use of my legs and went blind in my left eye, but better than those that suffered far worse then I.     Within this time, I became reacquainted with my very first kiss 48 years earlier. Her name was Debbie. While talking with her on New Year's Day 2019, she mentioned she was lonely, as was I. She said she was very single and living with her son in Daytona Beach Florida and invited me down (I lived in a suburb of Cleveland Ohio at the time.)      I planned to visit her, as I was nearing the end of my operations, and pretty sick of Northern winter weather. So, I visited this woman I had not seen in 48 years in April of this year. I was shocked that she wanted to see me the entire time I was there, but dismayed I didn't get our second kiss. I found and find her very attractive still.     When I got back up north, I still played in my mind the idea of moving down to Daytona Beach. My life as I knew it, was over in Ohio. No job, no children, friends were far gone. Thus, I took a big chance and decided to move down.     I found a home in June of 2019, that sounded great! It was furnished and the cost was affordable, thus I decided on it, and began to throw away all my furniture and everthing else from my long past.     When I finally moved down in late July of 2019, I got here and found that I was a victim of an internet scam by the woman selling me a place to live. There was no house. I had to live in a Motel 6 and an Airbnb until I could borrow money from my sister to find a home. The move itself now cost me $2000 and I have no furniture, forks, knives, dishes, pots, pans.....well I had nothing to put into it.     And it took me until the 3rd week of August to move in, and then I find out that a Hurricane is currently headed straight for Daytona Beach right now.

Lots of different emotions were had; joy, sadness, amusement, fun, anger, calm, and anything in between. There were significant stressors, although that doesn't mean it was all bad. Some of the topics were quite good and healthy, and I'll argue that even the touchy subjects made some headway. Overall, I really don't regret the experience.

She was starting her first job post graduation as an elementary school teacher. This was striking to me as a mom because I thought she would be excited to be starting a new life.  We had such a good time setting up her new house, buying furniture and unpacking.  It all seemed to be going well until she broke down in tears.  I was distraught as she sobbed that she didn't want to be there, that it was too far away from home. I tried (in vain) to be encouraging. I told her to think of it as a new adventure.  I held her as she wept, soothing that it was time for her to be on her own and that I knew she would be successful. I believed she had a heart for kids and that this was her vocation.  She SAID this was what she always wanted, but the reality of it was just too overwhelming.  To be honest, as much as I love my daughter, I don't get it.  I would have killed for such a great opportunity at her age.  She was being given what she said she wanted, and there she was a total wreck! I think about this event often and it's something that I mull over on an almost daily basis. I continue to be surprised, shocked and a little pissed when I consider the situation.  I hate the term \"adulting\"; it's not a verb I used.  But my daughter was not coping well at almost twenty-five. I have to wonder how this happened. I have always been attentive, but stressed that I expected her to stand on her own two feel and to be a strong, independent young woman.  I have done my level best to be the best I could as a mother to all my children. Most of them are hanging in there, but I wonder how to help my eldest who is chronically dissatisfied.

My ex and I started out fantastically as friends and unfortunately that is where it should have stayed. We began well enough, having stayed up night after night chatting with one another and gaming with one another. We were young, love struck and despite some flawed starts of jealousy from both sides, we did well at first. Then after the relationship became official it became a nightmare to even survive within. This was after my previous relationship where I royally messed up in the emotional support department and let somebody nice down, so I was more than prepared to endure here as a, I guess, makeup for the last. However, that kindness was taken advantage of and I was manipulated, lost friends and stopped talking to people I once contacted daily. Likewise my personal hobbies deteriorated and I was more or less told to spend every waking moment with them. I cannot personally state all the things that went on, or the ways I was kept in the relationship because I feel like those are too personal, but needless to say I basically hated it. I had to wait for her to get bored of me, find another person to obsess over and let her dump me for things to be peaceful. So I exited that as a mess, both relationship wise and mentally. Hated them in general for the longest time and wondered if I did things wrong. Kind of hard to believe the person I met turned out to be like that, so I blamed myself for it at times. However, over time I learned that it wasn't my fault, I let it go and moved on. There's no easy way to do it, but you just have to take the blow, accept the time lost and stop letting more time slip away due to it. Thankfully I met somebody who would help me with that and she has been amazing. I really wish I could say all the ways she is, but I only have three thousand characters here! So I will say this. She's stubborn, dependable, cocky at times and had humor that matches mine. She's flawed, yet perfect if that makes sense. I didn't make her out to be unrealistic in my mind and she never required it either, so I'm happy to be with her.

This is not our first child but this pregnancy and deliver were definitely some of the most challenging and difficult. My wife had been in and out of the hospital for monitoring over the prior two weeks due to hyper tension and worries of preeclampsia. This last time she was admitted they decided that they needed to keep her for monitoring. While she was having normal contractions it was noted that our babies hear rate would dip dangerously low with each contraction. This, they suspected, was because the umbilical cord was wrapped around the babies neck. The contractions were tightening the cord and cutting off some of her air supply. They decided they needed to induce right away. My wife was trying to push the baby out but was having great difficulty and everything was made even more difficult because of the babies heart rate dropping with every attempt. The doctor was getting frustrated and worried that she would not be able to deliver normally and had them prep the OR for an emergency C-section. My wife was adamant that she didn't want a C-section, but the doctor told her they would have to do what is in her and the babies best interests. He then said she had a few more minutes to try herself, and that she really needed to focus. At this point, my wife really tried and after a couple pushes, and some pulling from the doctor with a suction cup, the babies head was visible. The doctor quickly unwrapped the umbilical cord from around the babies neck and my wife finished the delivery of our little girl. The entire labor and delivery process took 45 minutes from start to finish. This was one of the most exciting, scary, happy, and stressful situations in my entire life.

It was quite embarrassing and afterwards I felt like I should've known better. My baby sister was about seven months pregnant and had changed the name of her gestating child from the one she'd originally chosen. She and her boyfriend had at first settled on Liam Michael. Liam was a name she'd been set on since teenage years and Michael is our brothers middle name. Suddenly they'd changed the name to Tucker Finn. Those who heard the name including myself, my boyfriend and my brother all privately laughed. Everyone thought it wasn't a great name because it rhymes with many unpleasant words, such as sucker and another word starting with \"F\". All we could think is of how that poor child would get teased mercilessly by his peers. Al three of us became increasingly uncomfortable about how everyone in the family privately snickered but nobody, includng us had spoken up. It felt rude for everyone to be almost sharing a private joke at my sister's expense. We began to surmise that maybe it was her boyfriend who'd initiated the name change or that maybe they just had not thought further about the name. So of course, I was elected to gently inquire,being the closes to my sister.  I thought was the right thing to do and both my brother and boyfriend urged me to. I finally asked her gently as possible why they changed the name. I said \"Tucker is okay but Liam was great and you'd wanted it for so long\". Well, she explained that they'd decided Liam was overused. She stated that she found my inquiry rude. I apologized profusely and said I'd meant no harm, I just wanted to be sure it was what she wanted. She accepted but was obviously not cheerful. Later, feeling ashamed, I googled etiquiette on baby names and realized I should've kept my thoughts to myself. The next day I apologized again and she accepted again, but was quite annoyed because after our conversation her boyfriend told her he didnt like the name Tucker Finn. Suprisingly my boyfriend, brother and I had been right that one of the pair didn't like the name but it was not the one we'd expected.

There\u2019s been an emergency.\u201d All I could think was that my dad had probably been taken by ambulance to the nearest hospital or something. So I asked the woman, \u201cAre they taking him to the hospital by ambulance? What hospital are they taking him to?\u201d Then the woman replied, \u201cNo, he\u2019s not going to the hospital. Your father has passed. Just try to get here as soon as you can.\u201dAll of the sudden I just felt overcome with panic. My hands were shaking as I quickly removed my daughter\u2019s car seat from the shopping basket and hurried toward the car. I was amazed at the superhuman strength I had in that moment. You don\u2019t really know what an adrenaline rush feels like until you\u2019ve either been in a life or death situation, or at least experienced what your mind considers to be the emotional equivalent. I swiftly swung my daughter\u2019s car seat in to the back seat of my SUV in a single motion. I drove with little regard for speed limit or traffic lights right to the bank down the street where my husband was working at the time.  When I finally reached the bank I swung open the double glass doors as quickly as I could. I spotted my husband sitting quietly at his desk. There were some customers waiting in the lobby, but honestly I couldn\u2019t have cared less. As soon as my husband noticed me I spoke the only words that I could think of at the time . \u201cMark! My dad\u2026 My dad died.\u201d Losing a parent is incredibly painful. Part of your identity dies. Nobody else remembers your childhood with the same sentiment. Nobody else really loves you as much as they did. It\u2019s a really difficult thing to come to terms with. It seems inconceivable that someone who\u2019s been there for us since day one can suddenly be \u2014 gone.", "label": "recalled", "group": "CG6FZWMS"}

She loves the Florida beach look, so we did a lot of shopping in nice gift shops and such. She bought a lot of decor and gifts for people, stuff that really represents the beach look and sand and surf. They have ocean in Alaska, obviously, but definitely not the white sand and warm beach waters that we have here!  She also bought a lot of beach-type clothing, but since not is really appropriate for cold and snowy weather, she bought a lot of sweatshirts that said \"Florida\" on them. We spent a lot of time at the beach, which is my favorite thing to do. We showed them how to surf cast and fish for whiting and pompano and bluefish and sheepshead. We also took out our boat several times, and my sister in law caught a small black-tip shark! They really had a fun time, as did we. My brother in law even got me jogging again, since he is a competitive mountain runner and had to keep running while with us. He said the soft sand gave him a great workout!

It all happened over the course of a few months where we would spend time playing video games with several of our mutual friends as we would play similar games to each other it was bound for us to spend time closely. Each time we would end up together one-on-one enjoying ourselves in popular games such as \"League of Legends\". Back in those days it was easy to mention life, mention our goals, aspirations and converse about what went on in the video game. There were times where we would spend the entire day just hanging around each other without the friends included. In due time we shifted away from spending time around mutual friends towards just being around each other constantly each and every day after work, school to hanging around in our calls playing, watching or doing normal stuff. It never entirely occurred to me that I would be interested in such a relationship where we were away from each other in person. An online relationship never necessarily worked in my mind but for this it felt this was the right stage of my life where I was open to the idea as long as it's with the proper person. In a matter of two months it was clear we wanted to be more than just friends to which we decided to be together. As time moved on, all the laughs, all the eventful times and even frustrating moments we enjoyed together it continued to last for what does seem like it will be the remainder of a lifetime. Each passing month grew into what would soon to be almost 2 years at around the year and 8th month marker. It was a lovely time where I'll never forget when we started to make plans which started with Disneyland and then other plans to just spend time at conventions with video games or other ideas. All of these ideas sparked an overwhelming desire as time moved on, with plans set in motion for months since we started to speak up until now it never really occurred how much we needed to be there in person. Eventually we set our eyes on a Christmas Disneyland getaway vacation since it was a lovely idea. It started to mold together until we finally had the plans set in stone. It was one of the most wonderful adventures that has graced me to come across in my entire lifetime. I'll forever cherish the memories of being with each other for the first time in person when we first saw each other out at the airport. How many tears of joy moments will a person come across in their lifetime? Not many for me but in those moments it makes life worth living for when I am able to move towards being closer with the person I love.

Coming from the family that she did, it's a wonder. She was the family punching bag. Whenever something went wrong, it was Katie's fault. It didn't matter who did it, how it happened, the fact that Katie was in another state at the time -- the entire family, including her two sisters, would gang up and yell at her. So Katie's sister, Krystal, is getting married into a conservative Greek Orthodox family. She's losing her mind because she wants so bad for her new family to think she's perfect, which is laughable, but whatever. Of course, the morning of the wedding, everything is going wrong and how dare Katie do this, despite the fact that Katie wasn't even awake when everything started happening. Makeup if misplaced, boxes haven't been taken up to the church for decorating, the works. So they all load up and head to the church to get the place ready. Katie grabs a box nearly as big as her hauls it into the church, and asks Krystal where it needs to go, to which she responds, \"OH MY GOD KATIE JUST SET IT DOWN SOMEWHERE!\"Katie, being the sweetheart she is, sets it down somewhere out of the way so people won't trip on it, but still in a higher traffic area so it can be found. She goes to put on her dress because some of the groomsmen are putting up the decorations. Of course, Krystal screeches like a banshee not ten minutes later because something in the box Katie had carried in needed refrigeration, but Katie was not informed of that. Not only was it not in the refrigerator, but Katie cleary hid it so nobody else could find it because she was trying to ruin the wedding. Katie apologizes and shows her where the box is. Katie will hold Krystal's bouquet (the other sister couldn't do it for whatever reason -- it was probably too heavy for her poor, dainty arms). So Katie verifies how that's going to work. \"So you give it to me, there's some talking, you and Carl walk around the altar a few times, then I give it back to you?\" Krystal doesn't answer, and after a few more questions, she dismissively says, \"yeah, yeah, you give it back to me.\"During the ceremony, Krystal never makes a move to take the bouquet back, and does not accept it when offered. Katie is yelled at about this after the ceremony. Then they get in a huge fight, katie was so angry, she was crying.

I'd say that's 8 years wasted, down the drain, but my support group says that I need to consider that addiction is an illness that never actually subsides. It will always be there with you, so it's important to be weary of triggers for relapse, but I was still an addict for those 8 years so it's not that I've failed. As you know, a year ago, my mother passed away. After she passed, her house was seized by the bank and that's where I had been living while I try to get my life in order. Karen came to the funeral and when I told her about my issues, she said she had just the thing to pick me up. I shouldn't have been hanging out with her to begin with, but with the passing of my mom, it seemed like she just wanted to reminisce about the good old days and I was really feeling the nostalgia. So, I went to the party with her and in my desperation, started drinking while we were there. It was a wild night, and I really wasn't in a good head space. I ended up passing out on the uber ride home and she had to practically carry me to my bathroom. We tipped the uber pretty well. I woke up on the bathroom floor and immediately regretted my night, but thought.. 'to hell with it' and went to the liquor store right away and stocked up. I drank for about 3 days straight thinking I'd be able to get back on the wagon myself, but those few days of acceptance led to months of acceptance and I found myself at work trying to hide my vodka in a water bottle. When my brother came to visit, he noticed all of the empty bottle in the trash and convinced me to take a week off and go to a rehab facility.

Before the graduation, I had trouble finding parking and rushed into the venue at the last moment, worried I wouldn't be able to find a seat. I found one way up high with pretty poor view because none of the lower ones were available. At that point, I had no idea where my son was, no idea if I would even be able to see him or not. He texted me as the commencement started and told me where he was. Based on that, I was a little upset because I had definitely chosen the opposite side of the arena from him and was very far away. In spite of that, I absorbed the whole ceremony and kept one eye always fixed on his head, small as an ant. The whole time, I balanced between crying with pride and joy and smiling so hard that my cheeks and jaw hurt. In the end, my bad seating location turned out to be central to the single most memorable moment of the night. As the graduates were being released by row to leave the room, I saw that I was sitting directly over the exit that they were filing out through. Everyone around me was standing and I'm not that tall, so as he approached the exit, I got on my toes as high as I could and raised my arm so he could hopefully see me. With about 30 feet to go before he passed under me, he looked up and directly at me and we locked eyes. I will never forget the look he had on his face. It was so almost too special to be described...a combination of pride, joy, thankfulness, humility. Words don't do justice to that little moment we shared. Mother and son loving, knowing and understanding each other without words.", "label": "retold", "group": "NWY0Q9NB"}

Then it happened ,I absently took my eyes off the road and car in the front of me for a second to look, to take in the scenery and when i looked back, the car in front of me had come to a quick stop. I slammed on the brakes, but it was not enough to prevent a car accident. Thankfully no one was hurt , numbers and dollars signs started running through the my heed, as typical for anyone who has been in an accident, but specially so for a wife of a personal finance blogger. So i like to share this information in this time because its the most valuable and memorable event of my life, as well its also an beautiful event  for my life. On that time i felt very bad about that suddenly looked car and shocked a second for avoiding that incident. But god's grace i won't make any damages to that car as well as a people who are all in that road. So that this incident made me to feel proud and teach me a lots of lessons through that single minute, the very worst drawback was i won't wear my seat belts too at that incident happenings, but if the accident happens and I definitely met with the greater injuries because of that worst event. The opposite driver was also a very good driver who has a lots and lots of experience in driving  because he easily control the vehicle in preventing the accident,the major accident was reduced because of that driver's anxiety and smartness. But now a days people won't have that much amount of smartness on the hardest situations, like this driving incident we should have a clear cut of ideas about what we are going to do, because we need a very much of talent in this controlling feelings. so I advice every one to follow the rules and regulations to find the happiness in their life, i recommend everyone to follow the rules after this incident because i experience the clear cut of accident. After that i advice everyone to stay constant and be brave on taking decisions as well as people was also started to believe in my words because of this incident. sometimes i admired those believe which gave to me by the people around me . As well I advice them to teach the traffic rules and create some awareness to the irrespective people like me to avoid the accidents. They also respect my words and started to create awareness among the irrespective and rural people to follow the rules and regulations, it will help their life to be strong and live the stress free life too.", "label": "recalled", "group": "NV7U08HK"}

I was really nervous driving especially since there were so many trees blowing and limbs coming down.  There was also a lot of lightning.  I wasn't sure if I should keep driving or try to find someplace to stop for a while, but all the other cars were still driving so I thought it was ok to keep going.  It was the highway so it seemed safer than smaller local roads.  I was almost home when I saw someone soaked walking on the side of the road.  At first, I felt really bad that I was going to pass this person by because he looked so forlorn.  However, I was nervous about picking someone up because what if they were dangerous.  Also, I wanted to get home as soon as possible.  I don't know what made me stop, but I did and asked the man if he needed a ride.  It turned out to be someone living a few blocks from me.  He didn't want to get in at first and I admit I was nervous, but with all the rain the lightning I tried to convince him it wasn't safe.  He got in and was really wet!  I guess he looked like a businessman so I thought it would be safe.  As I started to drive off, I heard a huge boom and crack!  A tree and lots of branches fell right where my car was and where the man was walking!  It had to be good karma or divine intervention that saved us because we could have been crushed.  This whole experience made me more willing to help others and to reach out because if I were in that same situation, I would want to be helped.  Also, it was just pure luck or some force out there that had me find the man at the right time and drive away at the right moment without getting hit by the tree.  It was a scary even, but it shows that helping others can give you good karma!!", "label": "imagined", "group": "EE9UYQNH"}

The biggest problem for me is not being able to have a normal social life. Most of the people I know, including my friends and family don't have the same problem so it's not easy for them to adapt to me when I'm around. It kills me when I see them laughing at a joke that I did not hear. Whenever I am with other people, I cannot help but feel inferior. I recently talked about it with one of my friends and she told that they try to make sure that I am included but sometimes involuntarily end up forgetting that some one with special needs is around. Moreover, having this disability as a woman is very hard. Other than not having a meaningful social life, my dating life has been hell. I can hardly ever connect with anyone. For someone to date me, they would need to be fluent in sign language and willing to use it all the time to talk to me. It's also worth noting that it's hard to express emotions through sign language so it's hard for me to have an emotional connection with a partner.

He emails an invoice on the last day of every month, which is due within 20 days. I always just pay right away, so there's never been a complaint from his end. Well, he was here at the end of September, but October 13th came around and he still wasn't here. I hadn't paid for October yet simply because I forgot. I had a lot going on, but it's not like it was late. The payment wasn't even due until the 20th. The morning of the 13th, I get this angry email that there will be a late fee for payments made late. So, I immediately grab my invoice to make sure he didn't change the due date on it or something and I missed it. But, nope, it wasn't due till the 20th. So, I shoot him an email saying I had no intention of paying it late, but thanks for the warning, I guess. He ends up sending me four rude emails throughout the day saying that just because the bill says the 20th doesn't mean I have to wait till then to pay it. And, he said he doesn't like to babysit customers and all of kinds of other garbage. I was nice initially, thinking maybe he confused me with someone else. I mean, I've always paid like the day I get the bill. He definitely didn't have me confused. He just kept being rude until I finally sent him back a message telling him basically where he could shove his business and what I thought of him. It really stressed me out.

This was a proud moment for our family, and it was a long journey to get here for our family. It was culmination of years of hard work and dedication from my son and support from us that got him here. I could not have been proud of him if I tried.  So, to make sure we were there to see our son's achievement live, my wife and i took five days off work to ensure that we would be there and to account for any unexpected events. My wife and I would soon find out how useful those extra days would be. First, the rip to the school grounds went a lot slower than we anticipated due to flooding and storms in the area a few days prior. This made road leading downstate to be backed up with traffic and filled with detours that took longer routes. While annoying, the commute was the least for the issues as we would should learn later. Once arriving at the school grounds, we greeted our son and talked to him before we headed to our hotel were we would be staying for two days. When we got to our hotel, we discovered that the hotel was nearly as clean and neat as they advertised.  We weren't pleases, but we were tough old birds and tolerated it. On the day of the graduation ceremony, one last time had to present itself to make this trip as much of a headache as possible. We woke up late because the alarm clock in our room didn't work. So, when we left out to go to the school to be seated, we were already a half-hour. that half-hour made all the difference since finding a parking spot in the school's parking lot was a huge pain. We spent a good 20 minutes trying to a spot--any spot!--to park. By the time we finally found a spot, we only had 10 minutes to get into the building where the ceremony was being held before it started.

Around 5 we departed our room for dinner at the resort's restaurant. The atmosphere was serene and romantic. I handed my wife her gift and when she opened up the box tears fell from her eyes. It was a special bracelet with our children's birthstones. She has been such a great wife and mother that the gift seem a little cheap. We ordered our food which consisted of crab legs, salad, and clam chowder. We wanted it to be a light meal since we were heading the beach club for a night of drinking and dancing. The servers surprised her at the end of dinner with a big slice of chocolate cake and sang happy birthday. Her face seemed to turn red as they danced around the table.

I spent two days searching for her, checking the road, checking the animal shelters, emailing the shelters. I checked the cars to be sure she was not stuck anyplace. I was super upset that she was missing since a different cat had gone missing before only to find out that one of our neighbors must have taken it. This story is about the misadventures of our missing cat. Then I went outside one evening a few days later and Baby Kitty came stumbling out of the garage. She could not stand up at all and her head was tilted to the side. She seemed to be in a lot of distress about not standing up, so I grabbed the cat carrier and off we went to the Emergency Vet, since of course this happened after the normal vets are closed. The emergency vet is not really very close since we live in a rural area, so it took about a half hour of listening to her cry to get there! I was super upset and worried about her since I did not know what was wrong with her. The vet diagnosed her with Idiopathic Vestibular Disease, which is sort of a catch all for a few possible causes, inflammation in the brain, or inner ear infection or a brain tumor. They said the only way to tell if it was a brain tumor was with an MRI, which they don't really recommend as a first step. They suggested trying antibiotics first to see if there was any improvement and hope that it was not a brain tumor! We got antibiotics and came home. Baby Kitty had to spend a week in our bathroom since she could not walk very well and I was concerned she would fall down the stairs! My oldest son had to give her the medicines twice a day while we were on Vacation too, so I was worried about him doing it right. Baby Kitty is doing much better, still a bit wobbly and has a slight head tilt still, so we will have to bring her back to the vet for a follow up. The most memorable event of this whole incident is we still do not know where Baby Kitty was for three days when she was missing. We also don't know if the disease happened because she was stuck someplace or if she got stuck because she lost the ability to walk somehow. This whole incident was super upsetting because the last time we had to go to the Emergency Vet our dog did not make it.", "label": "recalled", "group": "2ZCS1ZT8"}

I scratched my head several times those past few days wondering what I did wrong so I could apologize but I could not place my finger on anything, I tried to assume that being Easter Holidays she must have traveled to her home town. But why did she not tell me? Anyway, I got up and showered quickly and went and picked up my friend and on the way to the hospital he could tell something was off. I decided to open up since we rarely kept anything from each other, I told him how we had spent Christmas together with my girlfriend, for the first time I did not go home to my parents home to celebrate because I wanted to spend it with her, this was also her idea, she did not have to convince me much to do it, I was in love. My friend felt disappointed, he tried to encourage me to just hang in there and everything will be work out for the greater good, this sounded like Greek to me at this point, I just wanted her back. Halfway to the hospital she called, I asked her to call me back in hour after I had checked my friend in the hospital and was free to talk. My heart was racing all the way to the hospital, anxious of what she was about to tell me, were we breaking up? where was she?. Questions and all sorts of reasoning clouded my mind and I could not wait to hear what she had to say. Finally, I was free to call back. I dialed her number and an unfamiliar male voice picked up the phone, I apologized and hang up assuming I had dialed a wrong number, I tried again and got the same voice, I tried to contain my composure and asked him if I could speak to my girlfriend, his answer ripped my heart in a million little pieces! He calmly told me \"his\" fiance was on holiday and he did not appreciate me calling her all the time. I am safely back home now. I just have to rest my head and my heart! It has been a long and stressful day and there is nothing I can do to forget about it. I just hope that tomorrow when I wake I will be level headed and start my healing and moving on journey. I do not know whether I will have the strength or the courage to fight for this love. Only time will tell, I highly doubt it though. Matters of the heart are very complex, no matter what age one is.

The deep reading that used to come naturally has become a struggle.\u201d The impact of interruptions on individual productivity can also be catastrophic. In 2002, it was reported that, on average, we experience an interruption every eight minutes or about seven or eight per hour. In an eight-hour day, that is about 60 interruptions. The average interruption takes about five minutes, so that is about five hours out of eight. And if it takes around 15 minutes to resume the interrupted activity at a good level of concentration, this means that we are never concentrating very well. In August 2018, research from the UK\u2019s telecoms regulator,  reported that people check their smartphones on average every 12 minutes during their waking hours, with 71% saying they never turn their phone off and 40% saying they check them within five minutes of waking.

With our heavy use of digital media, it could be said that we have taken multitasking to new heights, but we\u2019re not actually multitasking; rather, we are switching rapidly between different activities.

His older brother wasnt to happy about the new addition but after we got home he really started warming up to him. He slept the first night at home so peacefully, he didnt wake until about 7 am for feeding. My husband stayed home for the first 2 weeks and my mother in law stayed for 2 weeks after that. He was very quiet and calm, he smiled a lot since the day he was born. He was not a difficult baby at all.  He grew really well, in fact was in the 95th percentile.

Purpose   The purpose of this experiment was to find the empirical formula of a hydrous copper sulfate by finding the percent water, which is done by determining how much the mass of the sample changed after heating it. Finding the percent copper spectrophotometrically using ammonium hydroxide to increase the sensitivity of the technique or method for copper. Lastly, finding the percent of sulfate by precipitating it with barium from added barium chloride. II Procedure\tPercent Water An empty cleaned crucible was on a very high heat in order to remove any substance or left-over samples. Then hydrous sulfate was weighted and added to the crucible and heat it with a gentle flame (approx. 150\uf0b0C). The sample was monitored to maintain a very light blue or white. If the sample is green or yellow the copper sulfate had decomposed; start over. After the sample was cooled, reweight the sample and it must be no more than 2mg.

When I do this we generally have friends and family over to enjoy some bbq and have drinks. Occasionally I will also share with the neighbors and make kind of a big thing out of it. I woke up around 4am the day before she was leaving and got the cooker going. This was easy as I made sure everything was in order and prepared as far as the cooker goes the day before this, all I had to do was start the fire and go in and prep meat. I went inside and prepped about 30lbs of meat to cook. She had some last minute running around to throughout the day, and I stayed back in order to cook.  During this particular cook, these hit their plateau and stayed there. Probably longest plateau I have ever experienced since I have been cooking bbq this way. We pulled them from the cooker at around 10pm-ish and let them rest. When they were ready we shredded/pulled the meat and vacuum sealed all of it for the trip. We had talked back and forth for the first couple days and she never mentioned eating the bbq. I just thought maybe they heated it up and a few people joined them for dinner and really didn't think much of it. I had received some pictures in a text of a big tent set up and tables and stuff.

She is not my mom but I love her for who she is all the same. In the past few months my mother-in-law has been quite ill. In the last month, I learned that she has stage 2 borderline stage 3 lung cancer involving a large mass in the lung. I saw her last week for the first time since her diagnosis when she stopped to spend a night with us while on her to begin cancer treatment. She was in good spirits despite the long journey. She joked about death and mentioned doing her 'dying person' prayers. Being a feminist and an incredibly open-minded person, she was extremely supportive towards me and my unconventional career choices, encouraging me. Everything felt suspended in disbelief and she was filled with more tenderness than usual. In a way this surprised me because she has many reasons to be angry: with her doctors or with life in general for striking her with cancer, in addition to many other misfortunes. She was relaxed and calm and put on a good face but she also looked frail and had lost a significant amount of weight. The next morning she got up early and when we said goodbye to her, she seemed so small and impotent and alone. She looked at both of us directly - her son and me - and somehow I felt that we all understood what is at stake here. As she drove off I wondered if I would see her again. Her visit and seeing her has made me feel many things. I grieve that she has to face this terrible disease and I feel a deep sorrow for my husband, who has been sleeping poorly, worried and more quiet than usual. He would not be who he is today -- respectful towards women, kind, loving, patient -- if it were not for his mother. He does not want to lose her. I feel a sense of total powerlessness in the face of death and the passage of time. I think about how my mother-in-law has lived this amazing, full life, always doing what she wanted even when it was the controversial choice. I think about the vast emptiness of not being able to talk to her again or to be able to email her or see her. I think about how I could have visited her last year but chose not to because it was too cold and rainy where she lived, and I assumed I would have many more chances to see her.

My friend called out to it with a series of \"clucks\" and clicking noises, and it immediately ran to us.  It showed absolutely no fear of my dog as it approached, and went directly to my friend.  He picked it up and it nestled into his arms, clearly enjoying the attention.  He then transferred over to me and nestled into my beard, licking it and playing gently with it.  It was a very young ferret, apparently lost or abandoned, and needed a place indoors.  Since he and my dog got along well, I volunteered to take him in until we found out where he belonged.  I searched online and newspaper lost and found resources, but there was no mention of any owners looking for him.  I recalled seeing a small cage in the dumpster earlier on the day we found him, and had my suspicions that he had been abandoned, but checked with our apartment manager just to make sure.  It turned out that the day prior, a family that had owned a ferret had moved out, also abandoning their dog inside the apartment.  I couldn't believe that someone would commit such an act, and promised my new little friend that he would have his forever home with me.  The abandoned dog had already been picked up by animal control, and I later found out it was adopted out too.  This little ferret is now bonded with me and my family and we couldn't imagine life without the little terror.  Always into whatever is left out, but never misses a chance to make me laugh, or at least smile.  All-in-all this was one of the best days in my recent history, and I wouldn't change it for anything.", "label": "retold", "group": "KQVEWQWD"}

I could not sleep last night because I was so worried about this event and I hoped I was able to support Ben accordingly. How would I react if things don't go to plan? We have spent so much money and time on this. We got there around 6am, traffic was shockingly less than expected! The parking lot was full already but we managed to grab a space thanks to someone leaving. We remembered to take everything along we needed, costume, skates, snacks. Tony, my husband was exhausted and suffering from a cold. My older son, S, was not thrilled about attending this event and wanted to go home. I was hoping I could bribe him to enjoy things by saying he could pick where we ate dinner. Ben was excited and not even remotely nervous. I was a wreck but pretending to be fine! Ben got into costume around 7am, practice ice went well and he seemed happy and content. We then saw the kids he would be competing against and felt a pang of nerves, how could this little kid compete against kids much bigger and stronger than him?! He did not seem phased at all. Another boy and his family were there but they were not remotely friendly, they kept glaring at us which made me feel irritated and also nervous. One of Ben's friends, a little girl skated and did ok but did not win, she came 4th in her event. This made me worry for Ben and start telling myself this whole trip was a waste of money. It was time for Ben to skate and we all held our breath, he did an amazing job and we were not sure if it was good enough to win but it was good. Ben's coach said \"he has got this, he will win\" and we waited for the scores, trying to not get too excited. The scores took forever to be announced but when they were, sure enough, he had won! It was time to calm down and congratulate the other skaters on their skates and try to not appear too boastful. We waited for the medal ceremony but heard nothing. We then had the medal ceremony which was incredibly rewarding and then the event was over! We were exhausted and went home. And it was still only 10:30am!", "label": "recalled", "group": "VI1XFMXE"}

The man I had known my entire life, looked up to my entire life, just no longer existed. Something that I had always known was there, suddenly was not.

I had spent the entire day hanging out in the yard and the hills and decided to go up that evening and dig up some of my childhood toys for the kids and there it was, the pistol my dad bought me when I was a kid. It was a piece of crap, of course; rusted and dusted. A children's toy meant to shoot wooden pellets, something I'm sure the political correctness of this generation would frown on. I brought the gun down from the attic and told my son to come over and bring his friends and I taught them out to use it. They had watched us old fogeys shoot on the range for the better portion of the day, I suppose their turn was coming. The moldy box of pellets still had a few usable pieces of ammunition and I drew a bulls-eye on the side of the house and let them play target practice. A couple of times, I had to warn the kids of the safety of pointing it in each other's face but watching them play with a potentially dangerous yet fun piece of my childhood brought those tears and memories right back to me. The times we had were well spent. The times I'm having with my kid and someone else's kids are also well spent. So, this was when I realized that this is how things are supposed to be.

Moreover, to deal with ICE, immigration court, physical deportation, flying across the world with a toddler in tow, the expense of maintaining two households, only to have my marriage end over something so much ridiculous, is highly frustrating on many different levels. The aftermath of this situation has been constant bickering, anxiety, and loss of sleep. Furthermore, I have come to realize that this man is not the man I thought he was. The financial cost has been an approximate loss of $3500 since I had already secured our return tickets. Psychologically, I am frustrated because I have had to deal with immigration laws while securing permanent residency overseas, which will obviously no longer be happening.

Because our son is so young, it will be many years before he sees his father again, as I will not feel comfortable flying him alone for such a long flight.

I was really ecstatic , what surprised me most was my parents took out time to travel for my special day even though my mum was down with stage 2 cancer. I had series of gifts from my husband and my friends. The love showed to me was unfathomable. I really wanted to get a necklace which i saw at a store some days back and to my surprise it was among the gifts i received. I have never had a surprise birthday party before and this was a new and exciting experience for me. I love my husband but this surprise made me love and cherish him more.

We tried to get state medicaid to cover home care for the problem, but they required her to go to a doctor, which she was not able to do with her condition.  Finally, the problem got so severe that she had a major back spasm that would not relent.  As we had no car, I had to call 911 to get an ambulance to take her to the ER.  There, they verified it was a back spasm related to her herniated disc.  It was an emotionally difficult time for us all.  She was under great pain, so much that she could not speak.  I had to maintain my stress level, as I have high blood pressure, and call to get her treated.  Then, we were told that she would STILL have to go to her PCP to get treatment, but at least they gave her enough pain meds to get her there.  Over the weeks that would follow, there would be many, many consultation visits, scans, and lab works.  It was not easy, but they did finally get her on good meds, a back shot, and therapy...back at the ER that would not allowed to treat us at the start without all of this run around.

It all started six months prior when I saw a family friend that I hadn't seen in awhile.  As soon as I saw him, my heart started pounding.  My stomach dropped to the floor and, of course, I had to pee right away.  All of the bad memories assaulted my mind in a matter of seconds.  The way he had sexually assaulted me those many years ago.  All of a sudden, it seemed like it had happened just seconds before.  So that was the day that holding my pee became a problem.  I wet myself and left in quite a hurry.  It was positively humiliating to me but I'm pretty sure no one else noticed because I left so quickly.  So now, it's a common problem.  I never know when it's going to hit me, but as soon as the flashbacks happen, the urge to pee always follows and I feel frozen in place trying to hold my pee.

I recall browsing around the store (was about 2 months or so ago) and my mother just looking/sifting through knick knacks and whatnot. I then remember seeing this old woman with an interesting but odd set of clothing on her in the store. I didn't think too much of it, but a pretty unique and memorable experienced soon occurred. While my mother was paying/in-line and I was just waiting for her, I came across/walked right beside this old woman with the unusual attire (sort of like a flashy/unusual blouse; her hair done in an upright/spiky-esque way; colored pants; some ornaments on her shoulders and etc.). I remember reaching out for something near the woman (not on purpose) and me grabbing something that interested me, but then I had dropped it. The old woman right away bent down and picked it up for me. I thought nothing of it, but just thanked her and she continued to walk past me. Soon after she turned back and started engaging in conversation with me. She did speak mostly Spanish, but when realizing I didn't know much of it, she changed to English and could speak it somewhat well. I remember this experience with her to have somewhat of a \"feel\" of \"ambiance\" to it with her. I felt pretty much in an odd but not uncomfortable situation when conversing with her. She had some sort of \"air\" to her if you will. She mostly only talked about religion (she was Christian) and such. She finished the conversation off by grabbing my hand and smiling, saying something to the tone of, \"God loves you in his own way,\" or such. She then walked off and I then proceeded to leave with my mother, talking briefly about the experience/exchange with the woman. While I didn't talk about it once or feel it to be particularly special at the time, I kind of felt that it was pretty unique and interesting how we conversed back and forth (the woman was pretty calm and understanding -- not hesitant or in a rush or anything and basically very casual/comfortable speaking and such). I soon thought back to the event and that somehow made it feel more unique as some time had passed. Basically, the idea from this experience was that it was special in both the unusual attire of the woman -- and in her absolute kindness/peace/exchange experience with her.

Before this, I was not really that into listening to classical music or anything of the sort. Obviously, I was aware of such famous composers as Beethoven, but during this performance I was introduced to many new artists. One of my favorite pieces that was played is called \"Fantaisie Impromptu\", by Chopin. It really is impressive how fast the song is, and just the scale of notes that are played with both hands at the same time. Another great piece of music that was played is called \"Amoreena\", by Elton John. I was never a fan of Elton John, but I remember hearing his music in movies and thinking it always blended very well. This song stuck with me because the piano melody in it is very well executed. I never liked this song when I was a kid; but now, looking back it was more original than anything coming out now a days. One of the mysterious pieces I happened to enjoy was called \"Asturias\" by Isaac Albeniz. It reminded me of people running into a battle that nobody wanted to fight but everyone had to. When I first heard it, I remember thinking, how can someone think of making music like this? Well, The last piece of music I can remember hearing at this performance was Beethoven's \"Sonata No. 23\". As anyone would guess, it was a great piece of music, developed by one of the greatest composers. I can very much say that I am now permanently a fan of classical piano. I encourage everyone to seek out the great composers of the past, and find pieces of music they can assimilate with.", "label": "recalled", "group": "1FR8VKNA"}

About 20 minutes later of chaos and panic we got a call from housekeeping. My brothers friend who is almost 30 years old was passed out drunk in the closet where they keep extra chairs and tables. After he was confronted he began to cry about his drinking problem. This lead to a quick chat about him and who he was and what he needed to do. We didnt have him in the wedding and just went with an uneven number of groomsmen and bridesmaid's. I havent heard from my brothers friend in awhile nor about him but it was very eye opening.

The weather was perfect except for one day, when it rained hard. Tom and I used that time to go to a local cultural museum, which I felt right at home at. I enjoyed learning about the history of the Bahamian people. There were several events that we enjoyed participating in during our stay. Every night there was a dinner where you could eat with other couples. We made these wonderful friends, Jim and Sue, who were our companions throughout the trip. My favorite events were the late night parties. There was dancing under the light of the fire from the tiki torches. The DJ was talented and played a great mix of music, including hits and deep cuts.

The nurse I was working with advocated for me to be in the room to assist with the birthing process. I remember how long it took and how tiring it was for the patient to push for over two hours in order for the baby to come out. It was all so beautiful.

{"id": "3TPWUS5F8ANSKQR680LU3NAWM83WCN", "text": "Three months ago, I was there to witness something that I had been occasionally thinking about since the first day that I had become a father. My son stood tall and proud in an Eagle Scout ceremony. The day started out as usual, I said good morning to my son and asked him how excited he was for his big day. He responded exactly like I thought he would, casual, but not wanting to hurt my feelings. Ever since he was young, being an Eagle Scout is something that he\u2019s been interested in. I was an Eagle Scout myself when I was younger but I made sure that I didn\u2019t push the idea onto him; this is something that I wanted him to do through his own free will. We both finished getting ready and headed to the ceremony. We arrived and went our separate ways, him to the scout area so that he could get ready and myself to the bleachers were an abundance of prideful parents sat. Though there was nothing particularly special or different about this ceremony, I just couldn\u2019t help but feel so proud of my son standing on that stage. He\u2019s worked hard for this moment and it\u2019s something that really means something to him. The most memorable part about it to me was when they had each scout walk up to the microphone and explain what being an Eagle Scout means to them personally. A lot of the answers were expected and a little generic, but when he stood on that stage and began to speak, you could tell that he really meant every word of what he was saying. It brought me back to the days of my youth. All of the times I spent with my scout mates, the hard work that we put ourselves through to be the best that we could be; it was almost overwhelming. For that hour long ceremony, I felt like I had gone back in time. Though I would never tell my son this directly due to the fear of embarrassing him, I see a lot of myself in him; and this experience in my life has done nothing but confirm it. After all was said and done, the ceremony proceeded to end. I stepped off of the bleachers and patiently waited. He walked up to me and I gave him the biggest hug I have in a while. He excitedly told me everything that had been going on behind the scenes and I told him how proud I was of him and how glad I was that he\u2019s found something that truly makes him happen at this early stage in his life. We left the ceremony area and headed back to the car so that we could go home. I\u2019d like to believe that I\u2019ve been doing my best as a father but no one is perfect. My son has grown into a fine young man and though I probably could have done better in some aspects, I am incredibly proud of him. Being an Eagle Scout isn\u2019t something that means much to most, but to us, it\u2019s an honor and a privilege.

And I wasn't even aware of it. That was very eye opening to be honest. But I pulled through and got over it. It was also shocking that some family members weren't there. All that mattered to me was my immediate family. I was able to take it one day at a time. I wish I could go back into time with my grand mom.

Although we visit several kinds of places such as Senior Citizens Daycare Centers, Schools for Disabled Children and Assisted- Living Homes, our favorite place to visit is Shriners Children Hospital.  When Sheriff and I do our weekly visit we actually put on a program in the hospital's auditorium. It is always amazing to me to see these happy children faces when I know they are battling serious, and sometimes terminal illnesses.  Just being in these children's presence is such a blessing and reminds me to appreciate each day. The program Sheriff and I do is quite interactive with the children, so when someone doesn't participate it is quite noticeable. About 6 months ago I would notice a young girl, probably about 7 years old, standing off to the side. She looked incredibly lonely and sad. I have learned over time to let the kids approach us or Sheriff as they deemed to be comfortable. Each week I would hold eye contact with  her for a little longer and subtly move a little closer to this girl, whose name I later learned is Rebecca.  It took about 4 weeks to get close to Rebecca, and finally one day when we were close I asked her if she would like to pet Sheriff. She approached us in a shy manner and gently put her hand on Sheriff's back. The following week she actually walked up to Sheriff and gave him a big hug. My heart felt so much overwhelmingly love for this girl. As time went on I spoke with Rebecca often and felt we had become close. It was with a heavy heart when I received a phone call from the director who asked is Sheriff and I would visit Rebecca in her room. She had become gravely terminal. It was a day of love but one of extreme sadness as well. Rebecca's mom told me that one of Rebecca's wishes was to see Sheriff. She told me that Sheriff brought so much happiness to Rebecca. That day I knew the power of Therapy Dog and what a difference they make in people's lives.", "label": "retold", "group": "KJ4R0YQC"}

I am not sure what participated this change, likely it was because my son started middle school and his personality has become much more defiant. I'd expected some personality changes as my son moved past elementary school but it's been really beyond the pale. I should have expected worse. Anyway, our relationship reached an all-time low in October as my son flippantly told me that he was going to go to a Halloween party with his friends from school as if he didn't need my permission. I don't know all of these friends and I don't know the parents where the party was going to be hosted. I voiced my concerns to my son. I told him that I had to check first before agreeing to anything. I thought it was a minor and reasonable thing but my son raised his voice and accused me of being controlling. He stormed upstairs to his room and I followed him trying to explain the issue that I have with him being up at all hours with people I don't know. James apparently had enough and he slammed his bedroom door shut, nearly hitting my face in the process. Now, I try to be patient when dealing with my son but this was too much for me. I admit I shouted and my voice was several decibels higher than what it should have been. I shouted at James that avoiding me isn't going to solve the problem and slamming his door just meant that he is going to lose his privacy. I collected myself, went downstairs to the basement, grabbed a screwdriver and hammer, and went back to James' bedroom door. I had his door off its hinges in about 30 seconds. With privacy being one of the most important things to James, this was intolerable to him. He acted as if the world was ending. However, I stood firm and explained that actions have consequences and shutting the door in my face means that he loses his door until he can close it properly. I'd expected this to be a short term, temporary thing, but it seemed to have brought about a change in James. He calmed down over the next few days and we actually had a pleasant dinner for once.  I put the door back on its hinges a few days later and James hasn't slammed his door since. We still have our differences but I think James now knows how to work on them a bit more constructively.", "label": "imagined", "group": "6VQEMYFI"}

He had been ill with dementia and physically deteriorating for a while but I still wasn't prepared to lose him. He was mentally declining and most of the time he would just sit in his chair and go in and out of a mental fugue state. The last time I saw him was six days before he died. He was already in hospice care and depressed. I showed him a picture of my newborn son and we talked about baseball. It was his favorite sport and he loved to watch the Detroit Tigers. He was very lucid and aware. He talked to me about how much he still missed Verlander since the trade and that he hoped the Tigers would have a good year despite losing so many players. He then told me that my baby looked like my wife. It was a very emotional day. His death really taught me to appreciate every moment of every day. I had spent so much of my time rushing through life that I never bothered to consider that it will eventually end. There will be some people who will really miss me after I am gone. I inherited money from his estate and invested the bulk of it. One of my most fond, recurring, memories from when I was a child was going to my grandparents lake cottage and spending weekends and vacations there. To honor my grandfather and provide my own children that kind of experience I purchased a cottage this summer, on a lake about an hour and a half drive away. On weekends we all go up there and relax. My daughter loves the beach and just sitting out in the shady yard. My little one is scooting around the place pretty good and likes to go sit under an umbrella and play in the sand. Every time I am there I think about my grandfather and wish so very, very much that he could be there to enjoy this with us. At times it feels like he is there. I firmly intend to instill all the values that I learned from him over the years.

But my excitement was ephemeral because ,my husband didn't even seem to notice me that day , he had this kind of stern look on his face and told me that he would be travelling that same day.

I later gave up and said to myself well , \"This should be the worst birthday ever\".When i got home , i was exhausted and famished , on entering the door i had a loud shout of \"Happy birthday\", i can say i literally ran off my skin , tears of joy overwhelmed me .I was totally swept off my feet , to my surprise i saw my husband , which i later knew he was feigning the serious look and the travel plan , i was really excited ,my colleagues and supervisor were all there. What was really memorable was the birthday song my kids sang for me and the flowers they presented and also the fact that my mom was able to make it despite the fact that she was critically ill.

When I walked in I scanned the hall and saw him sitting at a table this was it. In my head I was concerned\"is that really him or is my head playing tricks on me\".

We paid for everything and planned everything on our own, which I think adds to memory of our special day.

I've heard a lot of stories about how the day flew by and that they never took the time to actually enjoy it. A lot of people regret the decisions they make when it comes to their wedding day. They wish they would have had a smaller or a less expensive wedding. A lot of my friends and family believe they wasted a large sum of money on one single day and ended up being in debt afterwards. We took all of those stories and we decided to not let that be our story. We bought everything with cash, nothing as a loan or on credit. We made our own smorgasbord of food and desserts. We treated it like Thanksgiving. It was awesome and delicious. We worried less about being flashy and classy and more about being comfortable and memorable. We wore what we wanted and didn't have a dress code for our guests. There was no rehearsal dinner, no huge reception. We told people to come as you are and bring their own drinks. Everyone really enjoyed just relaxing, eating good food, and letting loose.

I ended up getting a call from my best friend, asking me if I could watch his son while he and his wife went out for a date night. I love that kid like he was my own, so I was happy to accept. Another plus, is that I get snacks and dinner for doing it. It's a win win. I didn't think to check the weather, as it seemed promising all that day. As soon as the kid and I were alone, however, it started to rain. And then the rumbling thunder accompanied by frequent flashes of lightning. To make it better, the storm cell was right over our town, so we got to hear it from right underneath. I hate storms, and have an irrational fear of them. I put on my best brave face, but I think flinching every time I saw lightening, or heard thunder gave me away. The kid, awesome as he is, had me sit down with him, and told me that playing games helps take your mind off of things you're scared of. Responding without thinking, I told him it was good advice. He just gave me a look, and said that I told him that all of the time when he's scared. I almost wanted to manly cry, I was so flattered. I ended up laughing, instead, thankfully. He then told me that even when I was an old man in a thunder storm, he'd always be there to play games with me. Like I said, I love this kid like he were my own, and I'm thankful that he thinks of me as family, and we'll always be in each others' lives.", "label": "imagined", "group": "R5VCPA6P"}

She was the kind of person that was a bit reserved, but we convinced her to have the party after a bit of prodding and promising not the go too far (*fingers crossed*). The setting for the party was a hotel in a nearby town, and about 20 people were there to celebrate. As soon as the person of the night came, the drink were being slung, and the party was jamming. It was about 70 minutes into the party that things started to get a bit crazy. One of our friends saw when she came into the hotel that a buggy was parked in the parking lot of the hotel. We all thought it would be fun to leave the hotel room and to drive around town enjoying the starry night sky.  We didn't have a care in the world at that point, and the bride-to-be was completely into the whole thing. I'd never seen her as into something as she was at that moment sitting next to me in that buggy driving through town in the dead of night.  But things soon turned a bit serious when we ran into a group of guys returning from a hike. These were college aged guys, so they were young and, admittedly, a bit handsome. They saw how tipsy we were and probably thought we were an easy lay. Alcohol and cautious thinking don't mix, so a few of our friends who were very drunk decided to go with the guys to party before heading home. It  wasn't until the next morning that we heard what happened. Apparently, they woke up feeling like they were given something other than alcohol. They fear that they may have been assaulted, so they went to the police to file a report. Hopefully nothing happened, but they haven't gave me or anyone else in our group an update since they filed that police report.", "label": "imagined", "group": "6ONKCIVA"}

My sister really wanted to reply that my mother had her husband for 20 more years than she did but did not want to stoop to her level. Whenever they do speak on the phone, it generally ends with my sister being upset by something my mother did or didn't say to her. I try to be supportive of both of them but it is very difficult. I always read that death brings out some interesting sides of your family but never guessed it would be this devastating to live through. I pray it gets better but in reality think it will end up that they continue to not speak to each other that often. I feel put in the middle of a situation that is out of my control. My other sister is just as bad about not being supportive. She told me that our other sister was never really a sister to her. This escalated during our parents anniverary celebration 8 years ago. There was a heated exchange between the two of them. Unfortunately that was the dagger in the coffin that caused them not to talk to each other for a long time.

So we did the best we could considering we didn't even have sleeping bags much less a tent. We arrived at the campsite where our friends were already. The place was serene and had a good atmosphere but the heat was unbearablly hot. There was no place to hide from the heat. We didn't move much during the day at all and hoping that the sun would go down quicker than usual. We took short hikes around the campground just to see what type of facilities were there. Not much in the form of relief from the heat. Well the sun finally went down and then we had to deal with the mosquitoes. I hate mosquitoes. Fortunately we did bring insect repellant and our friends saw that we were a bit frustrated about the whole thing. Our friends started a bonfire and that was wonderful. That took away the mosquitoes and was warming the coolness of the night. We drank beer and told stories of our past and then had a good time from that point on. I am glad it lasted only two days because I just am not cut out to be a big time camper like my friends. Me and my wife were surprised at the empathy that our friends took on us. I felt that they had been in the same position when they first started out camping as well. Me and my wife learned a lot about ourselves and our friends during that lost weekend of our lives.

It was nerve-wracking, but all my dedication had led me to this moment, this sensation of displaying my success in front of these thousands. It was Graduation Day, and nothing could have felt better than owning up to the last four years of my life, and seeing the fruit of that labor. The dean and president began their speeches, lovely poems and quotes about embracing the future making up the bulk. I couldn't see my family, however, I knew they would be looking for me once I am called to receive my diploma. The clapping that took place after the speeches could have triggered an earthquake, or maybe just my senses were heightened on this occasion. The air was crisp and cool, with the overcast sky darkening the ceremony it was very relaxing. I had done it, and now my life is truly ready to begin. What awaited, I did not know, and to be honest, I did not care. In that moment all that mattered was taking in the sights that are once in a lifetime. Only once would I be on this stage that was foretold about for years. Ever since I could remember, College was this distant place that would somehow change my life. However, now I can see that that is the truth; reflecting on the ways I have grown and matured, it really is surreal. All those years of sitting in a classroom validated in a single moment, it was overwhelming. This was a moment that I would reflect on forever, an eternity of waiting to lead up to the rest of my life. How could I not enjoy this?", "label": "recalled", "group": "HCWNOIM3"}

So I hopped in my car and took the 7-8ish hour drive to the house and the adventure began. I got there as the second person, so for a  day it was just a few of us chilling. The next day more people started filing in and we went out to eat for the first time. The third day is is when things really ramped up as we ordered a huge 40 inch pizza and the bulk of the people that I connected with the most arrived. The next day we went to a pretty dope arcade as a group and the rest of the people that were coming arrived as well. We were in a packed house full with 13 people and it was crazy. People were sleeping everywhere imaginable. The next day, the 13 of us went out to eat, partook in some weed and played some video games like Jackbox and Smash Ultimate. We did so many little things like eating out as a cool kids group of us, went to a gaming bar, shopped at Wal-Mart at like midnight and just so many little fun moments I won't forget. People started leaving on Saturday, so we light off some fireworks in celebration. The last day I was there the few of us left went out to eat and then I took off to head home in the afternoon.

I have for about 6 months now noticed a sudden change of behavior, everything we shared and enjoyed together all of a sudden doesn't make sense to her anymore. She now complains about almost everything, on days when i call regularly she complains of me disturbing her. On days when i'm too busy to call however she says i'm not been caring enough. I later found out she was seeing another person who happened to be someone i knew and they were both trying to hide the relationship from me. It was had pill to swallow but life most go on. What i'm still trying to wrap my head around is why she didn't just break up instead of the torments she was putting me through. She basically sits around all day doing nothing, she resigned from work about 5 months ago and i've been responsible for most of the stuffs we both need and i still get cheated and insulted, i don't know what i've done to deserve this but i know their sweeter things laying in future for me. I don't know how long this would take to heal but i know it will someday. I am seriously not considering dating anyone in the nearest future.

I prepared for the interview, and felt with my background and experience I would be selected for the job. I sat through the interview answering all questions posed to me and answering them in detail with complete honesty. The interview seemed to go well, with the interviewer conversing quite a bit with me on a business and personal level. The interview lasted about 45 minutes, which by all accounts from others is a good thing. After about 2 weeks of anxious waiting, I was told I did not get the job. What struck me as memorable about this was the fact that on a previous follow up interview I had been told the decision came down to me and one other candidate, which led me to believe the interviewer had liked my qualifications. Also, the waiting with anticipation was agonizing, everyday walking in hoping to hear one way or the other on their decision.  This really knocked down my confidence level in a number of ways. First, it absolutely destroyed any faith I had in the company and its managers honesty, I did a follow up interview and was told the interview went well, obviously not well enough. Secondly, this really lowered my confidence in myself my abilities and my experience. Lastly the experience soured me on the company as a whole, because it showed me that hiring within is done almost exclusively through the buddy system, and I am on a shift that does not allow you to make good contacts.", "label": "recalled", "group": "GS5GKP10"}

I felt hopeless and really depressed, unable to imagine myself being able to become independent. I wasn't healthy enough to get a \"real\" job but I wasn't sick enough to get disability assistance from the government. I almost felt like there wasn't a point in living. There was so much I wanted to do in life, but I really couldn't see a way to achieve them. What's the point in trying to save money just so I can survive? I was sick of feeling so helpless so I started looking online for jobs I could do. I didn't have much hope that there was anything that could actually help my situation. However, I was desperate enough that I would accept tasks for lower than minimum wage if I could earn a few extra hundred dollars a month. Even one hundred extra a month would take a burden off of me.

At this point, I felt like I had nothing to lose so I just put together a mediocre CV and applied for the job. I didn't keep my hopes up and decided to forget about it.

I cannot believe how certain I was that the job was going to be offered to me. I still don't know what happened there. One reason why I was so depressed was that I lost my confidence. I told to myself, \"If I cannot even get a job after a good interview, how is this going to ever work for me?\"Early September, I took a week off and went camping. Oh, how much I needed this vacation. I was out in the mountains, where I did not have any cell phone connection. I spent my days reading my books and just enjoying the nature. I didn't go hiking or kayaking. I simply took my time to relax and recharge. This vacation helped me get over my depression. I came back to my home and to my work with a completely new perspective. I like my job, but my job, or any job I may get in the future, does not define me. The real life that makes me happy is out there in the wilderness. I will keep working to be able to afford living a comfortable life and to continue to enjoy nature and outdoors. I feel much better now.", "label": "retold", "group": "GHBT8C0K"}

On her birthday I and my husband decided to make it  memorable one for her and the kids by buying a sugar glider to surprise on her birthday. she had always a pet the kids had all been yearning for a pet. so six months ago we started preparing for her big day, we bought cakes, drinks and lots of stuff so the children that came to celebrate with Anabel would have fun. On the day of her birthday it turned out she had a flu due to the cold that season, so she was not really in a great mode. the other children were expecting to see a vibrant and playful Anabel, but she was dull and moody. so we decided to make her feel better by showing her the surprise we had for her. when she saw the sugar glider she was so excited that it felt like she was not even sick in the first place. Everyone invited to my youngest daughter's birthday party had a great time, even though it was cold. They got to play with a sugar glider and see it jump on my oldest daughter's head. My youngest daughter (the birthday girl) surprised everyone by take a few steps in-front of them. She showed them how to pat the sugar glider properly.

The airport in my home state featured a mish-mash of people from all cultures and backgrounds. It was noisy, crowded, and full of people looking around and in some sort of rush. Compared to the airport I touched down in North Carolina, the people there were mostly of one race (white), it was sparse, and the airport was quiet.

It was well after dark when we decided together whoever got the first job on the mainland the other would follow. That\u2018s when I realized that the little glass sculpture was still in my pocket! I took it out  of the little box and I showed it to her.  I told her, I forgot to give this to Cheryl during the birthday party, I\u2018ll get her something else later. I said to her seriously, \u201cThis scuplture represents the delicate beginnings of our friendship and the tendrils of colors are the future events that we will experience together as our lives weaves together.\u201cI put it back in the box and handed it to her while saying, \u201cPlease be gentle.\u201cAfter about a year upon graduating, I got a job first in Seattle WA, Lola did come, and agreed to marry me.

Since I lost my home, the best paying job I have ever had, all of my material items, my family, several friends, my kids temporarily and any thing else I could lose, I found I was starting to lose my self-confidence, my faith and even myself. I lost everything I cared about, was mentally and physically abused, heart-broken, homeless, hungry and lost. This continued on for years with little to no change or progress, no matter what I did or how hard I tried. Feeling the most lonely, sad. tired and hopeless I have ever felt in life, I started to give up.  About a month ago, however, I was shown just how fast life can turn around. I woke up one day that was looking to be just as empty and hopeless as every other day, oh how life is full of surprises! I was randomly blessed with a home after being homeless for years. Someone payed to first few months bills for me, got me moved in and helped me see a light at the end of the tunnel. My kids will be back home with me soon and I am starting to find myself again!

It was pretty dark out this night, whereas the moonlight would usually light my way. That being said, driving conditions were a bit below optimal. On top of that, I was tired from working most of the night. About half way through the drive home, A large semi truck pulled out in front of me from an intersection not too far ahead. I could tell instantly that he did not see me coming, and I slammed on my breaks. Unfortunately, It was too late. I slid right into him at about 30 miles per hour, right on the front left of my car to the corner of his back bumper. My left shoulder and arm were fractured, but my car was completely destroyed. I was devastated, I had never been in an accident before this. I really had no idea what would happen if I would even be able to get to work the next day. The truck driver got out and told me he works for Coca Cola. He said he had to call his supervisor in to bring insurance information, and to get mine. I called the police and reported the accident while waiting for the supervisor to show up. Once the supervisor was there, we exchanged insurance information, and I asked him if he could give me a ride home. Luckily, he said yes. It wasn't even until the next day that I realized how serious my injuries were. My shoulder and arm received 2 different types of fractions from hitting the dashboard. I woke up with immense pain, feeling unable to go to work that night. I went to an urgent care facility at around 6 pm and they knew right away my left arm and shoulder were either broken or fractured, or both. I set up an appointment with a doctor, and eventually ended up with a cast for 9 months. All in all, I am glad I had the experience because my injuries hurt very bad, but they weren't severe enough to change my life for the worse.

This was incredibly hard for me because dogs to me are not just dogs, they are treasured family members, it was losing a family member to me. I also just could not believe that this was happening. I took her to the Veterinarian three weeks ago for what I was assuming would be allergies, only for them to tell me that she had lumps that had to be tested. We did a blood test and a biopsy and the results came back as Lymphoma, as rather aggressive form. I took her to a specialized Canine Oncologist, which I did not even know existed, to find out what Ginny's options were. It was disappointing for me to learn that at  best, she had about nine months to live, but if I put her through Chemotherapy, they had a large chance of being good months. I put a lot of thought into it, and ultimately decided that it was worth it to try Chemo, if there was a chance I could give her some more good time, I would. I took her to her first treatment and everything seemed to go well, she was in treatment for the afternoon, I was able to pick her up after work. When I picked her up it was like I had the old Ginny back, she was lively and engaging and so excited about her meal, which she had not been for a while. These feelings of normalcy lasted for two days, by the time she was due for her next treatment, she was just as tired and worn out as she had been. I was told that this was normal, but I was not sure, it seemed like Ginny was not having the responses that she should have. When I picked her up from the second treatment, she was off, she was not lively like the first time, she just seemed exhausted. Later that night I had to call the animal ER to answer questions about Ginny's condition, she was refusing food and water and just seemed so sick. By the next day her symptoms only intensified, she became incontinent. I decided that this was an indignity that she should not have to suffer, she was having a terrible quality of life and I needed to do right by her.

I got excited because that meant there might be decent fishing. We finish our hike (looping back to this bridge again) by mid afternoon. I get my stuff out and rigged up and start tossing bugs. Every offering, this fish beneath the bridge would short strike but never take. I switched to an ant and had my son grab it and let go. I figured it was time to let him cool down because I thought I could catch him on that pattern, but he had seen it too much to take it at that point. I went downstream, fishing the seams and holes I could find. As I walked downstream surrounded by these sequoias 40 feet around, I came to this pool at the end of a run. It looked fishy. You know what feeling when you're fishing new water but you get to a spot and laugh to yourself that if there's no fish in there you might as well pack it up now? It was that king of spot. I toss out my ant pattern from before, right at the bottom of the run before it opens up into a slow slow drift over a hole that was at least three times deeper than any hole I had seen up to that point. I look down to manage my line and prepare for a couple of mends to get that fly to drift perfectly through that hole. When I looked up I saw the silhouette of what would be considered Jaws in this tiny stream. He was nearly at my fly and then he pounded that thing. Not some measly sip. This big boy knew how to eat. I got a great hookset and it was game on. Within the first ten seconds this fish had launched itself two full body-lengths out of the water three times. It was an absolute rocket. It had all the room in the world to swim down because the pool was so deep, and then launch itself straight out of the water like it was straight out of Cape Canaveral. My son had assisted me by pulling the fish out of water, we had both fell back and on the dock.

I finally got tired of it and asked for a divorce.  Unfortunately, we have two kids together and we thought it would be in their best interest if the children remained with him, so now I will see my kids far less often. I've not been happy for more than a few years now and I continually tried to bring up that I was unhappy and the exact reasons as to WHY I was unhappy he would basically tell me that he was going to change or fix it but it would never come to pass, or if he DID attempt to make it better it would only last a few days before reverting back to the exact same patterns and behaviors that made me unhappy.  He'd promised to get a job for years, but never made the effort, yet at the same time he didn't want ME to get a job either because he wanted to be the man of the house and be the provider.  I'd had that same conversation with him over and over again over the course of our marriage and that was only one reason that led to my decision to divorce him. This all finally came to a head when he asked me what we were doing.  He was upset that I had been spending more and more time in front of the computer actually attempting to work and actually making money and it was only during THIS conversation that he FINALLY raised the issues he'd been having with me.  Issues that had been going on for some time but just had never seen fit to actually tell me before then even though I would specifically ask if he had any issues with me, anything that I could change every time I tried to bring up the issue that I was unhappy and the exact reasons WHY I was unhappy.  His entire family seemed to think it a shame that I was spending more and more time in front of the computer, again actually attempting to work and bring in money, but not ONE of those people saw fit to actually say anything to me about it.  I brought up the fact that I constantly asked him if there were any issues he needed to bring to my attention after every discussion I had and he would always say no that he just wanted everyone to be happy, which I clearly wasn't.  He eventually said that he would try and start telling me things, the good and the bad, but by that point I was just done.  I'm quite sure it surprised us both when I said no and that I thought it would be best if we parted ways.  I've discovered that the most surprising thing of it all is that I don't feel upset about divorcing him, just more about not getting to see my kids as often as before.

On our way home we stopped by our local bakery to pick up a cake for the celebration that we had planned.

However, she is really a good musician and knows a lot.  She just has no boundaries with her personality.  Most of us avoid her because she talks on and on even if no one is listening.  But there is one man in our group who is very kind.  He has a background in special education.  He decided to be very affirming of her one night.  He told her when she played something well, and he listened when she talked. He encouraged her where her talents lay.  His kindness helped her to blossom that night and I watched with interest.  It reminded me to be a better person and pay some attention to this often clueless musician even when I don't want to.  I think about this from time to time when I am in contact with people who are difficult to be around.

I enjoyed the wedding immensely and you could tell not much had changed there. The resort is a beautiful place, I felt as though I was welcomed right away, and I really enjoyed the food.

Of course, this became the worst experience of my life.

When i got off he was screaming in pain and of course i called 911 as soon as and so did neighbors that had seen what happened. The ambulance and police were there in no time and got the child to safety. While all this happened they took my licence and information and witness statements.

This is or was odd for me because I've never given much thought to participating in a marathon. Nevertheless, the videos were interesting enough to make me start seriously consider training for one. After watching the videos, I started looking at workout videos - specifically, cardio workouts - to use to build up my endurance. I knew to steer clear of HIIT or high impact workouts because I didn't work out regularly. And as an older adult, I didn't want to risk hurting myself. So I settled on a few low-impact routines. I started small with a 15-minute routine.  It seemed easy enough while watching it, but some of the movements were challenging for me as a newbie. Still, I persevered.  And within a few weeks, I decided to move up to a 30-minute routine. It, too, was a little challenging. However, I was able to adjust to 15 addition minutes fairly quickly. During this time, I noticed that I had more stamina than normal. And I also lost a few pounds, which proved to be very motivating. So I started pushing myself little by little. For example, I started walking three miles a day a few times week. And once I got used to three miles, I moved up to four, five, six, seven and now I'm up to eight miles. I'm proud of myself because I've gone from being a pretty sedentary person to a highly active person within six months. And I'm looking forward to participating in my first half-marathon next year.

I recall lying in the hospital bed on the good meds they give you there, watching Netflix and napping most of the time. It was rather pleasant, all things considered.

The real reason was because she was questioning her sexuality, and the wedding day was just the necessary straw to break the camel's back. It was quite a shocker for us. We did not know she was a bisexual and had a girlfriend on the side. Apparently she didn't know the extent of her love until the day of the wedding. We wondered if the groom knew as well.  While I was not a close friend of hers, I was not well known of her sexual preference. While I do not think it was a good idea to run away during wedding day, I do not agree with a wedding where vows are made and the infidelity would have started from day 1. I then followed up with what's her plan now. She plans to move away from the town within the next month. She dumped both the groom and the girlfriend soon after her fiasco.

This kid is Asian and the other boys were making comments about his race but it was obvious that they were mostly intimidated by him because he consistently outperformed them in the class. This boy was a excellent student in both math and science and and he was also getting all A's in his other classes . The boys that were picking on him spent much of the their time in class goofing around and it was a daily struggle to get them to do their work. There were 4 boys in particular that seemed to spend quite a bit of time together and not much was spent focusing on their school work. I began to notice that they would be especially disruptive and bully the boy when it was close to test time and I was working to prepare the class. It seemed that since they were not doing well in the class that they felt the need to disrupt the entire class and be especially mean to the boy that was leading the class. I began speaking to the boys individually about their behavior and tried to get them to see how they were behaving and to instead focus on their schoolwork. The asian boys parents came to talk to me about the behavior as their son was hurt by the way he was being treated. The parents said they were concerned and asked that the school discipline the group of boys that were bullying their son, I again spoke with the group of boys , mostly individually to let each of them know that they should be focusing more on their school work and that what they were doing was not kind and instead hurtful. I could tell they understood , some more than others at first but it seemed that this approach began to make a difference as I began noticing each of them become more thoughtful and less concerned about how much better the boy they were bullying was doing than them in the class. I began offering tutoring to anyone that wanted extra help and one by one each of the group of bullies began asking for help. They had become aware that they were jealous and simply needed to work harder.

After almost 2 hours of sitting in this horrible snow traffic the driver suddenly turned down a side road. I was going to ask where he was going but I figured who cares at this point.

Well, most parts were beautiful; some parts had obvious homeless and drug problems.  But the wedding itself was gorgeous and everyone had a great time.  This was my cousin from my mother's side of the family.  I'd known her since I was a small boy and we'd always been really close.  She wanted me to be in the wedding in some capacity but I had work obligations that made that impossible so I could only be a guest.  But we were both content that I just made it; I can't fathom having missed it.  Anyway, the wedding was held inside in a church.  My cousin wore a gorgeous white wedding dress with a long train.  I thought it was really classy, while still being modern and sexy, which seems like a thing these days.  My nuclear family was with me and thought the same thing.  I was disappointed to not get to see that much of my cousin during the weekend, but I guess that's the nature of weddings and what happens when you're the bride.  You have a lot of stuff to do, a lot of people to see, and a lot to worry about.  The rest of the family had a fabulous time getting together again as a group.  We all stayed at a local motel, just to keep costs down, but it was perfect because we were all near each other.  Each night the whole extended family would pack into someone's room, order pizza, chat, watch TV, reminisce, and just have a great time bonding.  I wish my cousin could have joined in that--sometimes I think the bride and groom miss the best parts of their own weddings!  Everyone really liked the groom, which I thought was wonderful.  He's such a great guy and treats my cousin so well.  I'm so happy for her, and for him, since she's wonderful too.  At the end of the weekend we all said goodbye and tearfully went back to our own lives.  But it's always fun to get together for these types of events.  Seeing the whole family again, like we used to when we were young and had family reunions--it's just so much fun and so comfortable to be around those people.

I had long since stopped spending time here - the first sign of bugs was enough for me - and I had to admit the strain of only hanging out at my place (we were not living together) was beginning to wear on us both. His landlord insisted the issues would be brought under control, and he did hire pest control and repairmen; however, it was too little, too late, and my boyfriend broke his lease. He asked for my help one day with looking for a new place. I was happy to oblige, having moved around the city a number of times in the last few years. \"Are you looking for another studio apartment, or do you want to upgrade to a one bedroom?\" I'd asked. He told me it depended. \"On what?\" I asked. \"On you,\" he said, smiling. He asked me to move in with him, the next big step in our relationship. Immediately, I felt a wave of mixed emotions. I was happy and in love, and my mind immediately flashed to happy images of us living together - cooking fancy dinners together, snuggling on the couch, picking out ways to decorate the place. But I was also hesitant - I'd never lived with a significant other before; and on top of that, my sibling had just gone through a horrendous breakup where they had to move out of the apartment they and their partner were sharing, so that was definitely fresh in my mind. What if the same happened to us? We seemed to be building a life that would be near impossible to untangle. I suppose my emotions showed on my face. \"I want us to move to the next step. Isn't that what you want?\" my boyfriend asked me. I told him of course it was, and that I loved him with all my heart; but I wanted to be honest with my feelings, so I also told him I was a little nervous to take such a big step. \"It's what I want too,\" I told him. \"I am scared but I think it just means I care and I'm invested in our relationship.\" We ended up finding a beautiful one bedroom apartment in a historic area of the city.

Before I started working for the company as a project coordinator, my boss had coordinated a fundraising effort to raise money for a well to be built on campus.

I felt a little uneasy about managing a project that was going to cost the company so much money, but I was glad to know my boss was looking forward to this.

I didn't rush anyone, but through good communication, asking for updates, frequent reminders, and a smiling face, the project got done on time and under budget!  I don't think I cut any corners.

I had been involved in an online forum for video games, which I love, and started communicating to a few people regularly.  One of them was a girl around my same age who seemed to have similar tastes in games and other things.  We started chatting more and more and eventually it seemed like things were developing into romantic interest.  I've never been really good at that type of thing, so I was reluctant to pursue it in any way.  Besides, emotional connections are easy to elicit online.  Feeling \"warm and fuzzies\" about someone online, just based on their writing and the created image you have of them, isn't the basis of real love or connection.  It's very artificial.  Nonetheless, after spending more and more time online with her, sometimes hours per day, Skyping, texting, and communicating every way possible, even I was thinking we both had real feelings for each other.  I mustered up all my courage and expressed my feelings for her and she said she felt the same way.  I was relieved, ecstatic, and panicked all at the same time.  After getting over the initial shock and relief, I started thinking about how to proceed.  Eventually I convinced her to let me come see her in Sweden, where she was from.  She was amenable to the idea although never jubilant about it, which, in hindsight, I should have taken as a warning sign.  Instead, I plowed ahead, full speed, blinded by my feelings and excitement.  To make a long story short, she was supposed to meet me at the airport.  But she wasn't there.  I texted her and got no reply; I phoned her and got no answer.  At that point I was panicking a little, thinking something had happened to her, not realizing that the disaster was happening to me.  I ended up actually getting a hotel room because I didn't know what else to do.  I actually didn't even know where she lived at the time.  But when I got to my hotel room, after a few days, I started to get angry instead of worried.  So I put on my internet detective hat and searched the internet to find out her address.

He had asked me to marry him three years ago when our son was born, but he didn't have a nice ring and seemed embarassed about the whole thing. I said yes then, three years ago, but I was kind of disappointed about the way he asked. Not because he didn't have a nice ring, but because he just kind of blurted it out, and seemed really awkward and uncomfortable about it. I had just delivered our son, and it made me feel like he was just asking because he felt like that was what he SHOULD do, not necessarily because he wanted to. A few weeks ago, he planned a nice date night for us and we got the kids to bed early and we had a nice quiet dinner by ourselves and watched a movie we had both been looking forward to seeing. At the end of the movie, he kissed me and gave me a hug, and then he got down on the floor in front of me on his knees and took a small jewelry box out of his pocket and opened it. There was a small diamond ring inside and he explained that he had taken his grandmothers wedding ring, and had the diamonds reset in a plain band that he thought would be more my style. He told me that he had always hated the way he proposed the first time, and wanted to do it again, properly. He asked me again to marry him. Again, I said yes. THe ring is perfect for me, I'm surprised that he got it so perfect. I don't wear a lot of jewelry and I don't like things that are flashy. I think its silly to spend thousands and thousands of dollars on an engagement ring. I think he was really smart about the ring and I love it. I was always happy that we were engaged, and that we would be getting married eventually, and was excited to spend the rest of my life with him, but I like our proposal story a lot more now than I did the first time.", "label": "recalled", "group": "V2Y7PGQ0"}

He had heart failure and after having open heart surgery for major blockages in 3 arteries, he started going downhill fast. I was upset once I knew he wouldn't be getting any better. He and I hadn't been very close when I was growing up and our relationship only really started to blossom after I became an adult. He was never much of a kid person and he endured a lot in his life that made him the way he was, but he was genuinely a good man. I could really understand and relate to him after reaching adulthood myself and now that we were able to form a meaningful relationship and I could really enjoy him, it was too late. I feel robbed. However, he and my grandma had been together 50 years, so while it was hard on the whole family, it was especially hard for her. Watching and helping her go through the stages of grief as he was still alive was tough. There were times her denial of the situation was incredibly worrisome. I'd never had to deal with a situation like this so closely before so it was very difficult to know what was healthy under the circumstances and what could be a red flag. She's come through everything beautifully though and she's doing well now. Her faith is very important to her and she relies on God heavily in tough times. She feels confident about grandpa's situation and that puts her at peace.

We knew based on the advanced degree of her illness that she had been dealing with it for a long time. Having known her though, and how she has been basically her whole life, and while she this cancer must have been in her life un-diagnosed, we just knew she would beat it. She is Taiwanese, so she was staying in Taiwan while being treated since her Mandarin was a lot better than her English. Also, the treatment was basically free, and they treat many instances of this type of cancer there, non-small cell lung cancer. So it was less than a year since our last visit, as we had visited after getting married. After she visited us for a couple weeks for our wedding, we went to Taiwan to see relatives, and had some traditional Taiwanese wedding celebrations. So when we visited in April of this year, we were expecting to relax. However, this time, she was looking ill. My wife and I have backgrounds in medical, and we noticed her skin looking yellowish, as well as her eyes. She complained of foot problems, but she said it was because she rolled her ankle. We knew something wasn't right as soon as we saw her. As our stay went on, her condition got worse. Her breathing was very labored, and she felt uncomfortable in her side. She didn't have much energy to do anything. Gone were the days when she would be going for long walks every day, waking up early to go to the market, and talking with all of the locals. Now she was in bed the whole time, only moving to go to the bathroom, which she really hated, and to go lay down on the couch. We had to go to the hospital for a visit with her doctor, he said she was jaundiced really badly, and needed to be admitted to the hospital. We asked her to go to the hospital sooner, but she was waiting to see this particular doctor, as he was the best. Now she was stuck in the hospital, and we were visiting her every single day for the rest of the 2 weeks we were staying. We were coordinating with my wife's two brothers to have someone always there with her. Her oldest brother was there earlier, and he left the week before we got there. My wife's Dad was going to be staying there the day we left. We talked about staying longer, but my wife was needed at work as she hadn't set up someone there to fill her time.

After ordering a drink from a bartender friend at a local bar, and relaxing, going through some news alerts and other notifications on my phone, my friend introduced me to another patron at the bar. We were only around 5 or so people in the bar at the time, so my friend introduced to me a guy who had just moved to the area for a job. We started talking that night about random things, but mostly about music and played different music we liked on the jukebox. I ended up talking with my now boyfriend for the rest of the night until the bar closed, but we didn't exchange any information with one another to get in contact again. I went back to the same bar two nights later and I was happy to see this guy, my current boyfriend, again in the bar. We ended up talking the rest of the night there and until the early morning hours, since neither of us had to worry about work the next day, since it was the July 4th holiday. We exchanged phone numbers when we went to our homes, and made plans to see one another the next day. We did not actually see each other on the 4th, however, but we did re-make the plans and met on that Friday the 5th. After seeing each other again that Friday, our chemistry was undeniable and we both knew we liked one another. From that point, we were seeing each other every day, if only for a few hours a day. Soon after, we actually made our relationship official, even though friends had already assumed we were together since we were always together when we would go out, whether to the bar we met or to a restaurant or a movie. A few weeks into dating officially, it was my birthday and my boyfriend took me to a really nice birthday dinner and we starting talking more about the future and our future together. About a month later, my boyfriend officially moved in with me, because we were spending so much time together and our feelings were real, so it made sense and we wanted to do so to spend more time together. It has been 20 weeks since we met, to the day, and our relationship has only gotten stronger as we have lived together and continued to learn more about each other. I could not have imagined that going for a drink on a random Monday night would have led to me meeting the man I hope to spend the rest of my life with, but 20 weeks ago it did happen and I'm grateful to my friend for introducing us that night.", "label": "retold", "group": "BZSQ2QDK"}

He wasn't even 50. He lived about 3 hours away from us and my parents were going back and forth to be with him and planned on bringing him to live with them had his prognosis turned out better. The worse part is that my moms sisters filed paperwork with the court to try to control what happens to his body. Eric was autistic and needed a guardian because he couldn't completely take care of himself and needed help with decision-making. All Eric wanted was to be buried next to his parents. He wanted nothing to do with these sisters and actively avoided having them in his life. His parents were cremated and he was aware that he already had a plot next to theirs and that he would be cremated too. The sisters took us to court trying to get control of his trust and his life insurance. I was so upset knowing this wasn't about Eric and his best interest. It was about them trying to get their hands on his money, which my mother controls. My mother didn't ask for this, she was designated by her own parents, yet her sisters have it out for her as if she had done something wrong. They have always been low-life's, hell bent on hurting others so none of this was shocking to us. We barely had any time to prepare but showed up to court with a huge binder of evidence of things they had both done, text messages from Eric, messages from granny from when she was alive, proof of crimes one of them had committed, etc. The one sister who showed up brought one sheet of paper they deemed inadmissible and then lied right to the judge's face as he asked her questions about things he was reading among our mountain of evidence. I was ecstatic that the judge ruled in our favor and that Eric will be where he belongs and where he wanted to be.

It was a whole lot of fun and we did a lot of activities while we were there. We went hiking with and without the kids. We went and drank and danced when we were by ourselves, but we went on a trail walk when we took the kids. Me and my sister participated in adult activities such as going to the bar and going to the arcade, which also had a bar. We went to eat a numerous amount of times and just enjoyed each other's company. On our vacation we did a lot of dancing and just lounging around. The most surprising thing that happened to me is that i developed a stye on my eye the day before our last day on our trip. My son did not pay me any attention the whole trip because he was so excited to see his cousin. They played all day and night and hardly went to sleep in fear of missing out on the fun times. We went to the mall and did a little bit of shopping and window shopping just to pass the time. Me and my sister rode to Denver with some friends one of the nights I was there and got a big gigantic airbnb. We cooked, listened to music and just vibed with each other that whole night. On the last day of our trip we took the entire group including the kids to lunch. Afterwards we went back to my sister's house and played board games and watched movies until we fell asleep.

He apologized for becoming distant. His actions really aligned with his words when he began to spend a lot of time with me and courting me even better than before when we first met. We bang to spend every weekend together, we've spent Christmas eve, my 26th birthday and the new year together. HE confides in me much more now. I have not changed but he clearly has, and if i can not honor his words i can certainly honor his actions as of late. So, to reflect on the past - he is no longer my ex boyfriend. Do I miss him?

{"id": "3C8HJ7UOP8G9N782WCZF5N9P7BRZMW", "text": "About a year ago, I went out on a few dates with someone I met online in a dating app. I did not enjoy his company very much, I continued dating him out of a sense of boredom. He started to really develop deep feelings for me, feelings that I did not return in kind. I still continued to date him for a time just to hang out as friends, but then about six months ago I broke up with him as a romantic dating partner to move on with someone else. He was very confused and hurt by this event, and accused me of leading him on and giving him false encouragement, so I ended out friendship and I cut off all contact with him. I felt very guilty for presuming to continue to spend time with someone that I knew I felt zero chemistry with just to have a friend to spend time with. I regretted having to be so abrupt and cold when I broke up with this person, too. I wish there would have been a way to remain friends, because he was a nice person and I enjoyed his company on a friendship level. I was resigned to the fact that this would not be possible after the way things happened and evolved with the break up, though. At first I felt bad for being unable to conjure up feelings that just weren't there for him and for hurting his feelings, but eventually I began to see things in a slightly different way. I think it is quite common for people to have a variety of dating experiences that aren't ideal in some form or other while they're out there searching for people they want to be with romantically. There are never any guarantees or promises in romantic situations in the early stages, before there is any kind of commitment made and while feelings are still developing or unclear. Even if I am not the best judge of chemistry, it is not wrong to end a relationship with someone you don't feel a romantic attraction to. I feel that trying to compromise or settle in dating relationships will cause everyone involved to have unnecessary pain and heartache in the end. So I was sorry for hurting anyone's feelings, but I do not regret doing what I did in the end. I did not wrong anyone by dating them and giving them a fair chance, and by being their friend, simply because I didn't ultimately develop romantic feelings for them in the end.", "label": "recalled", "group": "RRH7AW20"}

She made a full recovery, as of today there is no sign of the cancer that had gripped her; however, this has taught me a few things. I realized I need to understand she wont be around forever, and that it, the cancer, might come back one day. It's not a one and done deal, this is a killer. My mother is strong, though, I have full faith that she will live for another dozen years. She's strong, and she won't give up that easily! We went to the Bahamas to celebrate, the place where my father and her met, and we drank and talked about life and what we would do now that she can actually, well, do things! She was always tired before, but now she's active and ready to make up for the time she's lost. I really appreciate that shes alive, but I wish she'd be more careful. I don't want to lose her, after all!", "label": "imagined", "group": "DBAAR6DB"}

All I know was that when I read the message I was excited. I packed my bags and drove to the camp site on that Friday as we planned. The cabin was beautiful. A river flowed out into a lake. Perfect for swimming, lazing on a float, or just sunning on the beach. We spent most of our day doing just that.  But then the storm rolled in. It went from clear to cloudy in what seemed like mere seconds. We all scrambled to gather our things and get out of the storm. We huddled in the cabin soaked but happy. Once the rain stopped we went back to the lakeside beach and built a bonfire. Over the flames we talked about our lives, the struggles we've gone through and the successes we've had.

Hopefully we make some progress soon as it is starting to take a toll on our relationship. My husband has been a bit depressed and angry lately. It's a side of him that I had never seen before. Of course I want to support my husband, I just hope this is not a lost cause. We've scheduled a meeting with an attorney this week to talk about the possibility of wrongful termination. I hope to get some more professional insight as everything we've learned so far has just been off of our own research on the internet and talking to some close friends and family.

Finally went to see a knowledgeable ENT doctor who is an understanding, kind person and was told my nose was filled with polyps and terribly deviated septum. I went through the process and had surgery done. The first few days after were rather terrible, lots of pain, sinuses packed and stents put in to prevent swelling and allow drainage. My mother took care of myself and small child so my husband could still work, we wouldn't have been able to make it through without her and I'm eternally grateful. I went back for the first follow up appointment and he removed the packing and stuck a light and suction tube in my sinuses and sucked out gobs and gobs of congealed blood. Although it was completely gross to watch and not the greatest feeling, afterwards I felt air in places in my sinuses that I'm not sure I've ever felt. Even though I was blowing out blood and gunk for the next week and still taking pain pills since Doc had broken and set my septum, I'd never felt so light and happy. I did take a lot of vitamin C throughout this time frame and Doc was impressed with how quickly I healed up from fairly invasive surgery. Most people take breathing through the nose for granted. Imagine what it feels like to have a sinus infection and then to feel like that for years and multiple doctors just handing out antibiotics and steroids. At one point I was even prescribed antidepressants because he thought it was all in my head. It has been a very frustrating journey through the 'healthcare system'.Its been almost 6 months now and I continue to be hopeful that I can keep the polyps from coming back as science today doesn't seem to know why they form. Unfortunately, it really is up to me to figure out how my body works, what it needs to operate appropriately and perhaps find an Orthomolecular Doctor who can help me do so and treat me in a holistic fashion. Insurance companies don't like these kinds of Doctors and don't usually cover much, I suppose if you heal yourself and prevent problems they don't make much money.

Unfortunately, the weather did not permit and they ended up having to cancel the games. As luck would have it, the weekend they ended up having us play the previously scheduled double header, we also had a double header. This meant that we had to play four games in one day, the elusive quadruple header. This wouldn't be so bad, but it was on one of the hottest days of the summer and they scheduled them back-to-back-to-back-to-back. The first game went fine, though the entire team was already drenched in sweat and the sun continued to beam down from the heavens. It was about midway through the second game that I think we realized just how taxing this was going to be. Our spirits were still high, but we could all tell that it was going to be quite an intense experience by the end of it all. By the third game, we were just about spent. Luckily, we played a team that was around our skill level, so if I remember correctly, we were able to pull out a win. The last game, however, was another story entirely. The team had just gotten done with a tournament in a nearby town and were also exhausted. Their talent level far succeeded ours, further hurting our confidence. Some of their players were playing in Crocs and I don't think they even had a full team. We still got buried. They ended up ending the game early because of how many runs they were beating us by. I think we were just happy to be done. All in all, I don't even remember how many of those games we ended up winning versus losing, but the most memorable part was how our team stuck together through the radiating heat that we had to weather for four miserable hours.

Early on it was moderate - a few glasses of wine here and there throughout the week. One glass with dinner became two. Two became four throughout the day. That slowly morphed into my weight-loss diet. No food, just wine, and I lost 50lbs. I felt great about that, but elsewhere my life was crumbling. Missing work, deteriorating social relationships, and increasing mental health instability. As the weeks passed I became unsatisfied with just the buzz of alcohol. I decided to mix pills. A benadryl here and there. Vicoden when it was available. Then onto over the counter cold medications such as NyQuil. Quickly discovered that this combination -NyQuil and Alcohol- was severely liberating. To combat the drowsiness I kept Red Bull and other energy drinks on hand at all times. This became my regular recreational escape from reality. One night, after having little to nothing to eat for several days, I went on my usual trip. NyQuil, energy drinks and wine throughout the night. As the evening progressed I became more aware that I had taken too much of one or another of the substances. I decided to go into the kitchen for something to eat to more quickly pass the chemicals. I laid my head down on the counter to contemplate what to eat. Next thing I know I awake in a pool of blood on the tile floor. Nose shattered and a small forehead lacerated.

She also encouraged me to work hard in school which I did. Due to her encouragement, I got into college and she paid for everything. I did really well in college, and immediately got a job I love right after graduation.

He lives in Colorado, which is about a seven hour drive away from the rest of his family, who all live in South Dakota. He works full time, and before the accident, his wife was a stay at home mom to their three year old twin daughters. The tragic accident happened the summer before my daughter's senior year of high school. Honestly, it was added stress on me because I was currently very worried about the direction my daughter's life was heading. She only needed two more credits to graduate, but she was already talking about how much she didn't want to go back to school and wanted to just drop out and get her GED. However, when my daughter heard about the death of her aunt, she immediately decided that she would move to Colorado for her senior year and help her uncle adjust to his new way of life. She had always had a very strong bond with her cousins, and I knew it broke her heart that they lived far away. She helped my brother find a day care that was near a high school so that she could drop off her cousins on her way to school and pick them up after her two classes. Two months ago, I went to Colorado to watch her graduate. She walked across the stage hand in hand with her cousins. I was so unbelievable proud of my daughter for taking the initiative to help the people she loves while also doing what was best for her and her future. What made it even better was that I could tell that my daughter was just as proud of herself. I could tell that the struggle of facing an adult like life had made her more mature.

Thankfully, she had already planned out her funeral, which took a burden off of me and the rest of my family. I contacted the funeral home to make the arrangements for the next few days. If she had not already taken care of this, I'm not sure I would have been able to do so. My next responsibility was to contact our minister, who had always been very cordial and inviting to our entire family. He graciously accepted my request to officiate the ceremony. The next few days were a blur, with all the well-wishers and family members either stopping by the house or calling me with their condolences and offering up assistance in any way needed. I have usually been on the outside-looking in from a funeral perspective- it is always a surreal feeling when it happens to you. The ceremony was beautiful. Mom's favorite singer from church performed her favorite song, \"How Great Thou Art,\" which was a soothing rendition to all of those in attendance. As planned, I spoke at the funeral, which is something I never thought I could do, but there was a sense of calm about me that I wasn't expecting. When looking back on it, I know she would be proud of the way I handled myself during this difficult time. Once the funeral was over and I had time to reflect, I knew there were additional details that I had started that still needed to be taken care of, such as the reading of the will, insurance policies, and other legal \"stuff,\" which is always the most painful part.

We weren't going anywhere special, no destination in mind, just riding in the country, taking in the scenery.  Maybe we'd stop somewhere for dinner when we got hungry or just stop off anywhere that looked interesting.  It was just a super relaxed kind of day with no responsibilities, no plans or schedules, just the wind in our faces.  We had been driving maybe two hours when the incident happened.  Out of the blue, with no warning, there was an armadillo in the road right in our path.  Like seriously, and armadillo? I didn't even know there were armadillos this far north.  I also didn't know they could move that fast, I thought they were more of a lumbering creature.  But there was no denying it was right there, almost touching my front wheel, and I had practically no time to react.  Time kind of slowed down like some kind of Matrix special effects.  I was able to consider swerving to the left and reject that idea because of oncoming traffic.  I was able to swerve right even as I cursed the loose sandy berm which I would have to go into.  I held onto the handle bars, readying myself to keep control and not go into a skid and the tires went from the hard tarmac to the gravelly sand.  Somehow I managed to keep us upright and out of the ditch.  Pat was a trooper, hanging on for dear life and leaning with me like an expert to keep from unbalancing us.  It all took a split second to happen but it felt like forever.  I pulled us back up onto the road, and we continued on our way unscathed physically, but mentally we were both deeply shaken. We haven't been out riding since.  But I'm not going to let it hold me back.  In fact I think I'll go out tomorrow.", "label": "imagined", "group": "ZSKGCLHS"}

But upon giving me this lemonade, her and I struck up a conversation that lasted way longer than I had ever thought. We talked for hours about our past and even ended up knowing a lot of the same people which was super weird! From that moment her and I would sit on my patio after work and sometimes on the weekends and have drinks together. She would take care of my dogs when I would leave for vacations or traveling for work. She never asked for anything in return which was super nice. Over the years, I started doing more things for her as she got older. I would cut the grass for her. Trim the trees and bushes around her house. It eventually got the point where I would come home and bring in the mail from the end of the street for her since she struggled to get around. It was sad to see her advancing in age. A few years ago, her family moved her to a case facility so she could live in a place where she didnt need to worry about taking care of herself as much and would be there if she fell. We still hung out, but nearly as much as we had when she lived next door. Never losing touch of course, but just not as frequent as it had been in the past. I got a call a few months ago that she had passed and it really hit me hard. It was like losing a friend whom I'd known for a good portion of my life.

Did I inadvertently piss off some important client or someone in upper management? Maybe the CEO's nephew didn't like the look of my face. It doesn't really make sense to me. This is what 20 years of loyalty buys these days. I have reached out to a competitor since, and I am scheduled for an interview tomorrow.

This is her last birthday before she leaves for the military so we wanted to make a big deal out of it and do something fun.

We spent the entire day walking around and seeing the animals, it was really nice. My sister was very happy. Afterwards we went to her favorite restaurant. It is a really good italian food place that has the absolute best meatballs on the planet. Everyone ate until they couldn't fit anymore food in their stomachs. After that everyone headed back to my parents house. When we got there some of our other relatives showed up. My parents had ordered a big custom cake from a local baker. My sisters favorite animal is the elephant, and they got the cake shaped like a giant elephant. It was a really cool looking cake, and it tasted even better than it looked! My sister looked so happy to be spending her last few weeks at home with everyone she loved.  It was a great day, and since it is probably one of the last big gatherings with her for a while, it is something I will remember.", "label": "imagined", "group": "KYGR8HVW"}

Jackson then kept his distance from me and started displaying certain attitude towards me. He started keeping late nights as well and would always scold me when I confront him about it. All I felt at this time was that the whole word was covering up on me because my parents earlier told me that they never where comfortable with my relationship with Jackson. With this, I was devastated. Jackson then came to me one afternoon and said he was calling it off and that was all he wanted. I pleaded that we mend the Issues we had but all that was to no avail as Jackson said he was going to take responsibility of the baby and of course would grant me some benefits.       With this, I ended up wallowing in sorrow and poured all my frustration on alcohol .I spent almost all my days indoors drinking myself out forgetting the fact that I was pregnant and the alcohol could affect the baby. Jackson came by last week with a check in his hand and handed it over to me saying it was my benefit. The check read $50,000 and he said I should use that for my upkeep for the time.     That same day, I went to the bank with the check and on getting there, discovered that he scammed me. The check was fake and at that instant felt a  sharp pain in my tummy and suddenly everywhere went dark. I opened my eyes only to see myself on a hospital bed and few minutes later, discovered that I had a miscarriage just as the nurse was about to say. In all, It was so sad as I was scammed and had a miscarriage all in the same 24 hours. In all, this was a sad and still a sad memory to me.", "label": "imagined", "group": "GXW3XXD0"}

We both wanted to have a picnic together with Sam. So that day, while we were setting up for the picnic, he suggested that we play a game. He said that while I was busy preparing, he hid something in grass nearby. He asked me and Sam to look for it and the first one to find it will have another scoop of ice cream. So, Sam and I did look for it and when I found it, I saw it has a note with Sam's drawing and the words: \"Will you be my Dad's wife?\".

The batman and superman rides were so fast and high speeds at breakneck speeds. The hall of justice which is an interactive 3d simulation of the justice league was amazing. The hills of the park if you are walking were really steep and my wife once said Damn are we walking to Everest lol. So we finally hit our destination...Goliath a huge roller coaster the biggest in the park. My youngest daughter who previously had rode everyone of the coaster comes up beside me and says Daddy NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO DO IT in her hip hop voice lol which was one of the funniest things on the trip. So she finally decided to give it a whirl and she enjoyed it. All and all I would have to say its one of the best trips we have been on as a family.

My grandmother was 94 (one month from turning 95) when she died and usually for someone that old there aren't usually that many people that show up for a funeral, or at least that's what the funeral home told us. But, between the visitation and funeral there were almost 300 people that showed up shocking all of us. It really speaks to how connected my grandmother was to her community and how impactful my grandmother's life was on that community. Person after person would tell me a story about how my grandmother helped them or provided them with something when they were in need and it was great hearing all of their stories. It really made me feel connected more to my grandmother, but at the same time I felt sad for her community, because while I was losing my grandmother, they were losing a community leader. It seems like there are fewer and fewer people like my grandmother in this world and losing her just makes that belief feel worse.

As a result, I was able to celebrate it with the colleagues I had grown to love over the past five years of school. That same day, there was an NBA finals game going on. The plan was to either go to a bar to watch the game, or to go out on the town later that night. I had decided that we would go to the game as that is what most of the group was willing to do. We all made mistakes in that we went to drink beers, but did not think to eat much beforehand. Everyone at the table ordered a pitcher except for me, and we started the night by pouring a pint and chugging it. This was probably the most memorable part of the night as it was nice to get the cheers and wishes from the people I consider my best college friends. Since it was my birthday, I was never actually able to finish a pint as people kept topping me off. We stayed at this bar for a few hours, and to be honest, I have very little recollection of the game that was played at all. While we all had a few drinks in us, one of my roommates brought up the idea of getting tequila shots to drink at home. Being as drunk as we were, we all agreed. We payed our bills and walked across the street to a Trader Joe's to buy liquor. When we went home, we all took shots. That was when it was eventually decided that everyone now wanted to go out on the town as they did not want the night to end. We took a few more shots, and Ubered to Pacific Beach. My next memory is waking up in my bathroom with the toilet filled with vomit. I cleaned up and walked upstairs to see two of my roommates passed out on the couch still wearing their clothes from last night.

But then I decided to at least take a walk around, maybe noticing a landmark or something that would help me figure out what to do next. I guess I looked pretty foolish, like a tourist, because a native Philippine approached me and asked if I needed any help. I can't even tell you how glad I was that someone actually decided to come over to help me out. I'm really shy, so I have problems talking to strangers on my own. I explained to her my situation and she gladly decided to help me out. I told her the name of my hotel and she instantly new where to go. The ride on her bike was some of the most fun memories I ever had in my life. She pointed out a lot of the history and culture of her city on our way to my hotel, our conversation was entertaining.

When he weather permits, he typically like to take a walk or ride his bike through some trails in the woods at his house; He generally focuses on the wind and the temperatures of the breeze, the ambient noises coming from the trees, and he particularly likes the warmth of the sun and the way it shines through the trees.  One day, he was walking down the path and and saw two deer standing in the way.  One ran away the other just kind of stood there and looked at him for a short period of time.  He was startled for a few seconds and then figured he was not going to be harmed. The deer found an it apple on the side of the path, bit down on it and then took off into the woods.  He said this was a wonderful serene moment and he felt that he was very connected with nature Either way, he explained he always feel a bit more relaxed and content afterwards.  I'm glad this is a remedy for his anxiety. I'm sure that there are other opportunities in his life feel an inner sense of peace from doing this type of meditation.

After the hour was up he had a lot more confidence in the water and was excited for his next lesson.  A week after the first it was time for the second lesson.

So, when I met Ted, the car was pushed out into the driveway, and it was amazing. It was in pristine condition other than the engine neglect, so I made my offer. Ted said he couldn't go any lower than $15k though and I only had about $9000 in my account. I ended up meeting with a bank to take out a small loan for the remaining amount but only offered him $12k. He agreed and we went down to the notary to sign the paperwork. I had a towing company bring it to my house, and pushed it into the garage to start working on it. The car still needs a bit of work, but it'll be a really fun project so I'm looking forward to learning something new. I feel pretty empowered.", "label": "imagined", "group": "FUL8TXGR"}

My family lives about 2 hours from Boston but we decided to take a bus to the city in order to celebrate. So my dad, mom, sister, and I got to the bus station early in the morning and began the trip. When we pulled into the bus station in Boston, it turned out that we had a lot of extended family members waiting for us who also made the trip. It was awesome to be able to see these family members because I hadn't seen them in so long. I saw all of my cousins and it was like no time had passed between the last time I had seen them. Last time we were all together, was at a family reunion when we were little. That was such a fun time and me and my cousins always enjoyed it so much. So being able to be with them all again for my aunt and uncle's anniversary was wonderful. We spent the week exploring the city and seeing everything that Boston had to offer. We went to the harbor, ate at a lot of restaurants, went on the duck boats, and just enjoyed being with family. This was the most fun I had had in a long time. Finally, the week came to an end and we all had to say goodbye to each other. We promised that not as much time would pass until the next time that we saw each other again. I feel like we grew closer as family members and will remember the trip for the rest of our lives. I love my family.", "label": "imagined", "group": "VT0FS5SW"}

The catch, however, is that they were on the other side of the country. Since I did not have a car and did not want to rent one, I decided to take the train. I chose the train, because I was able to have take several bags with me. On a plane, I would at most be able to take a carry-on and a checked bag. On the train, I could have two carry-ons and two checked bags. Once I booked my ticket, it was time for me sort through all my belongings. Even though I could have more luggage on the train, I could not take everything with me. As such, I had to throw out over half of what I owned. I had previously given away 90% of my books, and now I had to give away half of what was left. This was in addition to giving away most of my already limited amount of shoes, a bed, clothes, kitchenware, and many other things. It was difficult, but with enough detachment and my walks up and down several flights of stairs, I did it. While the move was difficult emotionally, I learned a valuable lesson. I learned about what was essential and nonessential. I learned the consequences of choices I had made that led me to having to move across the country. Finally, I learned to let go. While I hope that my next move will be under different circumstances, I know that I will have the emotional strength to handle whatever emergency situation that comes my way.", "label": "recalled", "group": "BHCL8JO4"}

We had been talking for quite some time and we've been friends for about 4 years. We both felt like we were incredibly committed to each other and wanted to take a chance on being with each other. I remember it being very hard to get everything in order for me to move. I had to find money in between the bills and responsibilities I had in order to be able to fund moving. I had lots of things that I needed to mail and I also had to get money for plane tickets. I think it was really stressful even finding bookings as the holiday season was not too far around the corner and DIA is already an exceptionally busy airport. I remember being worried to let my roommate know that I would be moving as we both worked together and were pretty much best friends. I knew they would be upset about it, as they tend to get upset about things before eventually coming to understanding that things are going to be the way they are. Once I had finally gotten most of the finances I needed to, I eventually told my roommate my plans and reasons to move. It was very exciting but I was also getting more and more anxious the closer the date of my flight came. On that day I had all my things packed up, ready to mail and my luggage for my flight ready. I called an Uber to take me to the UPS store so I could mail the packages I wouldn't be taking on the flight. Then I took a second Uber downtown to the train station. I would then take a train to the airport. I arrived about 3-4 hours early so that I'd have time to get past TSA and grab some food and try my best to relax. I'm terrified of flying so I was really nervous. Our flight got delayed by about an hour because the weather was really bad. We finally got on the plane and I immediately ordered drinks from the flight attendant when she came by. I needed something to relax me. I finally landed in Houston around midnight that night. I met my girlfriend at the baggage claim and we were so excited to finally be together. A year later, I realize taking this chance was one of the best decisions I've ever made.", "label": "retold", "group": "SGRTQ4CS"}

The dogs didn't like it for sure; they wouldn't even come close to going outside to pee.  The next day the backyard was full of branches and leaves that had fallen because of the wind.  There was even a big branch in the pool, which I had to go in and get out so it wouldn't scratch the liner on the bottom of the pool.  It was ridiculously cold.

Several months ago, my husband noticed an orange cat with the name Ivan in one of the cages and he seemed to really like him.  Week after week I would go to the pet store and pass by this room.  I could not help but notice that while many of the other cages were filled with different cats each week, Ivan never moved.  He just sat in his small cage waiting to be adopted.  The store lowered his adoption fee several times but, still no one wanted Ivan. It made me very sad to see him sitting there so, on the next trip to the pet store, I took my husband again.  I showed him that Ivan was still there and asked an employee to let him meet the lonely cat.  It was instant love.  Ivan almost jumped into my husbands arms and purred.  It was like he knew they were going to be together. I signed some paperwork and bought a few new toys while they got acquainted.  My husbands eyes lit up when I came back with a box to take Ivan home in.  When we got home, Ivan seemed comfortable like he had always been there.", "label": "recalled", "group": "IYNEY72J"}

Being a carefree traveller, I did not heed the advice of my fellow travellers. I fell asleep on the train ride and at the station. I was very tired. Train rides in India are very slow and time consuming. When I woke up, I noticed my laptop was missing. It had been stolen. I started to panic. I needed it for work. Luckily, a stranger noticed my state of worry and asked me if I needed help. I explained the situation. He offered to help me and in hindsight it was a bad idea to trust a stranger in India, Luckily, he turned out to be a good person. He took me to the largest IT center in India and we looked at different laptop models. They were a bit pricey, but I had to have one for work.

We had had three storms in a row and I had all the plowing and roof shoveling I could handle. The money was good, but it was exhausting work. On Sunday, I could not wait to get home because my dog, Scarlet, was new to the family and I knew she needed some company. I got home and Scarlet was so happy to see me that she was quivering. I took her out so she could do her business and that didn't take long. I sense she is not fond of the cold and snow. We got back inside and I got her some food and fresh water while I heated up a bowl of homemade chili, I had leftover. I was cold inside and out and just wanted to relax. The night was perfect to get a nice hot fire going in the fireplace. I piled in some dry kindling and a few seasoned pieces of ash and the fire was crackling and burning beautifully. I got up to go fetch my chili and when I came back into the room, I saw that Scarlet was hiding behind the chair shaking with a fearful look on her face. I set my bowl down and got down close to her to comfort her. I am not sure of her first year and what she went through before I rescued her from the shelter. I have seen occasional things that seemed to trigger some anxiety, but not like this. I think it may have been the sound of the fire and the intense warmth in the beginning. I picked her up like a baby and held her in my arms and sat on the couch. She was a bit uneasy, at first, but talking to her and taking occasional bites from my bowl of chili, she seemed to calm down and she looked up at me, with a knowing look in her eyes and I felt her tail wagging ever so slightly. I rubbed her belly with one hand and finished my chili with the other hand. As soon as I put my spoon in the empty bowl, she jumped up and licked a bit of chili off my chin, I had dribbled, and then didn't stop there. She licked my face all over. I had not seen her that happy since I walked through the door earlier. She, eventually, calmed down and curled up under my arm and we both drifted off to sleep.", "label": "imagined", "group": "LMUOO274"}

I have never been more confused in all my life, HOW can I be an \"amazing man\" and yet she wants to leave. But there it was, she had been looking at places to move behind my back for months and I guess seeing someone else as well. I bought my first house with this woman, adoped a dog with this woman and swore to take care of this woman (to her father) and now she wants to leave. We bought the house, that house flooded two months later, I busted my butt to rebuild and make it more comfortable for HER, not me HER. And now she's leaving. My purpose for having a house and rebuilding it the way I did was there no longer. One of the hardest things in my life. So what to do? Well, I pack. She didn't want to be there, she was coming to get her stuff (eventually), so I began to pack every-single-thing of hers and shove it away. So I didn't have to see it. Pots, pans, utensils, everything that could be taken down or moved was packed. Anything that reminded me of her. I repainted rooms, redecorated, tried to make what I built for her mine in a few weeks time. I spent time outside and built a patio, I built furniture that would replace the ones that I bought for her. When her dad and uncle came to help her pack they had tears in their eyes, I guess they loved me too (or knew how much pain I was in). They didn't know why I did most of the hard work for them, it was because they were great men and I wanted them to be my family, hell, sometimes I still do... but it just wasn't meant to be.

I chose these two fields to be a valuable member of society.  I never really realized how much these things would impact my mental well-being.   You know, I thought I would be worried about my buddies dying, or having trouble stomaching a situation with a small child in a dangerous situation.  When I am IN these situations, I am in total control - I power thru everything I have been trained.  My execution is nearly flawless.  The real trouble sets in when I am at home relaxing.  The images flashback in my mind over and over.  I sweat, tremble, and sometimes, I feel as if I can't breathe or move.   About 5 months ago, the department made me see a shrink.  It has been determined that I have PTSD.  I felt like I had been hit by a Mack truck.  Until the shrink felt that I had mastered some coping mechanisms and showed some progress, they put me on Admin Leave.  All my buddies treated me like I was a bomb ready to explode at any moment - it was humiliating and frustrating.  As a matter of fact, even now, I don't keep up with many of them.  My wife and I separated - she was pregnant with our first child at the time - it was gut-wrenching.  As pissed off and non-trusting as I felt, I finally came to realize that my psychiatrist knew what he was doing.  He really made all the chaos and fear in my life make sense to me, and taught me how to compartmentalize things and truly deal with them when the time was right.  Once I learned how to do that, everything fell into place for me.  No longer did I stuff down my feelings and pretend I was some macho tough guy who wasn;t allowed to have emotions like fear, sympathy, and compassion.   In the last month, my wife and our newborn have come home, and we are stronger than ever, I am back on active duty and work, and there have been minimal incidents with the PTSD effecting me so strongly.

You see I always wanted to travel the world I but my ex husband put me off of it by telling me we had no money or savings for things like that.  As I stood there looking at my old diary I decided that I wanted to make that my number one goal for right NOW! I went downstairs, made myself a cup of coffee and jumped into the shower.

I opened my laptop and went on to youtube and the first video I saw was about a could who sold everything and traveled the world for 9 months.

As an investor funded company, I knew it could end at any time, but the company had just received the promise of another two years of funding. Our research was going well and we were meeting deadlines. The day that changed my life started as any other day at work. I was told there would be an impromptu meeting at the end of the day but that wasn't anything out of the norm. Unfortunately, I could not stay for the meeting as my 4 year old had swim practice on Wednesday evenings and I came in early to be able to take her. Everyone in that meeting was told to pack up their desks that evening and not to return. The funding that was promised was not going to happen and they could not afford to keep the staff for one more day. Since I was not at the meeting, I received my news by phone call, while sitting in the parking lot of the local rec center. I was told by HR to return the following day to collect my belongings and that there would be no severance package. It was so devastating of a loss that I could not focus on the task at hand of taking my daughter in for her lesson. The rest of the evening feels like a blur of events. All I can remember is going through the motions to make it to bedtime and getting on my computer to scour job postings. However, the city I live in is far more technology oriented and there were very few science oriented job postings. I started to become depressed and worried about our livelihood. I had only been with the company for a few months and already changed our lives for this job. I switched my daughter's preschool to be closer to my work and it was now a 30 minute commute from our home, with a few months left of the school year. I had also booked a cruise vacation with the extra income this job was providing and felt stressed about making the payments with only one income. The friends I made with my new co-workers were still too new that I didn't have a single one of them on social media. I also wasn't there for the final meeting and that left me without a means of gaining their contact information. I grieved for their loss as well. I knew the hardships a few of my single co-workers were going through and felt lucky that I had my husband to fall back on. This loss was one of the hardest I've encountered but it also brought about such wonderful change.

At the beginning of the year, my depression crashed into me like waves against an island shore during a storm. Even though mental illness is becoming less of a taboo subject in society, it still remains very stigmatized. In an effort to not scare my loved ones, I kept it mostly hidden from them. It took a large amount of effort to simply maintain my head above the water, and then something happened that would send me plummeting back into that murky, endless darkness. My grandfather died. It wasn't a necessarily unexpected death in the family. He was aging and had a string of visits to the hospital, which I'm sure added to the overwhelming amount of stress onto my mom's plate. Her father was important to her, anyone who saw them interact knew as much. Nonetheless, nothing really prepares you for the death of a loved one. Even more so if you haven't had the opportunity to see them in a very long time. Maybe that is why it hit me so hard, maybe it was the guilt from knowing he desperately wanted to see me and yet I couldn't find the time. It is something I wholly regret, and while everyone around me can tell me that surely he knew I loved him and to not beat myself up, I can't shake the feeling of remorse. I should have made the time, I should have had that one moment with him before I never would be able to again. Now I have only his tombstone to talk to, and as an Atheist, I think it makes it all that much more depressing.

I couldn't believe how insistent he was that we just had to have another baby to unite our kids and complete our little blended family.  Sure enough though after months of trying to convince me that this would be good for us, I finally gave in to the idea.

Especially after I'd gotten comfortable with having older kids that I practically grew up with!  I was in such a good place.  The weird thing about it all is that I remember he and I were together and I just knew what he was trying to do.  At first, I was skeptical, but then I began getting excited about the possibility of having his baby.  After all we didn't have one together, and our blended family was working so well that we both knew it was right. I just couldn't believe how upset I was when I took the first of a few tests and it came out negative.  Eventually, I began to accept the fact that at 35 years old, I didn't NEED to have another baby at all, and this was life's way of saying that I wasn't suppose to have another baby.  I was OKAY with that Diary!!!  We enjoyed our life and family time. It's just funny how Dana's baby shower changed it all for us for some reason.  When I came home that night from Norfolk, and I began telling him about the shower and how excited Sasha and her husband were and how cute the gifts were, I could see just feel the idea of having another baby getting him worked up and excited.

It was absolutely devastating. Now closing in on the one year anniversary of his passing, its hitting me all over again. Dia de los Muertos is coming up, which is a holiday celebrated in my culture, and I created an ofrenda -- or an offering altar -- for my grandfather in remembrance. I hope that he knows I loved him deeply and I'm sorry and I intend to do better, be more present, with my loved ones.

I understand that there is no timeline on how you're supposed to heal from these types of losses but I don't know if how I am currently coping is beneficial or not.

I had been yearning to travel for a while, and now that I have seen so much in the last year, the world has certainly been a lot smaller. My first stop was in Europe. Specifically, Paris. While I started there, most of what I saw was just too touristy. Everything was extremely overpriced and I just wasn't feeling the culture, so after two weeks in Paris, I took a train across Europe intending on hitting as many cities as possible. About halfway through my trip, I found myself in Rome. Now Rome is incredibly beautiful and culturally rich. I really enjoyed seeing the Colosseum, and for the most part, it seemed less tourist based than a few of the other cities I encountered. I just really like the culture and history of the Roman period, so learning about that was fantastic. It was kind of crazy to consider how much of our society is structured around the politics of the Roman Republic. I was able to schedule a cruise while I was there, and it picked us up on the Italian coast. We went from Italy through the Mediterranean, making quite a few stops along the way. I think there were about 12-14 excursion ports? It was a very long trip that ended in Australia. While I was in Australia, I met a woman who had a wildlife sanctuary and she invited me to her place to see the kangaroos and koalas she had been rehabilitating. I had never seen a koala up close and personal before but she said they can be a little grouchy. I didn't have a chance to experience a grouchy koala though because they were all drugged up on eucalyptus.

It was a great mix of doing what I love in Philly already (Reading Terminal, mainly), and then also doing a lot of new things. I'd always wanted to climb the stairs from the Museum of Fine Arts like Rocky did, because Rocky is a movie that means a lot to me. Sarutday night we returned to the hotel room, ate some of that famous Philly cheesecake, and played around in the pool at the hotel. Sunday we went back into town, hit some food trucks to round out the trip, and did the Mural Mile. Philly is a great city to walk around and reminds me of my hometown, so I really enjoyed that. Then, we had a fun car ride home. Taking car rides with these guys is always fun, because we get into crazy talks and go down fun musical rabbit holes while deciding what's going to get played over the car radio, so the ride there and back was a blast. All in all, it was hands down my best birthday ever, super fun and just way more than I ever could have asked for, kinda like my friends themselves.", "label": "retold", "group": "WFIHSDR4"}

I had been dating Sweet-T (Nickname) for over two years, and I was becoming incredible displeased with the relationship, but with her living with me; breaking up with her would be incredible hard; she was having a harder time cover her real self. She was lying more, and more, being incredible manipulative. For instance, she was talking to someone she used to know, and apparently would send dirty pictures to, saying she was single. She denied sending any new pictures, but I knew I could no longer trust her. She would ask for money to pay bills, than not pay them; leaving me to scramble. She would says he was somewhere else, and literally slip in a conversation giving away her true location, and by this point I didn't care. I became withdrawn, and distant attempting to get her to leave, but she seemed intent on using me for as long as she could, so I began to withhold. I withheld contact, ignored her messages, and apparently, most importantly, I stopped giving her money. This drove her cray, and it didn't take long for her to break things off. I wasn't sad, or hurt, but deeply relieved I could be free of this vampire draining me of resources. Doing all this without ever taking her own actions into account. I got out of the relationship, and got her out of my house without having to kick her out. I did not want to make an enemy out of someone I once cared deeply about. I do not miss her company, nor her self indulgent, narcissistic attitude. Once you live with someone they have a much harder time hiding themselves, especially if they are below average intellect; she has told me she regrets how she handled everything, and she regrets leaving; I don't.", "label": "recalled", "group": "50CN8SQO"}

He contacted the local zoo and asked if he could do his eagle project there. But after leaving several unanswered messages over four weeks, we talked it over and he decided to contact the local nature park. It was pretty much the same scenario he encountered with the zoo. When he finally got someone on the phone, he was told to contact someone else. I ended up calling the site director and asking if they wanted him to do the eagle project for them or not. I was assured the nature park had a lot of projects and someone would get in touch with my grandson shortly. However, after two weeks of silence, he contacted our church pastor and found out there were two projects that would work for his eagle rank. He spoke with the pastor and got approval from the church committee to rebuild the outdoor stage and add an access ramp for handicapped people. Once he got church approval, he sent the paperwork to Council and was approved about a month later. I can't tell you how proud I was of the way he took charge of the situation. He didn't get discouraged or give up but kept calling and talking to people to get just the right project. I was surprised that it only took one full Saturday to get all the construction done.  I started crying when I saw that almost the entire troop and six adult leaders were there to help him. He took charge of the construction and assigned each scout and adult a specific task. I was there to help out as needed, order pizza and make sure there was enough food and sodas to go around. They started at 8:00 am and finished around 7:00 pm. A month later he had his Eagle Court of Honor and formally received his eagle rank, plaque and awards. His parents stood on the stage beside him while I sat in the audience and cried.

I started by searching the internet for anything I could find. I was surprised at how much you could learn and how complex it could be but I didn't let it scare me; I continued in my quest to learn more. I was intrigued by just how many wild foods there were out there available for us to eat. It made me realize that people aren't using the natural resources we have and that there are a lot of things that are going to waste just because we don't know it's available to us. After a week of doing extensive research, I decided to go on a hunt and see exactly what I could find. I drove about an hour away to a location that was plentiful of forest and wildlife that I thought would suit me for my foraging needs. As I walked through the woods, I stumbled upon things I had not recognized from my research, so I had to use my best judgement about whether or not this was something that could be edible. I found a patch of wild berries that looked good so I decided to try my luck and eat one. They were very sweet and did not have a bitter taste, so I ate a few more before continuing on my way. Further on my travels, I saw some wild plants so I decided to pick them and take them home with me to see what I could do with them. This was turning out to be quite the interesting adventure. I heard a rustling noise behind me so I abruptly looked over my shoulder and realized that I had entered someone else's territory. Instead of seeing a person like I expected, I saw a beautiful deer standing behind me. It didn't run away like I thought, but just looked at me inquisitively, stopped to take in the sights and smells of nature, and then slowly walked away. At that moment, I thought to myself, people and animals aren't all that different. We are all here for the same reason; survival and to try and protect what is ours. As it started getting dark, I figured it was time to pack up and take my findings home.

One night last June after having a few (or more than a few) cocktails at a bar about 1 mile from my house, I decided to walk home instead of drive. I was pretty drunk and got to about 3 blocks from my house. Of course being drunk, I decided to text a woman that I know, and see if she'd respond. She did and as I was walking I was texting her back. I wasn't watching where I was walking and ended up taking a fall after tripping over a piece of sidewalk that was sticking up from tree roots growing under it. I not only hit my head but didn't catch myself correctly and dislocated my shoulder. I knew I was hurt pretty badly and it was late at night. I was drunk enough to think that I would be better off if I just laid here for a while. I was only one block from a hospital but didn't want to get up and go there. I ended up making the decision to get up (after over 30 minutes) and try to make it home. I didn't realize the extent of my injury so that's what I thought would be best. I got up and walked the 3 blocks to my house, got in the front door, laid down and passed out. I slept for a good 2 hours or so and when I woke up in a pool of blood, and realized that my shoulder was injured badly. I decided I better go to the hospital. I got up and walked to the emergency room. I ended up getting a stitch in my nose and having my arm put back in the socket. I recovered pretty quickly and was okay after a few weeks, but it was a significant event in my life. I will never be walking drunk and texting again in the dark.

Tennis is one of my specialties but I was doing so poorly that I decided to sit the French Open out, which is one of the bigger tournaments of the year. So I was mostly a spectator at a time when I would ordinarily be throwing thousands around. So I'm watching the matches at the odd hours of the day, as the tournament is in France. I was able to enjoy most of the matches without ever getting the itch that I wanted to bet on it. One guy in particular though, named Wawarinka, brought the urge back. He's an older Swedish guy who used to have the potential to win any match when he was playing his best. His best was far behind him though, as he had been suffering through all kinds of injuries the last few years. And early on in the year, I had lost betting on him a couple times in big moments. Wawarinka was playing a new, young Greek guy who was already ranked top 10, Tsitsipas. I was watching this match with great interest and I fully expected Tsitsipas to win. The match ended up going very long and after being tied two sets to two sets, they started the fifth set. I was really surprised that Wawarinka had survived this song but I was so confident that his tired legs wouldn't allow him to cross the finish line. So with just a few seconds of thought, I put a 3k bet on Tsitsipas to win 2.5 something thousand. Almost immediately, Tsitispas had three chances to break Wawarink's serve. And even if he didn't end up winning the match after breaking serve, he would be such a huge favorite that I could cash out with a nice profit. Three chances he had......And he missed all of them. After that, I felt my stomach turning a little bit. Even after playing 4 or 5 hours of tennis, Wawarinka was still playing strong and now he had momentum. I couldn't take watching anymore and I decided to go for a run. I came back and saw that Wawarinka broke Tsistipas and won the match.

You know that part of being best friends is shared experiences and being able to remember them, talk about them and laugh. We had some great times when we were younger and hung out all the time, games, concerts ( the fight at ZZ top), and hunting. But, time moves on and people grow apart with distance, time,  and meeting other people. I know that is what happened to us. I feel really sad this happened because he was my best friend for almost 15 years. That being said, I know that we will keep in contact but it just wont be the same as it use to be. That makes me sad because Kreig was in my life for so long. I hope one day that we both can build a relationship as strong with someone else and be able to have those shared memories and laughs. I think that is important for people to have best friends and they don't come around often.", "label": "imagined", "group": "ECD3THQT"}

Now obviously, this can often come at odds with family and friend matters, it becomes increasingly difficult to have a personal life with people other than co-workers. Anyways, so yet again I was seeing some issues regarding my business schedule and how I could make time for family. I felt really bad, prior to working for this company my niece and I were extremely close. In fact, I practically raised her myself when her parents were not around to handle matters (things were pretty tight with them so they had to work a lot). I finally had made up my mind and firmly resolved I could not miss this. So I spoke with some of my co-workers and really, REALLY had to twist their arms about it. I didn't want to bring it up with upper-management because I knew they would react with cold disregard. In this company, your company is your personal life and if you aren't cut out for this, the door is right there. So I convinced my co-workers to cover this one project for me, it was not easy. I had to really sweeten the deal, I told each of them I would cover twice as many projects for them (if and when they needed it). I added in that whatever projected time off they had, I would take a lot of the paper work-load off their hands for them (we never REALLY get a vacation). My niece was overjoyed to see me and honestly, just that look on her face would've been worth 5X what I offered my coworkers. We celebrated not just that weekend but the following week as well. That girl is my life, I'll never be able to pass up an opportunity to be in her life again. Maybe it's time to find a new line of work..", "label": "imagined", "group": "F98PHSZQ"}

This was after much research as well as numerous quotes and checking out many companies. The amount for a new heat/air unit was something we had to take a loan out for. We wanted to get it right because it is a large expense. We chose the company, they came out and we went through our options of different units and chose the best one for our 1,600 sq ft house. We even chose to pay a little more for a brand we trusted. The workers tore out the old unit and put in the new. He did not put in a new thermostat as he forgot to bring the digital one we ordered, he came back 2 days later and asked how the unit was doing, I explained it was very loud and sounded like tennis shoes in a dryer, He checked out the system, made numerous adjustments but could not get the sound to go away. He was confused and asked that I allow him to go and research and call the manufacturer to get ideas on what the problems was. He came back the next day with what we thought was a solution but it still didnt work. In all of his confusion he requested a few more days assuring me it would be taken care of. Another couple of days passes and he comes back with yet another solution from the manufacturer. This again did not work.He then wanted his money but of course, he wasent going to pay him when my brand new air unit sounded like an old dryer. He said because of all of the trouble he would take 10% off of the cost. We agreed and he discounted the price by about $600. He also promised in writing he would take care of the problem or install a brand new unit.A week later he shows up with yet another solution that this time cut the noise down by 75%, we were happy with that and the discount. I paid his worker an additional $150 for other trunkline work done that was not included in the total price. He then said he needed to collect the rest of the money for the air conditioner?? we were shocked what?? you were paid in full. He proceeds to tell us that was a discount just until he got it fixed? What really? I never heard of someone especially a business giving a temporary discount and this was never discussed.

Throughout the night, I drank a lot, and got very drunk. In my drunken state, I decided that I should walk home. I lived close enough to the bar that it would be about a 20 minute walk home. On the way walking home, I tripped over a place where the concrete slabs were uneven. I fell to my right, and into a chain link fence, in front of the house on my street. As I stood back up, I could feel a lot of pain in my arm, and as I reached up I could feel blood on that part of my arm. I couldn't really see the cut since it was dark on the street, but I figured I must have scrapped my upper arm along a sharp piece of the fence. I held the cut and continued on quickly to my house, as it was bleeding quite a lot. I got inside, went to the bathroom and examined my arm. I was shocked by the amount of blood on my shirt, as I pulled it off. There was a lot of blood and the cut was quite deep. I did my best to wash my cut in the sink, before deciding to just use the shower instead, I washed the cut as well as I could and grabbed a towel, which I held very tightly to the cut. After holding the towel to my arm for about 15 to 20 minutes, the bleeding had slowed but not stopped. I replaced the towel with some clean paper towels, and held them tightly for another 10 minutes. Since I still couldn't get the bleeding to stop, I decided that I might need to go to the hospital. So I got some new paper towels, made a thick pad, and covered the cut, wrapped it in an ace bandage, put on a new clean shirt and called a lyft to go to the nearest hospital. When I got to the emergency room, I told the nurse what had happened, and filled out a lot of paperwork. Eventually I got to see a doctor, who looked at the cut, and decided I needed stitches. I got 5 stitches, and a tetanus shot, since I was cut by outdoor, probably dirty metal.

The pain became unbearable and I decided I needed to get up. I was barely able to walk to the kitchen. I took a 500mg pain reliever and several tums. I still wasn't sure at this point what kind of pain this was. I just knew my lower stomach was in the worst pain I have ever felt. I tried to go back to sleep, but was unable to. Suddenly a wave of nausea hit me and I sprinted to my bathroom to throw up. I ended up throwing up twice and realized something was seriously wrong.  I ended up asking my dad to bring me to the emergency room around 6am in the morning. They immediately brought me in and got me hooked up to an IV. Based on my symptoms alone they couldn't figure out what was wrong so they did a CAT scan of my stomach and it turns out my appendix was inflamed. My appendix was in danger of rupturing at any moment due to how inflamed it was and needed to be removed immediately.  Within 30 minutes of this finding I was undergoing surgery to get my appendix removed.

This time the wind took it and he had no idea where it went, so we had to accept it as gone for good.  We camped out only one night.  We were planning on camping more, but the boys complained too much the one time saying the ground was too hard and it was too cold out, so we got hotels the other nights.  For dinner when we camped we had veggie hot dogs and baked beans.  We bought some other things to go with the meal at a cute nearby store, but I forgot now what they were.  We ate lots of good food overall.  We had lots of wines and different cheeses and chocolates, and even got tequila one night.  We had pancakes for breakfast several times.  Pancakes are awesome.  We stopped at a few tag sales and got some fun finds.  We went to at least one arcade and we collected a lot of tickets and got some fun prizes.

It turns out they were in town for a family reunion and decided to stop over and celebrate with us. It was great to catch up with them. We had a lot of laughs. One of them was always the class clown and he got pretty drunk, hilarity ensued. People were shaking their heads, others were rolling on the ground laughing. I won't repeat any of it here because it could be pretty offensive. We watched fireworks well into the night and I ended up getting drunk for the first time in about 15 years. I felt like a high school kid again (at least until I sobered up later). It was just a really positive, almost magical night. One of those times where everything seems to come together and just make sense. When I looked back on it, I realized that I haven't been living my life the way I'd like.

However, after her father passed away, which was unfortunate, she did find the owner of the car.

He said no, but his girlfriend was a heroin IV drug user. First of all, in my right mind I would never meet up with anyone who had a significant other. Secondly, it's not even in my nature to  have sex with someone I wasn't intimately involved with. So I told him I was uncomfortable with the situation. After that, he became verbally abusive and threatened violence. It lasted about a month until I finally changed my phone number so the harassment would stop.

She realized I was made immature decisions and hoped that maybe if we met again in New York, we could get back together again. On hindsight, maybe she was letting me down easy.

Many times 'he kissed me' would be the main topic of conversation with my friends. But I never quite understood what the attraction was. I didn't have any desire for a boyfriend. I didn't even think sex sounded interesting or desirable. And still, to this day, I have not been interested in dating. I enjoy people. I love people. But I don't have an interest in finding 'love' like you see in the movies. Well, I was surprised and, I guess, even relieved when the therapist diagnosed me as 'asexual'.

It was memorable because I saw many types of wildlife such as deer, geese, snakes, and different types of bees. The only reason that I was able to see so much wildlife was because we went on hikes and long walks through wilderness areas where there weren't many people. The wildlife didn't appear to be afraid of us either so we were able to get pretty close. I think the most memorable thing that happened was when I saw a family of deer and really young one was sticking close to their mother. I had never seen a deer that young before and it was so early in the season. We also went to a lake in the mountains where we saw some birds nesting and eating among the ice. Because it was still winter, I guess the ice hasn't melted. That is where we saw some turtles and shore birds trying to enjoy the sun in winter. The weather was going to change soon (snow) so we were trying to get outdoors before the storm came in. We also went to a local trail where there were a bunch of gardens made specifically for insects and pollinators. I was able to spot a bunch of bees all over the place in those gardens and that was fun. Oh and the rocks and mountains we saw were full of history and interesting geology as well. The history of that area goes back millions of years and I heard that dinosaurs were found north of the area we explored. We did some other activities, but that was the most interesting by far.", "label": "retold", "group": "X1VF9N1S"}

We decided to pack up our things and take a spontaneous trip to the most remote part of Park. Once we arrived, we set our things down and set up camp. We unpacked the marshmallows and started up a fire. We sat around the fire and just talked. Talked about our childhood, jobs, girlfriends, sports, you name it. We talked away the afternoon and our nostalgic memories lit up our faces. Our past few years hadn't been easy, with Dad leaving us and mom being stressed out raising us alone. This was our chance to just forget about hardships and focus on our love. Finally we got up and hiked up the mountain before nightfall. Once we reached the apex, we were greeted by the most majestic view of the valley. The forest canopy glistened under the soft glow of the moonlight as far as the eye could. We gasped in delight.

It is big enough for both of us and has no rent or mortgage, so we live here. My brother has a child, my nephew. My nephew spends half his time living her and half living with his mother. The mother lives in a different city (not far, just a 30 or so minute drive) with her parents. I always had fun playing with my nephew but always knew I would only have a limited time to do so because he would have to live elsewhere to go to a decent school. I always thought my brother and the mother of his child had a good relationship. I don't know if they were ever officially married (though there was no wedding) but she uses his last name on her mail. Whenever she visits, she always ended the visit by telling my brother \"I love you\". But recently, I've noticed my brother spending a lot of time with a different woman. I say \"spending a lot of time with\" but it is clear they are dating. I don't really care about the relationship between my brother and the woman who gave birth to his child. However, seeing his relationship with this new woman gave me a bad feeling because I knew it would put my opportunity to see my nephew in Jeopardy. I've lived with my nephew since he was born. I watched him grow up, watched his personality began to develop. I grew very fond of him, though it is easy to grow found of a child. But I felt like I wouldn't be able to see him anymore if things continued. So one day, my nephew's mother found out about my brother's relationship with another woman. She didn't cry or scream like you see people do on tv or hear your neighbors do. She just took her son as usual. But she said she wouldn't bring him back. And so just like that, the little boy I've spent the last 5 years doting on and playing with was taken away. I am not close with his mother or her family, in fact I don't know her number or address, so I cannot go and visit. I just have to accept that my days playing with my nephew have ended.", "label": "recalled", "group": "YDQ0Y3ED"}

After raising enough money for my visa and the plane ticket along with all other necessary expenses I would be having on this trip I decided it was time to finally go on this long awaited trip. I booked my flight, told my younger brother about the trip but decided not to tell anyone else as I wanted to surprise them. On the day of the flight I took an Uber to the airport as the only person that new was my underage brother and therefore I had no one that could of drove me there. In the airport things were pretty simple I just checked in and since I just have a small luggage I didn't have to make any long lines in order to check in additional bags. The flight went smoothly as well and about an hour I was in the capital of Cuba.

All the cars and structures seemed like they were all from the 70's or older for the exception of tourist rental cars and the occasional modern Kia like small car. Thankfully I was fluent in the language and remembered by previews trips to Cuba as a kid and was able to find a person that guided me to a place in the city where I could rent a car for my week long stay. I drove directly to where my family lived about 3 hours away from the capital with no directions as I remembered how to get there. Seen my family once again was an awesome experience and brought back many memories from my childhood trips. The week went by faster that expected but I was able to see my siblings in the island as well as the rest of my family from both my moms and dads side, as well as experienced a whole other culture.

Simultaneously, I was looking at doing repairs and painting for to either sell myself at a higher price or through a realtor. I could do the work myself, with friends, or by hiring contractors. I preferred the latter. The problem was no one seemed to want the work! Two, maybe three contractors I contacted ghosted me by not showing up to give a bid. Was it the address? Holiday mood? I don't know, but it was frustrating. I had two friends who'd potentially help me knock out the work, but they wouldn't be available for a few weeks. It was stressful juggling all those options and not knowing which would pan out. Most would try one at a time, but I really wanted to get this settled and get out of town.

We said hello to each other and had a brief conversation. I could see that the dog he had on the leash was ill in some way, as opposed to the other healthy dog that was running free. We said goodbye and continued on our separate ways along the trail. A couple of days later, we ran into the same person at the same park but in a different section of the trail. I got to talk to her for a while about how her dog was going to have to have a tumor removed. It was so heartrending to witness an older dog and what getting ill and dying really entails. I was very touched by the whole situation, and I gave her dog a big hug since he was so adorable. After that we did not stay in touch with each other by phone or anything, but I promised to say hi the next time I ran into her there at the park. Sure enough we talked again just a couple of weeks later, and I saw the stitches and the bald spot from the surgery her dog underwent. He was doing well and was happy to meet my dog again, and the two of them ran around until eventually her other dog came back over as well. I felt personally touched by my direct experience with this poor dog, and I also felt good because I was able to contribute to his getting better by sharing some CBD dog treats with his owner. The next time I talked to her, she said that they seemed to have a positive effect on him and that she wanted to thank me for telling her about it.", "label": "recalled", "group": "VP2PLHHY"}

I chose the Detroit art museum because it is the closest to me. I looked at all of the paintings with care and made sure I paid attention to all the details of each painting. There were many nice paintings but there was on in particular that caught my eye. It was a painting of birds and watermelons. The brush strokes were detailed and smooth. The colors were muted but still seemed to pop out at you. The lines and definition were precise but also looked blended so that each object moved seamlessly into the other. i wanted to know who painted this. the plaque under the painting told me the name of the painting and the painter. I decided that I would look up more work by this artist. I wanted to learn from their style . I thought it would be great to paint like that. I decided to go to the gift shop in the museum and I just happened to find a book about the artists work. It was expensive but I thought it was worth the money. I bought it and rushed home that I could study the artists other paintings. It was a very productive and educational trip.", "label": "imagined", "group": "GNYYSWZE"}

We ended up getting a roomette which was a tiny private room on the train.  It forced us to be in close proximity to each other and there was no wifi on the train for her  to tune me out.  It was kind of fun.  However, the train included meals and the meals were amazing but on a train everything is small so they seat you at a table with strangers.  Part of the charm is to socialize with strangers.  We met all kinds of people and heard their stories and it made a huge impression on us.  There was a person who was so nice but had lost his job and family and had to take a hard and horrible job and his parents were helping to support him.  There was a very old person, maybe in his 80s who was a retired pallet salesperson and he was going to go visit his older brother.  After each meal, the experiences of the table mate would linger with my daughter and me and we would discuss the implications of our lives and ultimately how important family is.

The trip was 1 week long so we were constantly going out and enjoying ourselves since we wanted to do a lot in such a short amount of time. Once we arrived we got settled at our hotel, and then the next day we went out to see the volcanoes and then went to dinner. The day after that we went horseback riding in the rain forest and saw lots of different trees as well as a waterfall. The horseback riding was the most memorable part of the trip, as we were able to slowly climb up the mountain through the rain forest, and then saw the sunset over the ocean. The views we saw on the horseback riding trip were amazing. I was surprised by the vastness of the ocean and the beauty of the sunset. The next day we went golfing and saw plenty of mongoose, wild birds, and goats along the course. The next day we enjoyed lazing around on the beach and going to a luau. I ended up getting a bit of a sunburn that day, but it didn't stop me from enjoying the rest of the trip. The day after that we went to a lagoon and saw dolphins and sea turtles swimming in the ocean. The next morning we spent driving to the airport where we could see plenty of rock formations. We had a layover in Oahu that was 12 hours long, so we were able to explore the city outside of the airport and saw some of the ocean and beaches. The flora was very similar to that of the big island, and was very beautiful. The plane ride was very long and the time change was difficult to adjust to, but I'm glad I was able to experience the wildlife of Hawaii.", "label": "imagined", "group": "W9TFSZC8"}
{"id": "3AMW0RGHOEOLRLRWL4GDR4WB5V3PNZ", "text": "A few weeks ago, I was on my way home from an appointment when I saw a young, tired-looking homeless man sitting on the sidewalk across the street. I sat down next to him, and he told me his name was Casey. I asked Casey about his poetry (as I'm also a poet), if he was doing okay, if he had somewhere to sleep that night and if he knew where the shelters were in our area; he told me he did and that he had been to them before. After eating together, exchanging phone numbers, and talking for awhile, I asked him if he had somewhere to sleep that night, and he told me he would probably sleep somewhere on the sidewalk or at a bus stop like last night.  Following an impulse, I  told him he didn't have to sleep on the street, he could crash on my couch tonight if he wanted; if he wanted some AC, a phone charger outlet, a TV with Netflix, the chance to do some laundry, or a shower, he was more than welcome to crash for the night if he wanted to. He seemed surprised and hesitant, saying that offer seemed too good to be true. I know it was not a smart decision by me, but it just felt right. Casey came over, then we ended up drinking a few beers together and talking about life. He said he still had dreams and he was thankful he had it better than so many people. He told me how he went to VCU, how he wanted to start a business, and how he knew this period would be an important part of his story. He said he was thankful for time and the friendliness of people in the city; he said that he didn't resent people who don't help him, they just didn't have time, and he was thankful for everyone who does and that he is beyond fortunate and wants to be able to give back to society and that's why he writes. It touched me on a deeper than spiritual level and I think I will remember his honesty, hope, and gratitude for the rest of my life- it felt like I was talking to a modern-day prophet or Jesus himself, and I was shocked and humbled listening to his story. We then hung out on the couch eating tortilla chips with queso and watching the new season of the 100 on Netflix, a show we both love. The next morning Casey took a shower, washed his clothes, then we parted ways warmly as I thanked him for sharing that time with me. I told him he was a gift, and he had honored and inspired me. My decision to let a homeless stranger sleep in my home was an absolutely reckless one (basically a recipe for getting murdered), and I knew this (I'm extremely fortunate and lucky, and I recognize this decision should not become a habit). However, I was forever changed by what happened. It stretched my empathy, let me connect with someone different from me, and gave me the feeling of traveling without leaving my home. Becoming friends with Casey made me start to view homeless citizens more like people and not just as \"the homeless\". This experience utterly transformed me, and taught me how much I have to learn from the less fortunate, and how much more open to those lessons I should be.", "label": "recalled", "group": "K5FQ2N20"}

Everyone at work was sad to see me go and I knew it was going to be tough leaving work because I had developed special bonds with many coworkers since I had a couple of decades working there. I thought it was going to be tough spending more time at home than at work and that eventually I would get bored and want to go back to work, so I left my position with the option of coming back if I had ever decided to. As five months have passed since my retirement I never thought I would be enjoying living my life without the pressures of the job I loved doing for so many years. I am truly enjoying every moment of my retirement and I don't plan on doing any work for the time present. I love that I am able to see my granddaughter grow up and give her the time I always wanted to but previously was so busy to do. We have the greatest time together because she such a sweet little girl and I have had the opportunity to care for her four days out of the week while her parents work. I am also able to do that for my daughter so she could go to work knowing that her daughter is in the best hands. I love my life right now and I would not trade it for nothing. I also was able to pick up my old hobby of painting and this all happened just one afternoon when I was cleaning out my attic and I found all of my old paintings. I relived the joy I had as I painted them as an adolescent and I decided I would pick up the hobby once more. It was tough to get back into it but once I had started painting again, I rediscovered why I loved it so much. I am even teaching my granddaughter to paint and she loves it also. It is a great bonding time with her that I would not have had if I had not retired. I truly feel as if I am living my life as I should at this moment and I do not regret my decision to retire as difficult as it was in the beginning since I am so used to be active.

He had been taking a few steps here and there, walking with the assistance of us or the couch, but never just standing up on his own and walking! I was so excited! Maybe to excited because we were so loud yelling \"he's walking, o my goodness,\" that he fell shortly after. My husband had just went into the garage. He ran in the house, but had missed his first steps. He was sad that he missed it. We had him walk again for his Dad and so we could get it on video to send to our family.

We have many neighbors close-by and one of them came to welcome us at the house. He came with his wife with some house-warming gifts and some food. They told us that they had just moved in the neighborhood a few days before and were already used to it. They told us everything we needed to know about the neighborhood and where basic necessities are located. We spent about 2 hours together that evening. At some point during the night, my neighbor approached my wife and they talked. He seemed to be making her laugh and she was very entertained to talk to him. After they left, my wife started telling me how nice of a man he was. She said we should return the favor and go visit them. We went there one evening and as my neighbor's wife was preparing food, he couldn't keep his eyes off my wife and they talked a great deal. I could see that their bond was strengthening, and as we went back home, hardly a day passed by that she didn't mention him in a conversation in a complimentary manner.

He didn't come across as the type to go to one of those rallies or one who would support their ideology.  His social media didn't even provide any clues as to this.  I found out because another friend hit me up about some weird pictures on John's Facebook profile.  It turns out, he had created a setting to hide this from most of his friends and family.  He was only posted that stuff to his new 'friends'.  His old friends and family received a 'sanitized' version of his life.  This version was free from the hateful rhetoric on his unfiltered page.  He was obviously conflicted about it, or he would not have been filtering it from others.  I confronted John about it, as we had always been accepting of others and tolerant towards all but the intolerant.  On the phone call, he got really quiet for a second.  Then said that he was actually glad this came out and that he had long felt I was a 'naive libtard' and that I needed to wise up.  I was crushed that a friend had been lured down what I feel is a dark path of xenophobia and hatred.  I had no idea.  It pains me, but he has since cut off contact.  As a result of this, I have made a point to keep in closer contact with distant friends and to always let them know that I am there for them if they need to talk with someone.

Dinner was set to start at 6pm, and the prospect, a CEO of a prominent area hospital had ensured the restaurant staff would take care of us while we awaited his arrival. The meal was nothing short of magical, the filet mignon was impeccable, and the sides and cocktails were masterfully created. As dinner progressed, the conversation veered towards business, and we talked in depth about his hospital and the challenges he is facing. Our value proposition was strong.  The CEO was impressed with what we were able to bring to the table. We opted to skip dessert, but agreed to set up time for a meeting in the days to come. After saying our goodbyes, my two coworkers and I went to the bar to celebrate what was expected to be a highly lucrative deal. Our Old Fashions had never tasted better, and we decided to grab another table near the bar since our company was footing the bill. At the table next to ours, two beautiful women overheard us discussing hospital strategy and interjected themselves, they were doctors at another prestigious hospital nearby. The night progressed, and the 5 of us went on to another bar. The rest, as they say, is history.  6 months later, one of those girls is now my girlfriend, and the CEO is a happy client of ours.", "label": "recalled", "group": "PDZMFPAW"}

I went to the doctor and was prescribed Sertraline. The medication helped with the anxiety immediately. I continued on the course prescribed by my doctor: continue taking the Sertraline and increase the dose at regular weekly intervals. I began taking the smallest dose, 25 milligrams. In the following weeks I upped the dose to 50mg, then 100mg, then 150mg. After several days on the 150mg dose, I began feeling somewhat ill with stomach problems and a bit of increased anxiety. I was informed enough to know that these were symptoms of a potentially dangerous condition known as seratonin syndrome which is caused by elevated levels of seratonin in one's system. I immediately reduced my dosage of the Sertraline to 100mg. Knowing that I had another follow-up appointment with my doctor several days later I assumed that my seratonin levels would drop by the time of the appointment and then we could discuss weaning myself off of the Sertraline. In the time leading up to the appointment my seratonin levels continued to spike though, and while the negative symptoms were increasing (hyperactivity, shakiness, muscle tremors) the spike also triggered a breakthrough in my depression that was so powerful I can only equate it to what one might call a \"spiritual\" awakening. I went to my docotr's appointment as planned. I explained the situation and events and was put on an accelerated plan to get off of the medication. It took several days to come down from the seratonin syndrome, but after that I still felt the positive effects of the breakthrough. With the weight of the depression lifted I've been able to devote more energy to self-care activities such as going to the gym and meditation.", "label": "recalled", "group": "9TU1BKCU"}

A car holding a family of 5 had pulled out in front of an oncoming vehicle, who hit the car. A six year old and another child were killed. It was awful. It made me feel like never leaving our house on the weekends here in this crazy traffic.  Texans, in a generalized Oklahoman's opinion, are crazy drivers.

I took a week off to drive to the park, and to set up the campsite that I have reserved. The memorable moment of this trip would be when I was hiking in upper Yellowstone. After seeing several geysers, such as Old Faithful, I also wanted to go on some hikes and trails, specifically in Lamar Valley near the northeast entrance. It was in the afternoon, and I had already been able to experience and observe many bison and wildlife that I had normally never seen in the wild, only through pictures or a zoo setting. Seeing the wildlife in person, and often much closer than I would have preferred was a great experience in its own right, more so as I would recollect incidents of wildlife attacking people for venturing too close to them. Keeping my distance as much as I could on the trail, I kept on walking, taking in the scenery and occasionally getting wet from the occasional rain that basked the area. After walking for a bit, I would eventually come across an animal I had hoped to come across, but in person would fill me with fear and awe. A large bear ended up walking near the trail, a bear that had notably brown fur. I had previously encountered several black bears in my life, a couple even as I was driving in Yellowstone, but not this type of bear much less this close up. It was no doubt a grizzly bear, evident by its pronounced hump in its back, a feature not commonly shared with other bears. The distance between me and the bear no doubt put me in notable danger, although the bear was evidently focused on other things, likely foraging for food given the time of day. I attempted to remember all the advice and information I read about dealing with grizzly bears, such as not making sudden movements such as running away. Staying in place yet making my presence known, the bear would eventually walk away from the trail, ending any potential danger from the confrontation. Despite the danger, I was glad to experience and photograph up close a grizzly bear, given how synonymous it is to the park, and even the state I traveled from. It would have been possible that I could hike in Yellowstone for hours on end, even days and not come across a grizzly bear, at any distance given timing or even luck.

Both had had a brain surgery to help them, but the cysts (both), are still there. These cysts are affecting their lives, they have to be going to see the Doctor and be checking them. Just a week ago, my little grandson had a surgery again, I went to visit him to the Hospital, and he was looking so delicate, so blue, very, very pale. I am so worried about them, but other than that, when the cysts are not acting, they are healthy, normal, very, very intelligent, I would say that they are geniouses. Really, really smart. And happy. I just love them. They don`t live with me, but they come visit. I love to play with my grandson, he is the one that plays with me. Last night, we were playing, and I showed to him a chess box. We placed all the pieces in the board and we had fun with them. I am so happy he is doing well. He has to wear a helmet because his skull is so thin that one fall could be fatal.

A male passenger across from me kept cursing during his phone conversation.  The bus driver had no qualms with correcting the young man's outbursts.  Later during the drive, the bus driver attempted her best to not doze off.  During the last leg of the trip she swerved a few times. To keep herself awake, she started to hum.  The bus driver hummed louder and louder as we progressed closer and closer to the bus/train station.  I was amused to the point of giggling.  My daughter was not.  My daughter didn't get much sleep the night before our trip, and she had hoped she would make up for it during our bus ride.  When my daughter and I ended our bus trip and arrived in Indiana, we experienced a dull four hour layover.  Maybe it was dull because it was the wee-hours of the morning.  But she and I amused ourselves by cracking jokes and making silly comments. After the long four hours, we finally boarded the train and had begun our cozy and adventurous ride to Utah.  Our first stop was in Chicago.  My daughter and I had to transfer ourselves and our luggage to another train.  The customer service gentleman who assisted us with the transfer was kind, comedic and inquisitive.  He and I exchanged jests and sarcasms after he made an inquiry concerning our reasons for going to Utah.  The customer service gentleman also joked about the size of my daughter's luggage.  He stated that he was sure that he would be able to fit inside of the suitcase and tag along with us.  My daughter and I were refreshed by the comical exchange with the customer service gentleman.  After transferring our luggage, my daughter and I discovered the food court in the train station ate a delicious meal, and then made our way to the Chicago train station waiting area to begin the last half of our adventure.", "label": "recalled", "group": "PFZ60IVQ"}

There were some small things that were more current, but mostly, the place was still very much the same, with the same vibe. Then there were the people. And that's when I could see time had passed, although more for some than others. I had wondered whether or not it would be an occasion to talk to people I didn't use to be close to. You know, like, now we're all adults and we've changed so we're more open to other things and it's easy to reach out to someone and just get to know them - more than back then. But actually, no. The groups reformed almost immediately as they were back then. And I suppose it's normal. When I got there, my old friends had pretty much all arrived and were in a corner, chatting very happily. They spotted me and called to me and that was it. Back to the good old times. It was so much fun to see them again. Most of them I had totally lost track of, although I'm still in touch with two of them. So there was a lot of catching up. But also a lot of reminiscing. And the result was completely seamless and very lighthearted and breezy.  Time flew by. And then it was 2 AM and we were the last crew standing and they had to kick us out.

About ten minutes outside of Des Moines, my youngest child started complaining of feeling sick and developed a rash all over his body. The GPS told me we were very close to a hospital, so I made my way there as quickly as possible. When we got to the emergency room, Logan could barely breathe. The nurse on duty deemed the case to be of utmost priority, so she wheeled him in to see the doctor immediately. My wife, my other four children, and I waited anxiously for someone to give us an update. After about half an hour, a doctor approached us and said, to our relief, that Logan was just fine. It turned out he had an allergic reaction to the shrimp salad he ate at lunch. He has a shellfish allergy and needs to avoid most seafood from now on. The doctor administered an EpiPen which opened his airway and allowed him to breathe easier again. They induced vomiting which helped him feel better. He still had a rash on his body, but it was starting to go down. After a couple more hours of observation, he was released from the hospital and we resumed our journey.

Unfortunately, there happened to be someone else there, someone who didn't realize we were, and had left their young dog off leash to run around.

Jake wasn't very pleased with the sudden stranger, a ball of noise and energy, running up to us uninvited. As the owner ran over, shouting his dog's name, Jake grumbled at the puppy. The younger dog did not like Jake's defensive nature, and barking escalated between them. Eventually, the pup got too close, and Jake lunged for the bite. Once dogs start fighting, it is impossible to deter them. No amount of yelling, throwing water, or pulling on the leash will snap them out of it. We both had to grab our dogs by the midsections, lift their hind legs and drag them away from each other between bites. Luckily, there were no wounds, only trails of saliva and continued barking. \"Nice dog,\" the man said to me sarcastically as he dragged his puppy away, trying to finally affix his leash.

I had to wake at around 4:45 a.m. and dress in the freezing cold in the dark, and drive to a coffee house on icy roads to use the restroom and have a bite to eat. Then I walked on icy roads to the bus stop, leaving my car in a safe parking space. The bus trip was about two hours with one transfer to a second bus.

Two of them glared at me with hatred most of the day. At lunch we took a quick break and I ate a pouch of lentils and rice I had brought (no microwave available to heat it). One attorney spent most of the day questioning me so they could say they had many questions left and force me to return a second day.

Our bodies are wonderfully designed with complex pathways designed to eliminate toxins. As apart of my self-learning, I began to research the supplement, alpha-lipoic acid. Convinced that this supplement could be beneficial, I began taking this common supplement. If one believes the hype, one could expect miraculous improvements in one's health if detoxification is impaired.  Upon taking the supplement, I noticed unexpected physical responses that were not in line with improvement in health. This caused me to dig deeper into this supplement. In the process, I came across the knowledgeable scientist from Quicksilver Scientific, Dr. Christopher Shade. It was during one of his presentations that I learned how the body can have blocks in detoxification as a result of exposure to toxic mold. This surprising fact caused a light bulb to go off in my mind. I had personal experience with toxic mold exposure, and this fact led me to believe that my unexpectedly lackluster response to alpha-lipoic acid may be due to a mold-induced block in my own detoxification system. Thankfully, there are good strategies for dealing with this sort of block in detoxification, and products designed carefully and comprehensively to assist in maximizing activation and functioning on the detoxification system. I encourage any reader to explore the Quicksilver Scientific range of detox products, and especially the Push Catch System, as well as to take advantage of the available teaching resources and seminars presentations available online from Dr. Christopher Shade.", "label": "retold", "group": "OMOB0KLB"}

She loves pancakes so IHOP was the perfect place for her to eat.  We both had a large stack of pancakes and left the restaurant feeling great.  After breakfast we went to a early movie.  The Lion King was playing and she really wanted to see it.  Since I had seen the original I thought it would be interesting to take her to see the new version.  I bought the tickets and we went in and got popcorn and drinks.  We found some seats in the middle of the theater and sat back to enjoy the movie.  The movie was really good and brought back memories from my childhood.  My niece also loved the movie.  It was now mid afternoon and we decide to go to the skating rink.  Both her and I like to skate so it was a good way to pass the time.  After about a 20 minute drive we arrived at the rink and noticed that the parking lot was not too full.  That was good because it would mean the rink had less people on it and more space to skate.  We went inside and rented our skates.  We spent the next three hours blissfully skating in a nice oval direction.  The music was good and it was not that crowded so the experience was really nice.  When skating I never seem to get tired.  I think it is because I enjoy it so much.  When we left the skating rink it was late afternoon and we were hungry so I took her to Chi Fil A to get some sandwiches.  She loves that restaurant.  We took the food home and waited for her father to get off work.  After eating the food and spending time with her father my niece fell asleep on the couch.

It's also so hot here in south Florida that I knew he would die if I left him outside in the bushes like that. I wondered where his mom and litter mates were. Was he abandoned for being sick or injured? Did the mom cat get run over or was unable to come back for kitten for some reason? I used a Gatorade to try and wash off the ants because it was all I had. The kitten had blue eyes and it was crying loudly, the kind of cry a human baby makes when it's really in distress. I know you should not pour any cold water on a kitten that age because they can't regulate their body temperature, but it was a quick decision to pour the room temperature Gatorade on the kitten just out of desperation. I took the kitten home and spent so much time bathing him and then even used a blow dryer on low to make sure it was completely dry. There were dead ants and some fleas in my bathroom sink when I was done. I got a cat carrier and some blankets, making sure he was all set up for the night, but was also really careful not to put him somewhere he would smother himself by accident. I got put uncooked rice in a sock and warmed it in the microwave to keep the baby warm. The Gatorade was such a bad, sticky choice, but I really didn't know how I was supposed to drive when there was a crying kitten and ants literally swarmed all over it. It's poor little eyes and butt had piles of ants and I knew the right thing to do, the only thing to do, would be take the kitten out of the parking lot. I really can't afford to foster more pets. It's so hard to find a rescue to pay for the vetting. This kitten needed about thirty dollars worth of supplies, a bottle and kitten KMR powdered formula, just to get through the next few days. He also needed to be fed and to help eliminate every two to three hours. That's twelve feedings a day and twelve times I had to help him pee and poop. Kittens are a lot of work! As I stood there in the parking lot though, I knew if I walked away he would die. That kitty ended up getting adopted three months later when he was about three and a half months old. I put all my time and money into him and then my neighbor's mother who lives in the city next to us adopted him. She calls him Bear and every time I see my neighbor walking her dog we talk about how fat he has gotten and how much her mom is obsessed with her kitty.", "label": "retold", "group": "1TN8RVR2"}

Even though I was hurting I had friends and family who depended on me. I had no other choice but to be strong for everyone else. I had to push my pain aside to help those that I love deal with their pain. It is funny that when I thought I was doing something just for my friends and family I was actually doing something for myself too. Pushing my feelings aside and helping others I was some how able to deal with this pain and tragedy when I thought I couldn't. Allowing myself to think and put someone else first actually helped me to sort my feelings out subconsciously. Sharing someone else's burden may be one of the best decisions I have ever made, it sure helped me to deal with my thoughts and feelings in a more positive way than usual. From now on I vow to always help others no matter what I am going through and maybe sadness will have no control over my life anymore. I can gather comfort in being someone that is strong and able to lift other people i care about up in their times of need. Sometimes caring for others more than yourself is the best thing you can do as a friend and a help. You don't realize I guess until the horrible tragedy calms down or passes that you actually have dealt with it in a positive way and that you have helped someone else in probably the best way you could. I think God designs us that way. I think we are made to be servants of not only him but his people. I think through his purpose that is how we can gain comfort in such a horrible time. Had I not stepped up to help them I would have been at home in bed wallowing in sadness and depression with little comfort. I can proudly say this time diary, I didn't do that.

Therefor I had to drive back to my parents house every night, and then return back to my apartment, to look for the cat.

I had been feeling under the weather around that time and it didn't seem like I was getting any better. I had already been to the doctor twice in two weeks, but the doctor told me that all of the tests came back negative for any of the likely causes. He said that it was likely just a cold that has been aggravated by stress and that it would resolve itself with time. I woke up one morning and felt worse than I have ever felt. This caused me to get my self very wound up and have another panic attack. Once I was able to gather myself, I drove myself to the emergency room. The doctor there conducted all of the basic tests and still nothing was out of the ordinary. Being panicked, I  insisted that something was wrong and asked if there were any other tests that they could run. The doctor said yes, but also informed me that my insurance would likely not cover the costs of the additional tests. Being so anxious and upset, I agreed to still have the tests, even though my savings weren't anything special. So they ran a few additional tests and everything still came back negative. I eventually was convinced to go home and once again, wait and see if things got better. Of course, within a few days I was feeling as good as new.

While we were down there, we got to meet up with a special person in my life that I served with in the United States Marine Corps. I had not seen this friend for five years so it was a great reunion for us to get together and catch up. While in Destin, Florida, we stayed at a condo that was right on the beach. The views from our room were amazing and the water was crystal clear. We were also amazed at how beautiful and white the sand was. It felt like we were walking on silk. Aside from hanging out on the beach all day, we also went to out to eat at some very nice restaurants. I got to eat some fresh seafood. We're from Ohio so the seafood we can get in Florida is not like the seafood we can get in Ohio. On one of the nights we went out to play miniature golf.

This on its own is already a sweet thing for friends to do, but for me it was especially great. I've never liked celebrating my birthday, as on the years I have celebrated my birthday, bad things have happened that day. As a result, I've built up a kind of superstition around my birthday, and usually avoid going out. I'd told my friends that this year, as per usual, I planned on having a nice quiet day, go to the gym, treat myself to some nice food, maybe take the time to make a fun cocktail for myself or buy some expensive beer. They said it was fine, but they wanted to take my out to brunch, so I acquiesced, because I knew that they saw my simple birthdays as a sad thing, despite that not being my attitude towards them. I mostly agreed for their sake, so they wouldn't be worried about me. When I left the apartment that day, I thought we'd just be getting lunch and I'd have my quiet day. Instead, one of my friends was waiting outside with a rental car. They gave me a card and told me to go back in and pack a weekend's worth of clothes. I was floored, and obviously I went back inside to pack. I felt bad they were spending so much money on me when I knew I'd never be able to do the same for them, but since everything had already been paid for, I couldn't let it go to waste. To be entirely honest, there was a small part of me that wishes they hadn't done it, because it was the exact opposite of what I asked them to do: every year I ask to not receive gifts, partly because I myself am bad at giving gifts, and partly because I know I can't afford to give the kinds of gifts they can, and would feel bad about it. This, of course, was larger than any git I'd ever received, and larger than I could ever give, and to a certain degree, inside, it bothered me. But, I knew my friends weren't looking for repayment, and they were doing it out of kindness and a genuine care for me, so I shelved my pride and let myself have fun. We went to Philly and stayed at a hotel, swam in the pool, ate awesome food, and generally lazed around for the weekend, exploring the city and seeing the sights.

He is a very good baby and she didn't hesitate to retrieve him upon him waking up from a nap.   I worried/warned her of the spoiling and that it may result in habits harder to break for both of them in the future     Slowly she had allowed the responsibilities to be shared with me involving feeding and caring for her son.  Assistance she claimed she never had with her her husband before.   I was happy to help and offer her assistance, not only because I still wished to date her, but because none of my children live with me any longer and it was a great reminisce time for myself.   As I had stated earlier, I allowed her to come and go as she pleased and I never told her what to do or set any rules what-so-ever for her.  This resulted in her having freedom she had not had for awhile.  Self-control is not in the top 10 best traits that she possesses and she over indulged herself to say the least.  She started to seek 'the party life' versus 'the stay at home mom life' that she had been for x amount of time.   Her son, although easy for me to handle and never was a direct issue, had started to miss his mom as much as he had her prior.   She was very capable and she never neglected her son in anyway.  However, I had said to her soon as I started to notice the change in degree of quality care she was giving him, compared to when she first got here.      She had stopped holding him while he drank from a bottle and started propping it up everytime.  I ad originally commented on how amazed I was about him not addicted to a pacifier and she expressed her worry of dental problems if she got him one.  Suddenly she had boughten him and got frustrated with him because wasn't seeming to want the pacifier she gave him.  So I had pointed out to her these changes I noticed that had been undesirable.  She argued with me, denied the possibility, accused my reasons for ulterior motivations and started to very obviously disrespect me at any given time.   So, after a few days of this I had no choice but to ask her to leave.

It was my friend Jessica's birthday and we all went and did karaoke.  I drove to the event, which was incredibly stupid because I knew I was going to be drinking and when I drink I also drink too much.  The karaoke place was about two miles from my house.  Over the course of the evening I proceeded to get drunker and drunker as did everyone else. I dont think we even had a DD or someone who was just drinking a little bit. When the end of the night came, which had been a lot of fun, we all kind of staggered out to the parking lot. I initially got in my car deciding I would drive home, but I suddenly couldn't even remember where I was in the city. Like, I could not think of which direction to drive in to get to my house. I finally got my phone out and kind of fought with it for probably 15 minutes until I finally was able to update my credit card information in the Uber app and contacted a driver. When I got home it was probably 2:30 in the morning and I immediately passed out.  When I came to around 7:30 I looked at my phone and had dozens of missed calls and missed messages on my phone and in my group message.  It turns out one of my friend's had gotten caught up at a DUI checkpoint and was calling from jail asking for assistance.  He was calling to know if he should take a breathalyzer or just deny it and wanted us to research what to do online. I missed all the frantic messages from my friends though, which I would have been worthless anyway in that situation because I was so out of it. He also wanted us to come bail him out but our jail must be too overcrowded because they didn't hold him and just released him at around 9 in the morning, even though he was still legally drunk, I\"m sure. We did have to take him to get his car from an impound lot.  The whole experience was terrible, but I also felt relief for myself.", "label": "recalled", "group": "Z2OTKAHC"}

(stand by me, by: Ben E. King).  Then, after we finished walking up and down the halls, we got an all inclusive hospital meal! ha ha! dinner for two! i believe it was a pot roast with mashed potatoes, carrots, apple sauce and some sparkling juice, with our plastic champagne glasses. :)  Finally, the whirlpool tub is \"technically\" only meant for the mother to help soothe her while her body contracts. once the nurses left the room we both got in the whirlpool! ha ha! it was a nice, relaxing, and intimate time. My boyfriend was such an awesome support, and it really made me realize the abundance of love we have for each other, we made and anxious time so memorable and stress free. Of course the best time was welcoming our brand new baby boy into the world. I've never seen my boyfriend so vulnerable, i could tell in that instant he fell in love like never before.", "label": "recalled", "group": "TCG366OO"}

The day was already rushed because it is so easy to get behind and we had a strict deadline for when the wedding needed to be over. We finally arrived at the venue around 2pm. We began to take some family photos and some first look photos, and the day was still very sunny. I went inside to freshen up before the ceremony at 5, and I noticed it was starting to get darker and windy. I could hear commotion out in the hall, and finally, a huge crack of thunder. All of the guests had already arrived, so they ran to help my husband get the chairs out of the rain and into the banquet hall. They just made it before a deluge of rain. The storm passed in about 15 minutes, and then we had to set everything up outside again. However, the wedding really came together with all of our friends and family helping out.

I have been accustomed to some level of violence, growing up in an impoverished neighborhood... but this, was different. About 4 weeks ago, I was struck by an oncoming vehicle in a high speed accident. It happened so quickly, that I initially thought I was okay. It wasn't til about 30 seconds after the accident that I realized the side of my shoulder and my arm had 2 severe gashes. These weren't scrapes or cuts, but inch deep wounds that were 2 inches in length. I panicked, never imagined the reality of injuries that bad to myself. No one else was injured somehow, even though the other persons vehicle had 3 people in it, and I was just by myself.  If I would have had a passenger, they would have likely been hit on their left arm and possibly had organ damage near the chest area. By the time I got to the hospital, I already lost a lot of blood and felt dizzy. I was awake the entire time they were stitching my arm and shoulder but I had a painkiller shot. I remember feeling interested in the wound after I got the painkiller shot and it was being stitched up. I'm thankful that nobody else was injured, and that I wasn't killed or permanently injured. Although, it did end up being the other drivers fault, and his insurance had to buy me a new car because mine was totaled. This was one of the most traumatic experiences that has ever happened to me in my life. That being said, I would feel way worse about it, if someone intentionally did it to me.

Because my siblings had already left the house and I was going to be leaving for college the following fall, my parents were ready to downsize. It was an emotional decision because my siblings and I had been raised in this home and my parents had lived there before any of us were even born. So last winter we set our sights on fixing anything that needed fixing in order to put our home up for sale. This included painting the walls, a new roof, and new siding in some areas. At the end of winter, our house was ready for the real estate market. We were all very anxious about putting the house on the market. My parents began looking for a new place to live and my siblings and I were trying to imagine a world in which we did not come home to the house we had grown up in and made so many memories in. After a couple of months on the market and a price drop, the home finally had an offer at the beginning of summer. But that is also where the headache began for myself and my parents. The people who put in the offer made too many demands including leaving some furniture and appliance items that we had planned to take with. After we conceded to some of what they wanted, the process of them getting verified to actually by the house turned in to a long drawn out process. In fact, mid way through summer my parents were just ready to be done with it as they had envisioned it going much smoother. My parents had to resign documents many times and were continuously told that the final offer might not go through, so they were stuck between purchasing their new home or waiting. Finally, at the tail end of summer, just as I was heading off to college, the offer went through and my parents were given 30 days to leave the home. By that point, I was already preparing to leave for college so it didn't seem to take as much of a toll on me as I thought it would. My parents were so fed up with how the process went, that they too were ready to say goodbye.

After a long but extremely fun ride, we finally arrived at Big Bend Ranch State Park.  I had heard this place was beautiful and thought camping under the night sky would give us all a break from the technology that seems to run our lives on any normal day.  I found the perfect spot, surrounded by towering mountains on one side and a clear view of the night sky on the other.  I had a rough time getting the tent up while everyone else went on a hike, but, finally I persevered.  Later, we sat around a crackling fire to roast marshmallows and hot dogs.  We laughed and sighed as we told each other our best ghost stories.  Then, as the sun finally dipped completely out of sight, an awe-inspiring thing happened.

I got my life back in tracks shortly after the divorce was official by getting back in the gym, spending time with family and friends, and seeing a therapist. I worked my hardest to be truly happy and content on my own, not feeling like I needed a partner to complete me. Shortly after the divorce, I met a girl at a Superbowl party I attended. I was looking to date again, but this came very unexpected, as I showed up to the party and had never previously seen this woman. She was a mutual friend of two of my closest friends, and we chatted briefly. After adding each other on Facebook following the party, we spent a few weeks texting and talking at night.

Her cardiologist came to see her that evening at the hospital and decided to do a heart catherization. As a result of the procedure, the major artery in her leg became blocked, and she lost feeling in her leg as it began turning blue. The cardiologist injected her with a large amount of blood thinner which helped get some circulation to the leg and sent her over to a different hospital which had a vascular surgeon. The surgeon had to do a somewhat radical procedure of cutting deeply down both sides of her lower leg, as well as locating the blockage and removing it. The leg had been without circulation long enough that swelling was going to be severe, and without the cutting, the swelling would have killed the nerve in the leg. It took 4 to 5 months for her to recover enough to walk without aid of a wheelchair or walker. In that time I had to take care of her in between nurse visits, including all home maintenance (cleaning, cooking, laundry, etc). I was confined to home as well as she was because she couldn't be left alone. It was a tragic experience for her, and a shocking one for me to see the extent of the surgical damage and the slow healing process. The process for my wife was excruciating. Nurses came by every day for 2 weeks to change the dressing on her leg. Then for months after, twice per week. Also, once a week for months my wife had to go to a clinic to be evaluated by a wound specialist.

That thought quickly went out the window as went deeper into the woods into unfamiliar territory that I did not know about. What I thought was the right way back seemed to lead to more confusion with trees galore, and streams surrounding us. \"This does not seem right at all. Where are we?\" I kept saying to myself mentally, and occasionally to the two furry friends I had right next to me. The only difference this time is they were panting and breathing heavy. Their movements were slowed, at this point I was getting nervous.. I did not know how long we were in the woods, wandering around with me trying to use my intuition and internal sense of direction. Starting to become fearful, I received a sign that I never thought was possible. In the trees next to me where \"P\"'s or \"9\"'s made of felt. They were hanging off random tree branches and it seemed so out of place. I immediately thought \"Maybe this is a sign from God and the angels about how to get home?\" I thought to myself that this must mean I have to go back to the 9'oclock direction, aka to the left. Half an hour of walking later (or so it seemed) and with my dogs nearing the end span of their endurance with their movements very slowed and heavy breathing, there was hope! We were nearing familiar territory getting closer to our home! \"Almost there!\" I kept telling my dogs and myself. Ralphie and KC were exhausted! I was fearful, but filled with hope. We cleared through the woods and finally reached our destination -- home sweet home! I picked at least a dozen ticks off each dog and got a minor scalding from my stepdad about taking them for long walks.

She opened the door, walked inside, turned around and came back out immediately announcing that she didn't have to \"go after all\" and left. I refused to have anyone over and as a result, invitations to friend's houses came less and less frequently. I even overheard two friends say they wondered why I always came to their houses but never \"returned the favor\". The re-model was costly but the transformation was amazing.

Type 1 Diabetes is when the autoimmune system attacks the pancreas and destroys the pancreas' ability to regulate blood sugar.  Due to this, a Type 1 Diabetic has to inject insulin everyday in order to live.  Unfortunately, while you can do a good job managing your blood sugars using insulin, you simply can't compare to a fully functioning pancreas and problems will occur as a result.  In May, I was at home on a Saturday cooking dinner.  I was having brown rice and baked chicken breasts.   Due to the carbohydrates that are in rice, I had to take insulin in order for my body to process the brown rice.  I took my insulin around 20 minutes before I ate.   I planned to eat a lot(for me) of brown rice that evening so I took a much larger than normal dose of insulin.  After I prepared my food, I sat down and began to eat my chicken breasts first.  I tried a special barbecue sauce on the chicken breasts and they tasted wonderful.   I had no problems devouring the chicken breasts.  After I finished the chicken breast, I started to eat the brown rice.  However, I started to feel extremely and uncomfortably full to the point where I became nauseated.   Unfortunately, at that time the insulin that I took for the brown rice started to kick in some my blood sugar dropped down to dangerously low levels.  I tried to eat the rice to get my blood sugar back up, but I was so full that I couldn't do it.  At that time, the effects of low blood sugar were kicking in.  I was sweating heavily and shaking.  I had trouble moving.  My ability to think and problem solve took a huge hit.  I was slowly wandering around my apartment looking for something that I could eat that wouldn't cause me to vomit which would make it even harder to get my blood sugar back up.  That's when I found some Powerbar Energy Gels that I use when I exercise.  They weren't heavy on your stomach and they have a lot of carbohydrates which would counteract the insulin.  I downed a few packets of the gels and in 20-25 minutes I started to feel better.  I had survived, but it is a situation that still scares me to this day.", "label": "recalled", "group": "4SLOQWDX"}

It was my birthday and everyone just wanted to go wild. After arriving back home from the bar, we began taking shots of the tequila. It was very fun and we had some good electronic music playing in the background. Apparently, we ended up going back out to Pacific Beach and bar hopping.

About 10 minutes later I got another phone call that my mom was in the hospital and my dad asked if I could come up to the hospital. I started to panic, kissed my husband and ran out the door. When I arrived at the hospital I found out that my mother was having a heart attack. I was scared but quickly found out that she was okay. That is when the anger set in. I was angry at my dad for not immediately telling me what was happening. I was angry with my mom for refusing the ambulance at immediate care and thinking they could drive to the hospital. I was angry at them both for not having the common sense to go to the hospital immediately instead of bothering with immediate care. After mom was admitted we found out that she would need a heart cath. She was trying to be brave and strong and kept saying she was fine and didn't need the heart cath, she was just under too much stress at work.  The next day she had her procedure and we found out she had a 99% blockage. I am still not happy with how the situation happened and I am not comfortable with the way she takes care of herself.

I go to many concerts and it is one of my favorite things to do so I knew I could really enjoy this experience. From seeing band members at the airport when I landed to being in the same boarding group I was excited for the week. There were bands on the cruise who I had been a fan of for years and they were all very accessible and laid back that you could sit and chat with them just like they are a regular person. There was one band in particular who I enjoyed and I was really looking forward to and they were only doing one performance on the cruise the first night. It was in a small lobby area with open balconies looking down, the area was packed full and the performance seemed so intimate and special that I still get goosebumps thinking about it. The singer commented that they were just guys who like sitting around a fire with an acoustic guitar and singing so they were going to do a sing-along, he and one of the guitarists sat on the bar and sang a cover and had everyone watching join in. All the concerts I go to and this was by far one that I will never forget. One other really unique part of this cruise is that they not only have complete bands but they also have individual musicians who do an all star jam type performance of famous covers. Before going I was told to not miss those performances and I made sure to watch each time they had one and was not disappointed at all. I have talked with bands since the cruise when they came to my city on tour and they all talk fondly about what a great time they had so it's really cool that both bands and attendees all have great experiences. The other thing that I really enjoyed is that anywhere you went during the cruise; the dining room or off the boat at ports, you would run into band members who were just having a great time and enjoying their vacation as well. There were no egos at all. We have booked to go back on the cruise next year and I'm getting excited because it's getting closer. I feel like I almost planned too much for this past year and now I know that it's ok to just go with the flow and relax.", "label": "retold", "group": "DQ4JQLCN"}

Needless to say from the start of my entry, that is not what happened at all.   In all our years, this was the first time he took me home with him for the holidays.  We usually went to my family events because his parents usually traveled to Peru for the holidays.  Since his grandmother had passed, they had no reason to go this year. and his mother made all kinds of elaborate plans that would span 5 days.  He must have asked me a thousand times if I wanted to go or not, or if I would be comfortable with all of his family speaking Spanish.  I am fluent - he knows this.  But, I thought he was just being considerate seeing that I am the only white person coming - the only person who does not have Hispanic roots, period. I assured him that I was fine, and I would be prepared for a bit of a cold shoulder coming at me.  I was tougher than I looked.  We arrived at his parents home on the 23rd of December.  The house was brightly decorated inside and out, and it smelled of cooking  - you know how it smells when there are several types of food layered on top of another - but it just smells like home?  Yes, like that.  Everyone was incredibly gracious and kind, and I made a good impression by helping with cooking, clean up, set up and just having general conversation with his family - even his allegedly racist great uncle. Oddly enough, Devan seemed angry that they were warming up to me so well, making snide comments like they liked me more than him, etc.  Often, I found myself alone with his family members while he was no where to be found, or off in a corner messing with his phone.   We left on the 28th, and had plans for a bug NYE party in the city - tickets I had paid $400 for.  He called me on NYE at 8pm (and hour AFTER he was suppose to meet me) and said that he had taken me to his family's home to see if he could get their approval before marrying me.  He SAID they were only being polite and that NO ONE actually liked me, and he was sorry, but he just couldn't be with someone that they did not approve of.  I must have cried for a week, but eventually I began to feel that he was lying because there was no way I could have misinterpreted the situation that badly for 5 whole days.  I called his mother to ask if I had left my Hermes scarf there (I knew I hadn't) and she talked my ear off for over an hour, and said how she couldn't wait until Easter so we could be together again, and that she had told Devan she couldn't wait to have a new daughter - that lying imp used his family as an excuse!", "label": "imagined", "group": "CAWUC75T"}

I had moved to three different departments, went through various managers, but was still doing menial customer service types of jobs. Even though I was making a decent amount of money, the jobs were very boring and I was not at all challenged. I was promoted into leadership and that lasted less than a year due to upper management deciding to restructure departments. I was back to doing menial work and to add insult to injury, another person in my department slyly slid into my old role (without the title or the raise) and stopped doing his assigned job. I was appalled that this was allowed. I chose to go back to school as I felt my future (despite glowing reviews and taking the lead during FDA audits) was limited. I applied to my alma mater's MBA program and was accepted one week later. I was happy and proud of myself to finally doing what I have been talking about doing for years. When school started, I was incredibly busy and was assigned even more work at work. I attempted to negotiate a raise, but was told that despite doing the work of 4 people ( I was the lead of 3 other people, who were reassigned to other teams when those teams workload exploded), my work was not \"risky\" therefore I should not be paid more than other people on the overall team. That made no sense as I had 10 years of seniority over all but one other person, had a proven track record, and was highly sought out by other teams as a SME during audits. I was also in a MBA program, thus bringing more value to the company. School is my saving grace.

At first, I thought I must have overdone some recent jogging or hiking and that the pain would dissipate in a few days. However, after a couple of weeks the pain remained. I went to an acupuncturist whom I go to from time to time for pain relief, and she seemed to think it was arthritis. After seeing her, I was pretty down, thinking this knee pain was something permanent and a condition I would need to contend with for the rest of my life. I was especially grieving giving up hiking, as this is one of my favorite hobbies. I decided to get a blood test to rule out rheumatoid arthritis. The blood test came back inconclusive, so I went to see a rheumatologist. He did think the pain was due to arthritis. He said I had three options: (1) take a biologic for the symptoms, (2) get surgery or (3) or watch and wait and see how the pain is six months from now. I decided on the watch and wait method, as I thought the other two options had some significant downsides.  Getting a diagnosis of arthritis has been somewhat depressing as I thought I wouldn't run into this type of health issue until my 60s, however, you never know what life has in store for you.

Knowing how to say goodbye, and dealing with the sense of loss that can follow, is part of being a parent. The pain of separation can go far beyond simply missing your son or daughter after they're gone. Some parents feel a very real sense of grief and loss; a lack of purpose or control. Because having a child leave home to go to university is regarded as a measure of success \u2013 a sign that you have prepared them for the world \u2013 the downsides are often not adequately acknowledged. Parents are told dismissively to buck up, get a hobby or a cat and start seeing friends more \u2013 but \"empty nest syndrome\" can hard to cope with. A myth that surrounds empty nest syndrome is that it is only applicable to stay-at-home mothers, who have shaped their life around the nurturing of their children. In reality, it can affect any kind of parent, whether you have a separate career or not. Lillian Little says: \"I thought I would never suffer from empty nest syndrome \u2013 I'm a college professor with a PhD \u2013 I thought only pathetic women with no life beyond their kids had no problem with this.\" But Little was afflicted by a sense of \"life-altering loss\".Having a job outside of the house can provide structure and distraction, but by no means immunisation. Family Lives found that so many parents experience pain at an empty nest that they set up a specific advice line for the problem. Making a plan for the initial goodbye gives a framework and can be comforting. It's worth sorting out the practical aspects in advance. Are you going to drop them off in their new home, or are they getting there by themselves? How will you travel, where will you park, what public transport will you use? And once you're there, how long are you going to stay for? Resolving these issues well ahead of time means that on the day itself all the technical issues are sorted, and you \"only\" have the emotional aspect to cope with.", "label": "imagined", "group": "R2WKINV4"}

This included my friend's father, a Cameroonian uncle/preacher, and my friend herself. During her speech, she highlighted her relative's recent accomplishments including getting into pharmacy school and their own graduations. Then she started talking about me!

I kept playing, while trying to contact someone and maintain my composure. After what seemed like an hour, I finally was able to talk to my mom. She said that he had started having chest pains while at the doctor's office. They had left the room, and came back to find that he had passed out. An ambulance was called to rush him to the hospital. She said they were running tests, but things looked better now that he was checked into a room. I explained my situation, and said that I would be there as soon as I could. After we finished the round, we all drove back, and I jumped in my car and drove an hour to the hospital. He spent around 24 hours there, and after multiple tests, the doctors could find nothing wrong. He was just told to get some rest and see his primary care physician.

I couldnt figure out where the leak was coming from right away, but as the next storm came I started to hear dripping. I trace the dripping to the window where my AC unit plugged in. Sure enough the seal on the window was not very tight and the groove filled with water. This combined with the slightly downward angle of the unit caused a leak to happen. I took the unit out of the window and shut the window for the duration of the storm. Once the window unit was out I noticed that it was pretty dirty and had a bit of debris on the bottom helping the water to pool underneath. I removed the debris and wiped off the unit with a towel. I also placed a shim in place to get the angle more closer to 0 degrees to prevent leaking. I went upstairs to check the other units and they seemed fine. However once I turned on the upstairs one it started sputtering a bit of water. I took this one out of the window as well and turned it upside down onto a towel. There was a bit of loose droplets in there but i got most of them. As a precaution i placed a towel over it when i turned it back on to flick the remaining water into.

I took an Uber there to avoid any issues with parking and suggested that they do the same. I waited for them near a condo building that had benches outside of it. They arrived about 15 or 20 minutes after I got there. We greeted each other and talked about what we wanted to do first. I mentioned that I was pretty hungry and they said that they were too, so we walked over to the food trucks and started browsing the menus. Everything was expensive, so we settled on the cheapest food truck which had basic tacos and sodas. We all ordered our food and chatted about our days as we waited. When our food was ready, we found a nearby bench to sit on and started eating. The food wasn't great, but we were happy to fill our bellies with something. Once we were done eating, we decided to just take a walk to kill time until the fireworks started. The area had a lot of little shops and a park so we just window shopped and strolled through the park afterwards. We chatted and laughed about stuff while we walked and when it was about 10 minutes before the fireworks show, we started walking back to the clearing near the food trucks so that we could get a good view. There was nowhere to sit, so we just found a good spot to stand. The show was a little late and didn't start on time, but we were pretty patient. When it finally did start, the show was amazing. The fireworks were huge and colorful. Everybody clapped when it was over and my friends and I hugged and parted ways.

Things always escalated quickly when he was angry. He eventually revealed to me other behaviors like punching holes in the wall, throwing things, and constantly blame shifting everything to me.

He is 11 now and I feel its time for him to take up some chores. This will also allow him to grow closer to the dog.. as I did with my previous pet. Seeing the new puppy brought joy to my family and my son was ecstatic. Truth be told I really got a little sad and I thought about Nova, my previous dog. Nova was great dog and we were really close. The new Puppy will soon take over as the family pet, but I will never forget Nova. She definitely made my life more interesting and enjoyable. I am very much looking forward to this new challenge and I believe that the spirit of my old friend will be part of this new dog.", "label": "imagined", "group": "3CLJFVXJ"}

This company is bankrupt and owes something like $20 billion. Maybe they are being more proactive now in looking for leaks to avoid more lawsuits. But should I trust them? What option do I have? I'm no expert. July 15th was a long time to wait. Would I get blown up if Fourth Of July fireworks set off the gas? No, no, he assured me. This guy seemed to know what he was doing. Ok, I'll wait. The following week the little colored flags were planted to mark the gas lines, electric lines, phone lines, cable TV line, and water pipe, very colorful to match the American flags on Independence Day.

I've been out of the game for about 3 months now, and while I would never consider going back to it, I do like to reflect every now and then. It all started with a girl I had met in college. A woman, really. She was about 5 years older than me at the time, I 19, she 24. Before I had met her I had no interest in doing any kind of drugs. I was going to school for criminal justice and felt I could have a good future as a police officer. That dream ended when I started smoking. I just wanted her to think that I was cool (spoiler alert, she did not).I hadn't grown up doing a lot of bad things. I hadn't grown up being afraid or wary of the police. So when I drove into a motel parking lot to spark up a bowl (only about a block away from my residence, I had lived with my parents at the time, who were not cool with the MJ). When a cop pulled up to me with his lights on mid bowl hit, I was petrified. The only time I had been stopped by police was for a traffic ticket. Lo and behold, 2 random pills that I had never seen before or heard of in my life materialized in my center console, and I was taken in for possession of a controlled substance. I started selling marijuana to various peoples to pay off my gigantic attorney fee. Fast forward a little bit and I get arrested, again, for having an ounce of weed on me. Since I was driving at the time and the car smelled like weed, I was given a DWAI.

He talked to Veronica, who hung up the phone and told me something was going on and we were to meet him in the driveway. I put on my shoes, and followed her out to wait for him to arrive. After about 20 minutes, I heard what I thought was his motorcycle coming up the driveway. Sure enough, it was him. I was so concerned about what was going on I didn't even see what was happening right in front of my eyes. There he was, sitting on the bike right in front of me, grinning from ear to ear; It was MY bike!!! The one I had designed and was in the works for over 2 years!! I had no idea he had even been working on it and here it was, finished and in all its glory! It was gorgeous. Painting in black and my favorite shade of blue, lowered almost all the way to the ground, and sounding like a beast! Harley Davidson custom at it's finest! I was absolutely elated. Billy sat there with a shit-eating grin from one ear to the other, knowing he was a champion. He told me Happy Birthday, and that he loved me very much. He wanted me to have a very special birthday present this year because he wasn't going to be able to be here for my birthday, and felt terrible about it. I love this man! He is such a fantastic, loving, and supportive husband. To think he went out of his way to work so hard for weeks to get this project finished just to make me happy and see me smile. I am still very sad that he won't be here for my special day, but I have to admit he cushioned the blow a great deal with this fabulous surprise.

Throughout my pregnancy, butterflies would alight on me when I went for walks in the park. This had never happened to me before when I walked in the exact same park for years on end. After my grandmother passed, I would always see butterflies when I went to visit her gravesite, so I felt it was her spirit contacting me and letting me know she was around. My pregnancy was a bit of a difficult one, but I always knew it would be ok because my grandmother was near. I went into the hospital about four months ago and gave birth to a baby girl. It was a different delivery, and I didn't get to see the baby right away after she was born. The nurse who was caring for me assured me that my baby was doing just fine and looked like a \"Sophie\" in her opinion. Sophie was my grandmother's name, and it was the name I had planned on giving the baby in her honor. I felt overwhelmed with emotion. Right then I knew that my grandmother was with me again. How could the nurse suggest the exact same name? I hadn't told anyone there, nor had my husband. When I finally got to see my little girl, I saw my grandmother in her eyes. If I did believe in reincarnation, I would surely say that my grandmother's spirit is with my daughter.

I could not believe that I spent the last five years of my life working towards this day. During my time in university, I met many people of different backgrounds. Because of this I learned about many different cultures and became more culturally enriched myself. What makes this significant is the path it led me on today. Thanks to the many great people I collaborated with during university, I received an opportunity to work for a great company that embraces and supports diversity. The day of graduation is one that I still remember as if it was just yesterday. The feeling of accomplishment, but also some sadness still lingers on until this day. During my last year, I got realy close to some people which is unusual for me. Many of the people I interacted with during my schooling were what i would consider acquaintances. However, these people I met I could actually call my friends. The reason for my sadness is that I knew that once I graduated, I would most likely not keep in touch as mcuh as we did before. In the end, we all went to school for one reason, to get a nice paying job. We didn't really go to school to meet new people; at least that what it felt like. Anyways, the biggest thing I take away from this day is that all good things must have to come to an end at some point. I was counting down the days to graduation because I knew once it was over, that there would have to be a big change in my life; something I always feared. Most people would describe their graduation day with feelings of relief, happiness, and accomplishment. For me it was a bit different, almost the opposite. While the friends I made was probably the best part about going to school, would it even matter 5 years from now? Im glad that as of now everything seems to be going well and my work has paid off.

One day during the week my car was broken, I got a text from my brother, saying he was coming to visit me on Saturday to bring me something. My birthday had just passed and he lives in another city about an hour and a half away so I thought he was bringing my nephew to visit me since I don't get to see him much. My brother has never randomly visited me so I was excited that he was coming. Meanwhile, during that week, my dad reached out to me and offered to pay to have my car fixed. This meant a lot to me because my relationship with me parents has been strained lately and we hadn't spoken much. Saturday came around, and my brother text me to let me know that he and my dad were both headed to visit me. My dad had a flight out of the airport near me that day so they came into town early so that the three of us could eat lunch together. When they arrived to pick me up, my brother handed me a small gift, wrapped in Christmas wrapping paper with a bow on it, and told me I couldn't open it until he left. I agreed, and we all went to eat lunch together. Once we finished eating, my dad offered to let me drive his truck until my car got fixed since it would be parked at the airport all week anyway. I appreciated that he trusted me to drive his truck while he was gone. So, I had a vehicle to drive for the next week and headed home after work feeling very grateful. At home, I opened the gift my brother gave to me. It was a small box that belonged to my grandmother before she passed away, and he included $1000 in cash inside. I immediately started sobbing.

I was so filled with pride when I saw my son in his Army uniform standing in the airport. He looked so grown up, more so than one would expect after just the passing of several months.

Starting in the truck on the ride home, I was so full of questions and so eager to hear about my son's experiences. I needed reassurance, as a mom, that my son was doing all right and that the Army was treating him well and fairly. Seeing my son looking fit and happy did a lot to give me this reassurance and to dispel the worries that I had been feeling after hearing of problems my son had been having with certain people during Basic Training. At one point, it looked uncertain he would even successfully complete the training. But now, seeing him, I knew everything would be okay. As my son shared his stories, he could laugh about some of those experiences with the perspective gained by the passing of time.

I asked my mother and father if it was okay that I move in to the family house for a couple of weeks since the wife and I were in the process of buying our first home. I thought everything would be okay but my mom failed to return an answer to me that same day, in fact she never answered me about the question as a matter of fact. After this they both started acting weird with me, not returning my calls and just being very distant with me, it was awkward and frankly, it hurt me. I finally had the nerve to ask them what was wrong and why they did not include me. They did not have an answer for me instead they behaved as if nothing happened, it was disheartening and made me lose all hope. I gave up and went a few days without even thinking about them when my sister messaged me, she said she had something important to tell me. I immediately messaged her back and we agreed to have some coffee that same evening. We met up that day and my sister said she had some big news to tell me, which I was surprised to hear, even more surprised when she told me the reason my parents were distant these past few weeks. She said that all this time they had been lying to me about not being angry and in reality they were very mad at me. The reason? Apparently they could not fathom that I did not baptize my child under their Catholic customs, which is something I was always vehement about not believing, but they did not want to see it nor care until now when it was my daughter's turn to be baptized, they felt it was my duty as a born Catholic. I was enraged and I vowed never to speak to them again. I haven't since then, they have yet to call me or even send me a text.

It was my first time ever being to the nation's capital, and with one day before my husband's surgery, we attempted to walk all over downtown DC and see as many monuments as possible before we had to be back at Walter Reed and ready for surgery the next morning. We traveled downtown on the Metro, and ended up getting off a short distance from the Capital, where we started. We then saw the Washington Monument, Lincoln Memorial (my main reason for wanting to go downtown!), the World War 2 Memorial, the Korean Memorial, and Vietnam Memorial. We then took the metro back to Walter Reed, where we were staying on base for the next couple of weeks. Side note, I was really impressed by the strategic placing of water vendors throughout the different monuments, with water, Gatorade, popsicles, etc. I don't know if it's a good use of their life, but we really appreciated them being there! The thing that stood out to me about the monuments was the realization that the Lincoln Memorial literally just had Lincoln's statue in it. I seriously thought that there might be more, maybe a museum commemorating his achievements or something, but it really had just his statue. I might have been a little disappointed, but still impressed at the imposing presence Lincoln was, even if just carved in stone. What also stuck out to me while we were downtown was the World War 2 Memorial. I honestly didn't expect to be impressed by that memorial. But the different quotes placed around the structure really helped the memorial pop in my mind. I enjoy reading, and reading wisdom from those gone before us, who went through such a horrific time. So, I appreciated that monument more than I expected to. I'm really glad I was able to get the chance to see a small part of our Capital even though our reason for being there wasn't necessarily ideal.", "label": "recalled", "group": "QXZCED5L"}

I had an important meeting for work later on that afternoon, but did not have any other obligations until then. My parents had recently just divorced and my father had moved into his own little apartment in town. He was never the best at making meals for himself so I had started the habit of dropping him off some casseroles that I had prepared for him. I feared that he was lonely and heartbroken after my mother's infidelity. So, on that beautiful summer morning I decided that I would use my extra spare time to lend him a visit, and bring him some delicious lasagna that I had baked the night before. I drove there with the roof of my convertible down and the wind in my hair blasting some old favorite rock songs from days past. When I arrived to his residence, I saw that the cat was out on the porch. This struck me as unusual as my father had always been adamant that we watch the doors and not let our feline friends risk being run over by traffic. I picked fluffy up in my my arms and proceeded through the half opened door. I called out for my father with no response. I noticed a note on the counter that was addressed to me, it read: \"Honey, I love you, please do not go in the bedroom\". My heart started pounding out of my chest as I ran over to the bedroom. To my horror, I found my father laying on the floor, his head covered in blood with a revolver by his side. He had taken his own life and left me to find him. He had left me behind to face his horrific death. He felt as though life was no loner worth is for him, that I was no longer worth living for.

After I graduated college, we kind of sorta fell further apart.

It wasn't intentional in any way, but it just didnt feel like we were as close as we should have been considering we were family. That's kind of why I was a little surprised when she called me up one day to talk. I knew that she had been seeing this guy for a while now through facebook and whatnot.

We usually try to see each other at least three to four times a year due to the distance between us. My friend lives further north and I live further south in the United States.

Fall is always my favorite time of year and my friend really likes when it's cooler while visiting because they cannot stand the heat. So, it's the perfect time for us to get together and hang out and spend time together. Once my friend arrived, I went to pick them up from the airport and we drove to our hotel. Afterwards, we spent sometime in the room adjusting and getting our items unpacked. Then we decided we were hungry. We ordered our food and went to pick it up. We decided to go to a grill-like restaurant and pick up some hamburgers and fries. Afterwards we came back to the hotel and ate. The next day we went to a carnival for \"October\", which is my favorite time of year. So, we walked around together, just talking and enjoying each other and we played some games as well as rode the Spider, this one ride that looks like a space-ship and spins really fast, I don't know what it is called.

I really just couldn't believe it, I'm always there for all of them on their birthdays even buying most of them gifts and they couldn't even remember or even shoot me a simple happy birthday, I was just truly crushed. I didn't stay for that long because I'm so annoyed so after about an hour I left, none of them ever remembering still! I started driving home, I drove around for a little while just really annoyed and kind of let down. I stopped and got a coffee and sat in the parking lot with my coffee alone, by the time I got home it was around 8 p.m.. I parked the car Got to the front step of my door  I started the fumble with my purse trying to find my keys. finally I found them and let myself in, first thing I noticed was It was kind of dark, I always leave a lamp on when I leave the house and this time it was off. All of a sudden Lights came on and everybody screamed surprised!!  there must have been about 30 people shove into my apartment, it was a surprise birthday party, and my best friend's didn't forget about my birthday. I was so surprised and so happy at the same time I hugged my girlfriends and made my way around the room to see who was there. it was such a good party, there were balloons and a cake and gifts, lots of gifts. they even had food and my favorite wine. it was a great night, we hung out and danced all night long. after all the guests left my best friend stayed and cleaned up the mess with me. I'm really glad that I never got mad but none of them remembered it was my birthday when I was at her apartment earlier in the day, I had no idea that they were planning all of this, she told me that they were planning it for the last month and I have no idea.  all in all it was a great birthday I could not have been happier. After that day I really learned to appreciate my friends more, no one has ever done anything like that for me. I guess I owe them on their birthdays!!", "label": "imagined", "group": "B6VS7ZMF"}

Photographs are picturesque images and views thatreally catch the interest of the photographer. For me to experience and admirephotography, it took me only one photographer to really appreciate the power ithas his name is Robert Capa. Robert grew up in Hungary he experienced thepolitical unrest and turmoil. He lived under the oppression of Horthy andknew the kind of anarchy that constitutes war(Images of War 8). His work also had a swift understanding and sympathy for the people who sufferfrom being caught in war. This type of suffering made it impossible for himto ignore the events which affected their lives(Images of War 9). Robert'sbelief on photography is \"If your pictures are not good enough, your not closeenough\"(Photographs Foreword).Robert's breakthrough in the field of photography came during the Spanish CivilWar. His most famous picture was a snapshot of a courageous man in the act offalling(Capa18). His own special talents and course of world happenings, ledhim into a role as a professional photographer of war(Images of War20). Toreally admire and understand Capa, you must have a fascination for dramatic andemotional pictures of war. There probably has been thousands who admire thework he does. Well you can include me in that group of thousands. Capa putsinto perspective in just one photograph, something my grandfather will neverforget. The Bombing of Pearl Harbor. The photograph that brings back thesememories is taken somewhere in Europe during World War II. I", "label": "recalled", "group": "A51ZSRZ2"}

I chose a dress that I thought would make me feel more at ease and we settled on a small dinner club in the area.  We met at the restaurant and ordered drinks.  I had a cosmo, he went for a beer.

I'm thrilled that it has gone well for them, I mean the reason they lost their other job was just bogus at least in my opinion. My friend is such a great person, they're a hard worker, they're reliable, and so friendly and cheerful. They didn't deserve the hardship at their last place of employment that they had to cope with and I just hope that this job lives up to everything they thought it would be. It all started three months before when they first got promoted to assistant manager, they were so proud. Suddenly they became ill, they noticed they were going to the bathroom more often with blood, and they just kept feeling weaker. By the end of the month they could barely eat, and they already lost too much weight for such a short period. I remember that they thought they were headed for their death bed that they felt that badly. But they just kept pushing longer hours, more responsibility because after all they had just been freshly promoted. By the end of the month the last day they worked before they finally got a two day weekend they couldn't stand for more then ten minutes at a time without sitting down and their thigh muscles were just burning as they described later on. So after managing to last until the end of the day just barely they decided to go to the ER and when they got there they were told that they just had a bad case of colitis and were given some tyelnol with codine and sent home. Come Monday they called out because they were just in so much pain and felt so horrible. In the middle of the week it finally came to head and they went back to the ER because they just couldn't go to the bathroom anymore. They were admitted and went through a month of hell trying to recover. When they finally got out they were told to not go back to work so they told their job they wouldn't be there for another month per doctors instructions. So after that month passed they finally decided to go back to work and when they got there the people they worked with seemed less than thrilled that they were back. After a week they were called into the back office and told they were being demoted because management didn't feel that they could keep up anymore. Then came the big office theft and they all pointed the finger at my friend even though they had a perfect alibi. When they had nothing else to go on they started messing with my friends schedule and hours to the point that they left them with one or two days a week. It got to the point to where my friend just quit because for whatever reason they turned my friend in to a scapegoat and it wasn't fair in the least so this diary is why I am so glad my friend has been given the chance for a new beginning they deserve it after everything they have been through and what they went through no one deserves but you understand that don't you my papery friend.", "label": "imagined", "group": "9S2BIDXJ"}

In Vietnam, if you want to get from one side of the street to another, you just walk with confidence and predictability and the motorbikes will just move around you. Traffic in Saigon is madness. So many people, so many motorbikes, so many cars. And rules I didn't read up on. I bought a motorbike. It was a 125cc underbone scooter. Getting out of Saigon sucked.

So after just a week of discussions, we contacted a realtor and put our house on the market.  Not even 12 hours on the market, we received an offer on our house. We instantly knew that that was the sign we needed to go on with our plan. We were moving into an RV and traveling. Well, traveling as soon as baby #2 was born. We went out and searched for our perfect RV and found our new home after many visits to the RV dealerships.  My husband insisted on it custom built so we had to wait 8 weeks for them to build it. The process of selling our house flew by and we were left homeless and RVless for a short time. It was well worth the wait.  We have now lived fulltime in an RV for 2 months and we are both so happy with our decision. I still can't believe how smooth and quickly we made this decision.

It's easy to remember because it's been six months since I finally decided throw caution to the wind and follow my dreams. I always wanted to be my own boss, answering only to myself, and not making a pittance just so someone else can be rewarded for my efforts. As I had planned, I quit my job and used the funds I had slowly saved over the years to buy my first home to spruce up and flip for all that easy money. Well, that was the plan at least. The reality shows, infomercials and seminars all make it out to be so much easier than it actually is. I should have known better, but I was just too excited for the life change I always dreamed of. To be fair, purchasing the first home was easy... too easy. I should have seen the warning flags, but nope, excitement clouded my judgement. The price was great and at first glance the home was in pretty good condition, but that was just a facade. There were so many problems hidden in the walls and beneath the floors; electrical issues, unfinished plumbing, poor insulation, rot in the floorboards. I should have hired an inspector before purchasing, but was worried it would be snapped up by some other conniving entrepreneur. I won't lie and say I took it all in stride; I didn't handle it very well at all first honestly. But, after longer than I'd like to admit, I realized the only path forward was to get to work on the home and try to save myself from this disaster. It's been a hard half year, but it's finally coming together. I had to get another job, take out some loans, and all my spare free time has been spent working on the home myself (at least the parts I didn't need to hire an outside contractor for), but we're finally coming up to the finish line. There's still some aesthetic touch ups left to do, and I'll probably spruce up the yard a bit more, but as soon as the inspector comes by and gives me the a-okay, this house will be going back on the market. Will I end up making a profit? That would be nice, but trying not to be overly optimistic for now. At the very least I know I'll be able to wipe out my newfound debt and recoup at least a good bit of my investment. Will I buy another home after I am free of this short nightmare? I don't know. I haven't given it too much though. I definitely have more experience now and that would help, and I definitely don't want to spend my life as an hourly wage slave, but the magic of the idea has worn off. I guess I'll just see how I feel once I no longer have this burden on my shoulders.", "label": "imagined", "group": "WILXGM1V"}

I bought the pipes at  special store. I needed 10 foot hard plastic pipes about 3.5 inch diameter. Needed a friend with a van to get them.  Then We proceeded to dig down about two feet down thru all kinds of junk rocks roots etc. First part was from a central point that water went into and then the difficult part came  I had to go under a sidewalk. Thought this would be easy but was impossible till my 82 year old neighbor came over with two massive crowbar pipes and the three of us actually took out that piece of sidewalk  It was very hard and heavy. Then the last 70 feet was a straight run. The town had made a connection point for me so all I needed was to connect the two after much digging . The connection needed a special joint so it was off to the store. All the while had to put up tape and stakes to prevent people from going there It looked horrible. Now all connections were made and needed to concrete over the connection in the starting point which again my neighbor helped. He was great and knew how to do everything including pitch which was important so then we made some adjustments and finally filled in all the stuff. All this work by my 82 year old was surprising because he acted like he was 40. Not possible to accomplish this without him .

The opportunity also involved moving south, which was one of our goals, as we were both born and raised in New England, and were tired of the cold winters. So we decided to proceed with the move from MA to FL, even though it involved me giving up a good paying job that I had been at for twelve plus years and we would be leaving all of our family and friends behind. We were in this venture together and were determined to make this move work in our favor. Having never moved far from home, I don't think either of us realized how much work and stress is involved in packing up your life and moving to another region of the county. I should also mention we had about one month from the time the offer was made to the date we were scheduled to move, and we were both working full-time right up until the day before we moved. It was a very emotional time for both of us, and stress was running high. As we set of on our road trip, we became excited to see what the future would hold for us. My husband was scheduled to start work a few days after we arrived, but our moving truck was delayed and didn't arrive until the day before he started. I did not have a job lined up, as I planned to take some time and get us settled before searching for a job. My husbands job was extremely stressful from the start. The team was understaffed and the property had a number of issues that needed to be resolved. His stress level ran extremely high and he was working 12-14 hour days, 7 days a week. Two months into this experience, we found it was time to make a decision regarding my husband staying on in this role. He'd spoken to supervisors a number of time regarding the issues he was facing at work and nothing seemed to be changing. He was loosing weight, not sleeping, not eating well, constantly working, and continuously worrying about work. After much discussion (some heated at times) and consultations with family/friends, we made the decision for him to resign from his position. We realized this would mean we were both now unemployed and homeless, which means moving back to stay with family in MA. The movers arrive in just over a week to bring us back to MA, so once again I am preparing the task of packing up our lives to move, with no idea what the future holds for us.", "label": "recalled", "group": "CY0VHUXG"}

We had recently gotten a new dog and my old dog and her go along just fine or that what we originally thought. However, on that day I heard growling and then a loud yelping noise. I pause my game and run down the stairs as fast as possible. My dogs got into a huge fight and one had the other one by the neck and was trying to kill her. I rushed over there and pulled them apart the best I could. The small dog had puncture wounds all over and had heavy bleeding. Thankfully my dad walked right in the door and took control of it. I knew how to solve the issue but was not ready to take control. He sprung into action telling me the things he would need to help my dog. I grabbed all of the supplies for him and he started washing and stitching my dog up. I was very lucky that he is a veterinarian and that he was able to save my dog.

This might be the goodbye the we all dreaded. On a beautiful Saturday I drove my uncle and my aunt to visit GW at the hospital. On the way there we bought him some flowers for the room. When we got there I could hardly recognize GW. He looked so thin and frail and his cheeks sunk in quite a bit. I felt so sad that some tears actually came out. GW was asleep so we asked a nurse to wake him. He was groggy but very happy to see us. Even though he was physically deteriorating I could see that his mind was as sharp as even and his sense of humor was still there. I stuck my hand out to shake his hand and he held mine for a long time like he didn't want to let go. His hand felt cold and weak. I got emotional again and almost cried again but I held it in. I didn't want GW to worry so I put on a brave face and smiled. Before we left I told GW to get better soon and we'll be waiting for him at home. For the rest of the day I felt a bit melancholy and down. Seeing GW like that reminded me of how fleeting and fragile life is and it scared me.", "label": "recalled", "group": "Z7TVHF28"}

I figure he just sees me as a little kid (I was a year younger than him) or a little sister and nothing will ever come out of it so I try to put my feelings aside.

It was over the course of about one-two weeks, where I could tell something was bothering him. I took Kisses to the veterinarian, and they did a check up and some x-rays. They came back to the room and let me know he had lung cancer, which appeared to be fairly advanced. I was in a state of shock. Kisses was always a strong, little cat and hadn't shown any signs of illness until the very end. I could tell he was slipping away and was in pain. I asked the vet if there were chemotherapy or radiation options. He looked at me with tears in his eyes (he has been my vet since the beginning) and told me it had spread. In other words, there wasn't much they could do for him. The part I dread about having a pet is in their last days. I opted to put him to sleep, so he wouldn't continue to be in pain.

It took forever for someone to see me, and I was worried because the pain continued. A nurse came in to see me, asked what my symptoms were, and then told me I would need to undergo some tests.

For the seven years prior we lived out in the country and loved our privacy. We had bonfires every fall, parties, and my kids had the woods to have adventures in. Now that we are in the city my 12 year old son has become noticeably depressed and withdrawn. He doesn't want to go outside or even come out of his room. At first I thought it might be the move, but that is not the issue.   Night before last I asked him to come in my room and have a talk. I asked what was going on with him. He sat there and began to sob and cry. Finally after a few minutes of me reassuring him that there was nothing to big or bad that we can't handle it together. What he told me completely blew my mind. He preceded to tell me about how he has always felt different and then said he felt like he was supposed to be born a girl. I tried not to let my jaw hit the floor. I asked him to elaborate and he said that he had felt that way for a long time but was afraid to say anything. He then told me that he would preferred to be called by a female version of his name and would like for us to refer to him by that name and by the pronoun she. I hugged her and told her we would do whatever we could to make her be comfortable and if that was calling her a different name or anything else that would make exploring this easier for her. Honestly it is one of the hardest things I have faced with any of my three children. I consider myself to be open-minded and progressive, but when it's your child, all of that goes out the window. I love all of my children and have always assured  them that there is nothing we can't face together. So now it's time for me to back that up with action.

Despite this, I resolved to be more ready to get my gun out in the future. I also decided to save up money for a longer range firearm in case preventive measures become necessary at some later date.

After about 2 or so hours, we left the brunch restaurant and went to a nearby bar. My brother and sister accompanied us. Some of my brothers friends came too. They were not at the brunch earlier because we did not have enough spots for all of them. At the bar, we spent quite more time drinking. There were some games we could play like basketball, cornhole, and jenga. We had a good time at the bar. After that, we went to another bar. We spent quite a lot of time out in the city.

There were problems in the water system of the building before. I took care of this problem myself because it was simple. then the electrical system began to fail and I don't understand the electricity business, so I gave the building owner notice, but he passed away. but the big problem broke out 3 months ago. In heavy rain, the roof of the house was very bad and the upper floor of the building became unusable. this was purely a structural problem of the house and as a tenant I had no fault of use. the situation again I gave notice to the landlord. at first he wanted to pass. but when I insisted he came and saw the problem in place. I had a really serious damage and, according to the contract, he had to pay compensation to me and get the roof repaired. he would have to pay a substantial amount for these expenses. he told me that, despite the contract between us, he would not pay anything, that if I wanted to sit, I had to accept the building like this, that the rent rate would increase very much due to the shopping mall to be opened soon, and that I was so stupid that I could almost know that I was sitting for free. the landlords in this neighborhood kept saying how positive the new shopping mall would be. but things did not go as expected by the landlords. The company that made the shopping center went bankrupt due to a serious loan debt. The shopping center construction unfinished passed to the lending bank. The bank did not want to continue to the shopping center construction. due to this event, the rental rates in the neighborhood decreased to lower amounts than before. What did my landlord do? albeit forced to repair the roof, he paid me compensation for my belongings. There was only one requirement to extend the duration of the contract for another 5 years. because he knew perfectly well that when I evacuated this house, maybe 1 or 3 years, he can't rent this place to anyone. How do I know? no one has been sitting in the building next to me for exactly 3 years, but the owner of that building has to pay dues for the site costs.", "label": "imagined", "group": "P04TLN17"}

Thanks to me now having full custody, I can move wherever I want, and place the children in any school I want. At the end of the year, we may decide to move in order for me to pursue better career options. Since getting full custody the kids have been great. My one son is doing really well in school, and behavior issues have stopped. The mother calls every once in a while, but unfortunately the kids are not all that interested in talking to her.

I really was crazy about him, but he wasn't that crazy about me. He ended up breaking up with me, but we stayed friends. We lost contact for many years but then got in touch again via social media when he added me on Facebook. We were both married to other people and of course neither of us were interested anyway. Still, I was happy he remembered me and felt quite touched that he wanted to reconnect. Ok that's the back story. Here's the hard part. In February of this year,he suddenly posted on Facebook that he hard a heart condition and he only had a few months, or even weeks left to live, as no doctor would agree to do the necessary surgery. His heart was in really bad condition, he said, due to his previous drug addiction. I was stunned, and I messaged him about it. He said he was searching for a new surgeon who would agree to take on the risk. I even sent him a packet of Padre Pio's healing oil that I had, but a month or so later, he asked me if I had ever sent it, meaning he never got it. I'm not sure what happened. I thought maybe his wife took the package since it was from a woman, but that's just my guess as it is something I would have done. I found myself feeling really sad and thinking about him a lot, and contacted him often to see how he was doing. By March, he had found a doctor willing to do the surgery. After the surgery he wasn't online for awhile so I kept checking his page for any sign of that he was ok. Finally I messaged him, an he said the surgery went well but he was still afraid he was going to die. As for me, I knew he'd be fine. A few months passed, and I didn't hear from him. Just yesterday I went on his facebook page to message him and see how he was doing, and I saw that the page has been turned into a remembrance page. He died just months after the last time we talked.

My mom told me that bath time was always my favorite time because I would swim around in the bathtub and that's why she decided to put me into swimming. I was 8 years old when I had my first swim meet and I can remember it clear as day even though it happened over a decade ago. I remember diving into the pool and swimming as fast as I could and even taking peeks at the lanes on either side of me to see how I was doing overall. When I touched the wall at the end I thought I had lost and the first thing I told my mother when I got out of the pool was that I sucked. My coach reassured me that I was better than I thought and shortly thereafter I was bumped up into the bigger pool where all the 'big kids' practiced. I would go on to swim for this team for 10 years during the summer. When I started my freshman year of high school I tried out for my high school swim team and made it and then around the same time I joined a club team so I was swimming pretty much the entire year with not many breaks in between. When I was a senior in high school I was given the opportunity to go to schools on a scholarship for swimming but I decided to go to a school that I really wanted to go to even though they hadn't offered me a scholarship, but I was allowed to try out as a walk-on. When I started my freshman year of college, however, I changed my mind. I just felt like I couldn't do another four years and I really needed a break and I didn't want my college experience to be consumed by swimming so decided not to try out for the team. It was a really hard decision and I felt guilty. It was eating away at my subconscious and I would always have nightmares and I felt like I was punishing myself. It took a long time but I finally got the courage to get back in the water.

I didn't feel like showing up to work anymore, period! Later that day when I went home, I already began debating my future there. I knew my manager had treated other employees that way, but I just never thought it'd happen to me, since I always tried to be the best employee I could be.

I went up for a lay up with my right hand to fake my opponent, then tried to finish with my left. During the shot I had to adjust my body in a weird angle in the air so that I wouldn't get my shot blocked. Because of this I came down really hard on my right knee. I don't know if it was the angle I landed on or what but I felt a huge strain in my knee as soon as I landed. I sat at the rest of the game and had to walk with a limp for the rest of the day.

My reaction times were decent but they definitely weren't where I needed them to be for race day. We had a small engine issue pop up but nothing major and it was fixed in a short amount of time. My family enjoyed being able to see some of the racing greats that were there and my kid's really like getting autographs from them and getting to take pictures with them.

I'll tell you the story of the 2nd accident in brief \"We got off the highway and entered a country road leading to our summer house.

We were expected to before the bridge, but my brother didn't notice the warning sign since it was hidden by a tree. We had to give way to a big truck coming from the opposite direction but didn't due my brother's failure to notice the sign. When we saw the truck approaching us, we abruptly slammed on the brakes and my brother turned the steering to the right thinking was a lane there, but actually that was the lane for traffic in the opposite direction and as a result our car hit the sidewalk right under the bridge and it stopped after the collision. Luckily we didn't collide head-on with the truck. The right tyre burst, the rim was dented, but the biggest problem was the front steering column, which broke into two parts. However, there was a car service centre right near the place of our accident and they helped us repair the car so that we could drive home\".", "label": "recalled", "group": "HQYSXFZ5"}

There was just something missing in my life. We found a church home years ago, but I would go on Sundays and be quite aloof to the teachings. But one day in February, I hit a emotional wall with my self satisfaction, judgment on myself, my parenting, my friendships, my health. That was when I prayed to the Lord to open my heart and my mind, and he did. I even could hear from the Holy Spirit occasionally. I no longer spend my days and nights with alcohol, I have been sober now for six months. When you explain this to someone who's not a Believer they probably think I'm crazy.

Once I got there and saw the puddle of liquid on the floor around her I knew she was having the baby. She didn't want to call an ambulance because they would take her to the closest hospital, not the one she wanted to go to. I had no choice but to drive her. This was her third child and the doctors had predicted that once she went into labor she would deliver very quickly, so I was terrified she was going to deliver my niece in my car. The 45 minute drive to the hospital was the most nerve wracking experience of my life. I can't even explain how much I was shaking and praying. I was praying we made it, I was praying I wouldn't have to deliver a baby on the side of the road. For as much as I was freaking out my sister in law was surprisingly calm. She focused on her breathing and didn't talk much. I could tell as we approached the hospital that the pain was starting to be too much for her. I pulled up outside of the hospital and she jumped out and ran into the emergency room. I parked the car and ran inside after her.

This is a big step for me because she will be going to college soon. She has always been an independent child and I care for her a great deal. It is hard for me to see her go to this camp, but ultimately it will be good for us. I will hate to see her leave to college in two years but I will love the fact that she is starting her life. This is a significant step for us and I see it as a milestone.  I was so surprised to see her grow up so fast. Life goes by quickly when you are raising a child. She has been a joy to bring up and I am so proud of her. I cannot wait to see her aspirations and dreams come true for her. She works hard and is committed to her goals.

It spun us around into the median and was completely terrifying.  It really came out of nowhere and gave me no time to react or take any preventative measures.  We both looked at each other shocked when we came to a stop.  We checked on each other to make sure we were both okay, which we were.  We got out of my car to assess the damage and make sure the other driver was okay.  They other driver got out of their car and were obviously under the influence.  You could see the wobble in them from 20 feet away.  My car, which was pretty new, was smashed in the rear driver side, but not as bad as I would have thought.  The other driver looked to be in his mid 20s and started to freak out a bit when he realized that we were calling the police.  The police go there really quickly and gave the guy a field sobriety test which he failed miserably.  I exchanged information with on of the officers while we waited for a tow truck to come.  The other driver was arrested and my car was towed away.  It is the only major accident I've ever been in besides one or two small fender benders in parking lots.  Surprisingly, my car was mostly okay.  It's a 2012 Subaru Legacy that I spent a lot of time saving up for.  I'm not entirely sure what happened to the other driver, but his insurance settled out with us.  Ironically, my car was salvaged out about a month later due to hail damage (somehow that was more costly than this accident).", "label": "recalled", "group": "9VX0V6TF"}

Having a child and adopting one and caring and loving him as if he was my own. Caring and loving him as much as I love and care for my own child, and to be honest I couldn't get myself to answer the question. I was dealing with depression, feeling alone and left out so I decided to leave this question to answer another day. This was 10 years ago. I have told my girlfriend this story before and about five months ago, she surprised me with taking about wanting to adopt a child. This honestly brought me to tears and to be honest at this point in time, I have never loved her more. We have had some rough patches between us in the past but I think that has all settled now. This is not an easy decision, infact its nerve wracking but I hope we will get through with it. This was five months ago and we are now going through the process of adopting a child.

All traffic slowed and all of a sudden a lot of people got out of their cars and rushed over to the Honda Civic.  Everyone that looked inside the car immediately looked up and had a white look on their face, like they had seen a ghost.  I assumed everyone knew that the man inside was going to die.  I assume he was mechanically decapitated from the impact as he was parked and the 4-runner was travelling faster than the speed limit as it was.  I heard screaming from behind me, a woman appeared from out of the bushes.  She was stunned, the walking dead, but she appeared to be ok.  My wife had her sit down and just then a State Trooper arrived.  I told him to go to the car.  He was mad at me for directing him but he did so.  He looked in the car and stood up, his face white.

I met my girlfriend in 2017, we had some mutual friends and became friends through them. We instantly hit it off and started a great friendship.

We have had a pretty incredible relationship, obviously not perfect but we always come out of situations on top, together. I knew that I wanted to marry her pretty early into our relationship, but I also knew it was something that I didn't want to rush into. She didn't want to rush into it either. We very much wanted to take our time getting to know one another and just enjoying our lives together. Earlier this year, I decided I wanted to propose on our two year anniversary, and I started getting things set up to do so. I picked out the ring with the help of her sister, who is her best friend, and got on with planning the proposal. I decided the most important place to us would be the perfect place to propose, and that's at a local park where we shared our first kiss. In order to ensure that she didn't suspect anything, I had her sister suggest to her that we go on a double picnic date in that park with her and her husband before we went for our anniversary dinner alone later that night. We would then take some photos together as a group and just the two of us. Since she believed it was her sister's idea, my girlfriend suspected absolutely nothing. When it came time, my girlfriend's sister suggested that my girlfriend and I pose for a couples photo, and as we were stood next to each other, I stepped back, got down on one knee and proposed. She was shocked and overjoyed, and after realizing what was happening, jumped into my arms and said yes.

However, when I reached the location of the party, I came to realize that it was more of a surprise party for them, and all of my aunts and uncles had traveled to attend! I was shocked to see so many family members there, and they were all excited to see me. With the festivities commenced, I went to go talk to some of my cousins that had all traveled a decent distance to be there. I learned that one of my cousins was going to move closer to my grandparents since they needed more immediate help (my grandpa was struggling with Alzheimer's).  He told me that my grandparents had shown lots of signs of needing help and offered to be a help when a family council was called with all my aunts and uncles. That was definitely a surprisingly development! The party itself was great and well planned. There was a slideshow to help everyone remember all the awesome moments of my grandparents lives and what they had done for the world. They showed that my grandpa used to serve in the marines and would have to leave for long stretches of time to fulfill those assignments. Most surprisingly, they had a scavenger hunt prepared that had some of the littler children go around the house and \"discover\" hidden clues that revealed more about my grandparent's lives. They were thrilled to participate and added to the fun of the party. After all was said and done, the family did a great job of preparing the party and showing my grandparents that they care. There was a lot of work that needed to get done with their advancing age, but it was great to participate and see so many familiar faces.", "label": "recalled", "group": "YJ50DCXF"}

We have been going to the same place for twenty years with the exception of two years. The truth is for a couple of years I have been trying to back out of it and do something on my own with my vacation time but my mom can do one hell of a passive aggressive guilt trip to get me to go. My parent will ask me and my siblings what we want to do new this year at the destination but the truth is as far as activities go we've gone scorched earth over this place. Anyway, My dad and older sister normally have the trip scheduled down to the minute, leaving no room for anybody else to have much input. I am a little ashamed to admit for the past few years I've spent most of my time in varying degrees of drunken stupor as my main form of entertainment.  I had thought this might be the year that the cycle would break but my sister, who definitely drives the engine in this scenario, came up with a scenario to take my brother's children along this year. I have to admit, this was not her worst idea. My brother had moved to a different city and these children had never been to the destination before and would definitely shake up the routine. So, that was what happened a couple of month's ago my brother brought his children to town and we packed them into the cars a few days later for the trip. The car ride down was mostly unmemorable except for the fact that I realized that my spotify  playlists were not really kid friendly. The trip itself was a lot of the same things as before but there was a new energy because it was it was new to the children and it was exciting for them to go someplace that they had never been before. Things that had been stale were given new life and people were forced to change up some of their routines. Doing things that had become pedestrian and had lost their luster became fun again as I watched my nieces do them and remembered how I used to love to do these things when I was younger. For some reason I was dominating games that required coordination. Actually, one of the biggest problems was as the week progressed was that time was becoming compressed and there was so much to do. These kids had heard about the different things, those of us who had been coming for years had done, and wanted to do it all. Our last night there we were doing things until one in the morning. The next morning when we left was the first time in a couple years I had felt the least bit sad to be leaving. It was a long drive home I think most people were a little frayed but it had been a good trip.", "label": "recalled", "group": "UOKBY9P9"}

This party was taking place in a brand new home that was built in a very small and close-knit town.  As the night went on the party started to wind down and almost everyone had left.  Pat was going to find our friend in the backyard to say goodbye and I went inside to find our other friend to thank her and say goodnight, but she was already asleep upstairs so I went back outside and headed towards my car.  On my way down the dark driveway I was surprised to see a person pace down in the gravel. I got our my phone to use the flashlight and discovered it was Pat, and he was injured badly.  His head had a huge gash and he was bleeding and not very responsive.  I called 911 and gave the dispatcher all of the information I could, but I did not know the address, nor was I familiar with the town or any landmarks.  It took a long time for the paramedics to arrive, and when they started to treat Pat I was approached by 4 sheriffs who wanted to ask me questions.  I tried to give them as much information as I could, but since I was inside when the incident happened I really had no idea how Pat ended up in the state he was in.  Soon, the sheriffs started accusing me of assaulting Pat.  They questioned the homeowners who could not provide any information because one was asleep, and the other was at the far back side of their property cleaning up and putting out the fire we had going earlier.  Nobody heard or saw a thing.  So the natural conclusion for the officers was that I had a baseball bat and bashed in Pats face in the dark driveway.  I was treated like a criminal, and was not able to go with Pat to the hospital or even know what hospital they were taking him to.  Finally, with no evidence or baseball bat weapon to be found, the sheriffs let me go with a stern warning that the case was not closed and they would be watching me closely.  I found what hospital Pat was in, was able to speak to him after treatment, and found out that he had tripped on a tree root in the dark on his way to find our friend and hit his head on a rock.  The doctors and nurses even showed my the bits of gravel they had to dig out of his head.  From that night forward, and even still to this day, the sheriffs drive by my house continuously, often parking nearby and watching me as I go about my day.  It has affected me in a terrible way to be accused of something so awful and to made to feel I could be arrested at any time because of a made up theory that somebody decided must be true of me.", "label": "recalled", "group": "35N3KIG4"}

I've always had a desire to help others and after discussion with my wife, I decided to pursue a career as a firefighter. In our city, the process to become a firefighter is lengthy and demanding; it can take up up to three years and begins with the basics: an application process which began in June 2018 and ended in August 2018, and a test taking procedure which took place in December 2018. As summer of this year drew closer, I was doubting that I would be accepted further along, but finally, in early May 2019, I was invited to take part in the next step: the Candidate Physical Ability Test (CPAT). Over the period of May 2019 to August 2019 I would be given the opportunity to take the CPAT and if failed, I could take a practice test, then repeat the test. In total, there would be three attempts at the test and two practices, as needed. I thought I would pass on the first try given my physical capabilities, but I was sorely mistaken. I could not proceed past the first event on the initial test. I went to the first practice in June which was more of a walk through, but at least got to see and feel out the other seven events. Three weeks later, towards the end of June, I had my second attempt at the test. I made it further, getting through seven of the eight events, but failed to finish in time.  I would have to wait six weeks to take my final attempt. Halfway through we were given our second and final practice. This practice, they let us do a full run-through. I made it to the final event, but could not complete it; only needing about 10 seconds of work to finish. Over the next three weeks leading to my final true test, I felt deflated. I told myself maybe I just wasn't prepared. \"There was always two years from now\", I would think. I went into the final test still feeling a lot of uncertainty, but I prepared myself by thinking of my future and my families future. This was it; it was now or never (or at least now or two years from now). I buckled down and pushed through; finishing the course with 38 seconds to spare. It was a small window, but a pass was a pass. I was extremely emotional after passing; screaming with joy and calling my wife right away.

I've been out in San Francisco a lot lately to help take care of my 97 year-old grandmother. She lives with my aunt, but she's needed a little extra support lately. Anyways, I had been out there for over a month and was really missing my friends back in Colorado. I had made a joke to my friend Dani that we should rent an RV and drive the Pacific Coast Highway (PCH). There was some other family coming to my aunt's house who I really didn't want to see. Out of the blue, Dani called me about a week before the relatives were flying in. She declared that she had some cancellations and wanted to fly out and do the road trip. She booked her ticket that day. Once she flew in, we picked up the rental van (an actual RV was too expensive to be practical) and we were off! We started in San Francisco with a quick driving tour of the city, then we hit the PCH. We stopped at funky tourist attractions along the way like the Mystery Spot and a tiny Big Foot museum. We didn't plan anything; instead we just found places to stay as we went. If we liked the town, we stayed the night, if not we went to the next one. There were gorgeous views all along the rocky coastline. We took 2 days to drive down to Los Angeles and then we took 2 days to drive back to San Fran. I really enjoyed out time together and appreciated that she was able to come out. Plus the drive was a first for both of us which made it even more special.", "label": "recalled", "group": "U29RMYU7"}

I was feel kind of low due to not seeing many of my friends anymore due to everyone being busy with their own schedule, and work being a little slow was also on my mind. I may have been feeling sorry for myself, but the wounds were real. As I watered the cacti by the chain link fence I noticed a humming bird. At first I thought he was just doing his early morning pollen rituals, but to my surprise he wanted water. The thing is he did not want water to drink he wanted to get wet by the mist of the garden hose. I turned down the pressure of the hose to a fine mist and pointed the mist into the direction of the humming bird . The bird loved it he stayed stationary in the water stream for a long time. If I moved the hose a little he would follow to stay in the stream. It was great the bird had no fear of animosity of a human. He knew there was a human controlling the hose and he did not care he wanted water on this warm summer day. I felt great, I felt a connection with this little bird, we at this brief aquatic encounter were friends. It seemed that God saw my loneliness and sent me a friend. That small communal moment with nature make me feel better for the rest of the day. I started to realize that day can friends come in all shapes and sizes.", "label": "recalled", "group": "SDB613D4"}

Throughout all of the hard work and effort, I knew that there would come a time when I would finally be able to have some sort of payoff and be able to enjoy the fruits of my labors, if indirectly. I have always enjoyed spring break and have had a great time, when I could actually take my mind of of coursework and appreciate it for what it was. However, nothing compares to the fantastic concert I attended two months ago, after classes had wrapped up. Me and several of my friends pooled our money together to make it to a music festival that was taking place on a Caribbean island, not far off the coast of Florida. It was simply an incredible time, one of the best memories of my entire life. The quality of the light when you are closer to the equator is just sublime, and the thing that sticks in my mind more than anything else is the sight of the sunrise and sunset during those few days we were there. It felt like stepping into a new world, and I had actually never been anywhere like that even on vacation with my family as a kid. The actual music festival was of course very special, but most of our time was spent on other things. We stayed at a rented place that we pooled our money together for, and it was not all that expensive since there were a few of us in each room. The fishing trip we went on on the second day of our visit was probably the most activity I got the entire time. I didn't feel like working up much of a sweat when I was already soaked in it just the moment I stepped out the front door of our accommodations. The climax of the music festival was something that made me feel like I had goosebumps. One of my favorite electronic musicians was performing and the view of the sunset over the beach as the music built up was just otherworldly. It was not something that I would soon forget, and I think that there will probably be few chances to ever have an experience like this again in the future. One thing I can say is that I met a couple who were very interesting, and we exchanged contact details. So there is a significant chance we may do something together in the future, which is exciting.

He had full-on delusions and wanted to argue you with me over scientific principles that were non-existent.  He claimed that all plants have psychedelic properties and that he could make DMT out of the mimosa trees that grow near our house.  I found him passed out at the base of a poor tree that had been hacked halfway out of the ground with a garden trowel.  He seems to be doing better and has gotten into an outpatient treatment program in the last week.   I fear he has some psychological issues that need medication, but I dare not say anything about it to him.  Luckily, I work from home and can monitor him while he's here.  I moved after his arrest to a more rural area to avoid the drug culture that our old neighborhood was immersed in.  As for myself, I have no desire to use drugs, other than maybe some pot now and then to relax.  I feel like there are so many other people that suffer from addiction and there are no real resources to help them, save meetings and for-profit rehabs.

I was heading to the movies with a friend who had been begging me to go see it for days, although now I can't even fully recall which it was. There wasn't a lot of time for me to think as I was still groggy, so I quickly went back inside to grab a cup of coffee before heading out. Turning on the machine and hearing it whirr to start up I decided that I would also flick on the television real fast just to see what was going on in the world. I honestly can't remember what I saw, as my mind is blurry from the entire thing but I do remember it being quite boring to the point of remarkability, but what did stick out was the traffic alert.

At this point you can probably realize this isn't exactly just a friend, but someone who I had wanted to impress and so when I returned and showed her the blu-ray we watched it together and it was a pretty awesome experience. The entire time all I could think was about how lucky I was to be in this house with her and her family, who seemed to be pretty receptive of me.

Henry got on the big yellow school bus for the first time ever and headed off to his very first day of Kindergarten. As I watched him go, I felt a weird mixture of feelings, one of which was relief. Relief??? I'm not supposed to feel relief!!! I'm supposed to be heartbroken and nostalgic, thinking how different things will be without him around the house. Looking at his little un-played-with toys. Missing his voice and constant questions. Thumbing through old photo albums and marveling at how it was practically just yesterday that he was taking his first steps and saying his first words.

Taking advantage of less heat, my unruly neighbor decided to take up her woodworking activity on her apartment balcony again. Her balcony is situated next to my room desk and across from my front door where I work on my laptop. She moved in next door while still employed by the property. She began causing a ruckus by cursing, at her incredibly hyperactive child as well as her older stepchildren, as she banged, hammered, etc for months on end. It was taken in stride under the impression that she was working on remodeling the apartment in lieu of the usual maintenance crew. She eventually stopped when the summer heat became unbearable but still let her child screech, scream and climb all over the place while she looked at her phone in the evenings. She'd yell at him every 20 seconds or so instead of paying attention to him or taking him to the park across the street. When walking past her, she would ignore anyone coming across her. The noise was intolerable as she started up again. This time, she used heavy machinery from early morning into the evening. Her kid would just screech at the top of his lungs next to her. I started recording her extraordinary noise in audio files and video . I also began taking images of her woodpile, hidden from public view, but clearly visible from my front door. I messaged the property manager about her proximity and balcony violations but got no response. I called the front desk and they said the manager wasn't in. They said they couldn't do anything because they didn't have authority. Following day, same attempts and replies but nothing... third day, trying to get management to stop her, nothing. Eventually while she worked all day again, some other neighbor confronted her and she stopped... until he left, then started again.

I wasn't worried at all, because, well it was my fourth child, I had given birth three times before and the process had always been easy, quick and pain free, thanks to an epidural. This time around, my plans were the same. I should have known this time would have been different, should have recognized the signs when things started off downhill, after all, it took them seven different sticks and an emergency response team to get my IV in. Around 5 a.m. on the 18th, I wasn't having any bad pain, just a few contractions here and there, nothing consistent. I had not been checked for dialation since midnight, but the pain was increasing, just a little, so I decided to go ahead and get the epidural so I could get some rest, afterall, they hadn't broke my water yet. The anesthesiologist came in a few moments later and began the process. Let's just say that this didn't go as planned either. So here I am, sitting on the edge of the bed, hunched over so he can tap my spine correctly. Well, he misses- FIVE times. Five! No joke, he used six different kits. About 45 minutes into the process, something isn't right. All of a sudden my contractions had sped up, coming in around 30 seconds apart when they had been several minutes apart before. My pain increased exponentially, I was in excruciating pain, still being forced to hunch over and hug my knees because he couldn't get the \"right spot\", meanwhile, the efforts he was making were hitting nerves left and right, send fire and twitches down my right side. During this time, I am screaming, telling the nurse I need to push. She assures me that my water has not broke yet and it's not time to push, the epidural is nearly done. I knew something wasn't right, I pushed the anesthesiologist out of the way just as he started taping the needle down, saying we were good to go. Sure enough, as soon as  I laid down the nurse informed me that the baby was crowning, while another nurse called in an emergency response team (there were no ob's available). Ten minutes later, I had a perfect little baby girl in my arms, but OH MY GOSH, the pain! Unbelievable.

Something came over me--I had a feeling of going into autopilot when I saw a man about my age beeline out of the truck to scramble for the debris that had fallen. I biked across the street with the intention of helping him lift the materials back onto his truck. He was overtly grateful to me, and asked that I come to his office later to get compensation for my act. I was hesitant, but he insisted. When I visited his office later, it turned out he was a CEO for a tech startup, and was working on building an app with investor capital. I let him know I was a computer science major, was interested in building an app, and was dissatisfied with my current office job at a call center for an online private education institution. I'd taken a break from school to work at that call center. The environment was very hostile, the office politics brutal, and the work expectations for the expected wages inequitable. In addition I don't have my driver's license yet so I had to bike or take a city bus to get to work--affording relying on Uber/Lyft was out of the question because I sent any part of my paycheck to my mother who was suffering from Crohn's disease and homeless in an extended-stay motel. So I was desperate to find a less hellish opportunity. He convinced me that I'd be a valuable asset to the project, and talked about equity for the app if it was successful. I had no experience with this kind of stuff, but I decided to go for it. I eventually transitioned from working my office job to working for him. I spent the next 4 months building the UI for his app along with 5 interns. I witnessed shocking things I never had seen before with regards to human greed and corporate backstabbing in the software development field. The app didn't get finished, and without warning I was laid off because all of the investors had pulled out. Right before Christmas 2018. I was devastated, and found out the CEO ended up dissolving his company, declared bankruptcy, got divorced, sold all his possessions, and ended up institutionalized. I went through a dark period myself, but with the help of my best friend and my mom (my only family), I gained online employment such that I can fully sustain myself (with a roommate), maintain a 401K, and have decided that I don't want to be a part of the 9-5 work environment if it's going to be so toxic.

I have been fortunate enough until now to not know the pain of losing family members--pets were very difficult, but expected. I had no idea how to handle what I was feeling. My great, great uncle-- in his 90s-- accidentally crushed his legs between a truck and his own car. Both of his legs were completely shattered. He was in the ICU for a week having multiple surgeries done to him. It brought up a lot of feelings that I wasn't expecting to have, especially torwards a man I hardly knew and disliked more than I liked. I found myself tempted to pray, despite being raised as an atheist. Things were looking okay once the surgery was done, though. He would have a long road to being better, but he'd live. Then, there was a blood clot and he had a massive stroke. It resulted in a coma. He didn't wake up for another week. I sat there and wondered if anybody would listen to my input, if we would let him go, if we would have to be there when he was unplugged. There was almost no chance of him waking up. Technically, since then, he has woken up. He hasn't opened his eyes or woken up yet. His brain is probably not there anymore. I don't know what could possibly happen that was good out of this. He won't ever be the person he was before. I never really got a chance to meet him. My great great uncle is so overcome with guilt that he will die soon, most likely--he's lost so much weight. His wife is in terrible condition as well. Most of my friends don't really understand why I've been so distant but I just want to be with my family lately.

We buried her in our backyard, made a nice place for her to rest in peace. She brought so much love and joy into our lives and was a special dog. She was stubborn and had a weakness for chicken and just made you smile when her whole body wiggled with joy. Saying goodbye is never easy. Watching her give a last few wiggles of her tail despite being so weak but letting you know she still heard you talking to her was both heartwarming and heartbreaking. I was there as she breathed her last. I sat with her for a while hating to say goodbye and not really ever ready to let her go, but knowing that it was time.

It really resented with me as a child because it was always in the presence of teachers and instead of doing anything about it, they laughed at him. It was some really early memories that I have of not feeling protected. As an adult, I know now that he was just a jokester and someone who loved pranks and joking around but as a kid, I saw it as torment and a bully. Nothing he did was even all that bad, just hiding and jump scaring everyone mostly. As an adult, it was the first time I had seen him in a long time and to be face to face with someone that I considered a bully growing up was so odd. Turns out, he was still joking around and kidding and being the same as I remembered him, but without the childlike thoughts of malice that I used to have. It really made an impact on me seeing him now with eyes that have grown and understood. I mentally forgave him for the pain he put me through as a kid.

As an adult, I better understood things and seeing him do the same things he did to me (jump scaring, saying he was eating a cat when it was a  regular burger, etc) seeing him do that to other kids, I see how it's harmless.

As an American, there is a pervasive stereotype that the French are all mean and rude and nasty. This couldn't be further from the truth. In fact, the vast majority of Parisians that I interacted with were wonderful people. I found that as long as you are respectful towards them, they treat you with just as much respect back. Another thing I noticed about French people was that they are much more open to you if you try and speak a little French. I think that this shows them that you are trying to learn their culture, rather than forcing them to speak English. After our trip to France, we flew to Italy. My experience there was very similar to my experience in France. The people were wonderful and much more kind than I was expecting. On the whole, this experience changed my outlook on life.

He was born with a condition called polydactylism, which means having extra fingers or toes. In my son's case, he was born with an extra pinky toe on his left foot. As a baby it was easier to manage, since babies obviously don't need shoes, but now as a preschooler his extra little toe would often hurt him while wearing tennis shoes. My husband and I always knew that he would need this surgery, but we were still worried when the day actually arrived. Neither he nor I, nor our older son, had ever needed surgery before. This was uncharted waters for us. When we arrived at the hospital Thursday morning, the nurses took his vitals to make sure he was healthy enough for surgery that day. Other than that, a lot of the time was just spent waiting. It made my husband and I feel sad because our son was hungry but he was not allowed to eat prior to the surgery. Thankfully the hospital did have a good amount of toys that helped keep him distracted. Finally around 12:30 in the afternoon he was taken back for his surgery. My husband and I were not allowed to go back with him, but the nurses and doctors made it fun for him by taking him back in a big push car. Once they got to the room, they put a small mask on his face with the strawberry scented gas he had picked out earlier. After he was asleep with the gas, they put the needle in his hand for the other anesthesia. Surgery only lasted about one hour. The nurse came to get my husband and I to take us to where our son was recovering. He's normally a really happy little guy, but unfortunately he was in a lot of pain and very confused coming out of his surgery. He ended up needing three shots of morphine in his IV to manage the discomfort. Thankfully it seemed to work quickly and soon we were on our way home.

All they wanted to do is cause terror and fight. We called the cops because my brother did get punched by one in the face and of course they broke the window. The cops took for ever to get here and when they did the thugs ran away. However the cops had the audacity to say it was our own problem. And the one who broke the window was right in front of the cop calling him a profanity and the cop did not even arrest him. This was very surprising the police officer knowing this was the thug who committed the crime did nothing and let him run away. The only thing that stopped these thugs from coming back and harassing us was going to their school and it all stopped.", "label": "retold", "group": "RKX7YBM6"}

I had recently gotten a significant promotion at work and we knew that with the economy being the way it was, it was as good a time as ever to make this move. Whenever we talked about our wishes for our future home, we always knew we wanted a view. There was some land being prepared for some new houses to be built on in our current neighborhood. The way it was set up, we knew that there would never be the ability to have new construction block the view of the lot we wanted to purchase, meaning we would always have the view we wanted. With the market being the way it is, our house sold quickly and we needed to move into temporary residence until the new home construction was completed. We chose to rent a duplex in our current neighborhood so that the kids school would not be affected. This was going to be an exciting adventure for them! We had secured all the loans and funding in addition to the money from the sale of our house to purchase the new home and were all set to get going on the build. There ended up being a very bad weather pattern that settled in our area for weeks. The land we wanted was on a pretty steep hill and as it turns out the water run off washed away a good part of the hill during this unusual weather pattern. We backed out of the deal and decided to keep looking for a different location to build. I had gone to work the next week and as it turns out my new position at work was offering me an opportunity to relocate with better pay! The new job was located in California, just 20 minutes away from Disneyland! We talked it over as a family and ultimately made the decision to start this new adventure over in a whole new place!

Once I was in the bathroom throwing up still holding on top the pain in my stomach I knew something was wrong. I knew I couldn't drive myself to the hospital and I didn't want to call an ambulance. I knew my dad leaves the city to head to work early in the day so I asked him to please pick me up and bring me to the emergency room. By this time it was about 6:30am in the morning. When I got to the emergency room they asked me a lot of questions mostly thinking it was gas or food poisoning. Once they saw how much pain I was in they gave me an IV with some pain medicine and told me I would be getting a Cat Scan done to see what was going on. The results from the cat scan were that my appendix was inflamed and was in danger of rupturing and needed to be removed immediately.  Within about 30 minutes of the cat scan results I was in the surgery room. It was very scary because I was all alone and given how sudden and fast paced everything was going I didn't have time to call anyone. Plus it was now about 9am in the morning and I knew anyone I called would be starting their work day. Rather than distributing anyone's work day I just under went the surgery alone without telling anyone. Once I awoke from surgery and everything was fine I called my dad and sister to let them know and ask that they go to my house for me and feed my cats. I had to stay overnight in the hospital to make sure I recovered ok.  I ended up being out of work for just about a week and was overall really lucky I went in when I did.

My husband's interests have deviated from mine.  We didn't seem to have anything in common anymore.  I would try to talk to him about my day, what I wanted to do in the future, and I grew to realize he just wasn't listening.

I did not expect it to be an eventful night or anything, I had just had a long day and wanted to go out for a drink. While I was at the local bar, my friend, the bartender, mixed up my drink order and later re-purposed that drink into a round of shots for him, myself, and another patron at the bar. My friend introduced me to the other patron and said that we would get along. After we took the shots, the other patron and I started a conversation and the conversation was light and cordial, but I really got along with the other patron. We got along so well in fact that we ended up staying until the bar closed that night talking. The conversation with the other patron was very easy and we quickly transitioned into talking about a variety of different topics including music, what we did, where we were from, and other topics, including what was around the area since he had just moved to the area. We did not exchange numbers or anything that night, but then I saw the same patron that Wednesday night, the third of July. When I saw him in the bar, I went over to him to say hi and we started off talking small talk again. Even though this was only the second time I had met him, we got along so well and the conversation was so easy that it felt like we had known one another for much longer. That night we ended up hanging out talking until the morning. That Friday, the fifth of July, we actually intentionally met up at the bar for drinks and ended up hanging out all night again too.

Soon, the 3rd person (Judy) arrived and we all had dinner together. There were a few awkward pauses, but for the post part, the trip went well and we all had a great time. We traveled around the Columbus area, went to a few different malls and went out for food and drinks. We all stayed in the same house and spent the evenings cooking together, watching movies and generally bonding and learning about each others lives and experiences. Overall, it was a very fun and memorable weekend. We are trying to plan another get together, but since we all live in different states and have busy lives, it is difficult to coordinate and time and place. I do hope that we can all get together again soon.", "label": "recalled", "group": "L6SGE96J"}

I lived in a small European country, Montenegro, for 30 years of my life. I was happy in Montenegro but I started feeling that I am unable to advance too much in my professional life. My main focus was to get hired for a big company where I can learn more about web design and building websites for the clients because I have a Bachelor degree in this field. So, I finally decided to move and live in the USA where my husband used to live for the last 10 years. My husband was so excited that he will not have to fly 2-3 times a year to Montenegro just to spend time with me. When I come to Michigan it was very cold and snowy. Nothing like beautiful Mediterranean weather I am used to. I felt some uncomfortableness around my heart and thought that I might never get used on this coldness. I took my laptop and checked which company are hiring web designers. So, in the next 2-3 days, I built my resume and I applied for 3 companies I found most attractive. One of them was MPH Marketing Solutions company and one week after the application they called me for the interview. I was so excited. My interview went very well and they hired me. They showed me the office and introduced me to other workers. It was a small size company, very clean and organized. Workers with different racial and cultural background were very welcoming and I felt positive about my start. On the other hand, I missed my family and friends a lot. I talked with them every day using Viber, Skype, FB messenger but it was not enough. I would dream of my hometown and when I would wake up I felt sad and lonely. I missed my father who was suffering from Alzheimer and I was afraid he will not recognize me when I go back visit. I tried to be busy all day just not to think. So, two days ago I booked an airplane ticket for me and my husband and this spring we will visit my hometown, Podgorica.

It was awful because the store was packed, the lines were long and there was no water left. There was hardly anything substanial at that point. After that, I went to the liqour store to buy some rum. The hurricane did not end up hitting us at all. It was a fluke and every one was panic and filling gas and spending money and we did not get hit. I am so grateful that we did not get hit but i am also so over whelmed thinking about the ordeal that was. Now, i still have food that remains from that weekend. Still in the cabinets, untouched.

Our discussions at the early stages were a bit friendly nothing intimate, but as days passed it got more intimate and romantic. We got to know our favorite colors, food, hobbies, future plans and basically everything about us. We never saw physically but emotionally we were very close to each other. Video calls helped a lot, in terms of reducing our tension, nervous nature and early shyness that happens in almost all relationships. After about a month, we decided to fix a date when we could see. We chose an nice restaurant to meet, which was not quite far from us both. Finally, we met and all I can say is, she was the most beautiful girl my eyes has ever seen. Never knew one could be so perfect, her smiles were genuine and flawless. There was just something about the way she carried herself, you could tell she was very confident in her skin. Our conversation never changed, it was as if we were old friends who just met after a long time. The attraction was there, none of us could even deny it; there and then, I told her my intentions.

I was carrying a jar of  pickles at the time, and when I fell, the jar broke and badly cut my hand and wrist.  I couldn't get the bleeding to stop, so I called an ambulance.  It was embarrassing to have to call them, but I was losing a lot of blood.  They put a tourniquet on it and took me to the emergency room which was less than 5 minutes.  The damage was pretty bad and the cuts were jagged so they had a lot of trouble getting it sewn together.  They used a lot of glue on top of the stitches as well.  It didn't hurt very much, but I wouldn't realize until the next day that that was a bad sign.  They wrapped the whole thing in a large bandage and I went home.  It wasn't for another hour or more before I realized I couldn't feel anything in my last two fingers.  I thought maybe the bandage was wrapped too tight and ignored it, but the next day I took some of the wrapping off and realized that I didn't have feeling in the fingers or that part of  my palm below them either.  I also couldn't spread my fingers or move them much.  I was still hoping a lot of this would heal, but I looked online and saw that I might have some permanent damage.  It was  depressing news, and I was pretty upset about possibly not being able to use the hand again, but since I don't have insurance, there wasn't much I could do except to hope that when the swelling came down some, it would improve.  Unfortunately, I found over the next week that the hand would never come back to the way it was before.  Fortunately it was my left hand and I was able to compensate for it pretty well, but there are some things I can't do and if people look at it closely, they could see that the two smaller fingers are permanently bent in a weird way.

I traveled there with my brother and a close friend and we spent the whole time relishing the change in scenery and culture. While staying there, I got in touch with a friend of mine on social media that had been my best friend throughout my entire youth. Through our back-and-forth chats, I discovered that she was visiting her sister in a small city rather near where we were staying. Immediately, we were both enthused about the possibility of reconnecting and didn't want to miss such a surprising opportunity. The vacation was nearing its end, but I decided to extend my stay there by five days since I didn't need to return to work for another week and I could spare the expenses. My brother and friend returned home on a flight the next day. The following day, we decided to meet at a local cafe. The cafe was a beautiful little countryside shop that was surrounded by some stunning scenery. I arrived first, but only had to wait for five minutes or so. We picked a table outside, which made for a very pleasant experience due to the lovely weather and tranquility. Somehow, despite having hardly spoken for eight years aside from a message or two, we reconnected so easily. Our conversation wasn't the least bit awkward or stilted even at the beginning and we fell back into a sort of easygoing, lighthearted rhythm remarkably naturally. After a small lunch, we spent the rest of the day traveling by train through the countryside. We talked and laughed and shared numerous stories about our lives over the years. Nothing felt difficult to talk about and the depth of our friendship seemed to have never left, as though it would be able to survive anything. We said goodbye to each other that night, but met up again two days afterward and spent the majority of my remaining time there together. Aside from the reformation of a wonderful friendship, the whole experience was one of the most transformative of my life. It reawakened my creativity and love of life to an extent that few other things ever had. It also emphasized the importance of maintaining my relationships throughout life.

Everything went very well, and the memory of that day will stay in my mind, and I'll cherish it for the rest of my life.  Besides our immediate family, I had my best friend come up from across the country to be my best man. I absolutely love him and his family, and cherish every moment we get to spend together. I don't get to see him too often, so when I do I take full advantage and try to enjoy every moment as much as possible.  Not only did he come with his daughter and wife, but his parents were there as well, as they are very important to me.  I was overwhelmed with the amount of people we had there, and probably felt as loved and important as I ever have in my life on account of all the people there. The only part that was a bit bothersome was with it being a wedding, and so many people, I didn't get much time to chat with each person, as I would have liked to. I've come to realize that's just how weddings are with so many people and only so much time, that it's part of the gig.

In my opinion there simply was no rush to have them taken down as they provided shelter for the wildlife. I had noticed many times with in the prior  weeks there were a number of squirrels using them as homes to secure their nest and the  red headed woodpeckers that would come by and have there morning feast of ants, termites ect...

My mother would hear no more about it and in fact she took it upon herself to secure the proper equipment. She called  the local rental store and secured not one but three chainsaw. Why three you ask? She was firm in her belief that I would do anything to prevent the squirrels from becoming homeless  even if that meant destroying property.  With much hesitation I went to the rental place picked up the chainsaws and went on my way. With much frustration I stopped by my buddies house and asked for a hand.

I was driving home from work and I was on a side street. I remember seeing a young boy run out of the front door of his home crying. I kept driving. I assumed his mother had kicked him out for drawing on the walls or something. I looked in my rearview mirror and I saw that the young boy was running out into the road waving his arms, maybe something was wrong? I decided I would just drive around the block on more time and see if he looked injured or anything. As I approached his house for the second time he nearly jumped on top of my car, I had no choice but to stop. He started screaming through his sobs something about his mother. I jumped out of the car and got him to calm down enough so that I could understand he said his mother was having a baby. I ran to the front door and could hear the mother screaming out in pain. I walked inside and there she was, his mother was sprawled out on the floor bleeding and screaming in pain. I called 911 and somehow they managed to get to her house before the baby was born or before she lost too much blood. Ever since that day I don't ignore my gut feelings because if I had that day who knows what would have happened. When I saw her today she looked great, and the baby is already getting so big.

About a year and ago I decided to change things and started losing weight and working out.  For the first time ever, I was very successful and stuck with it. Soon after I had started exercising, I decided I wanted to take up running. Now I'm someone who always HATED running. I could barely run ten feet, so this was quite a feat to accomplish. The next morning I headed outside and started a running app to help me train to run a 5k. This seemed like something I'd never be able to do. I started doing intervals of running and walking three times a week and it was HARD. I ran so slowly and felt like I was going to die, but I kept at it. As time went on, it got a little easier and I was able to run for longer distances. Soon I was able to run for a mile at a time, which was crazy to me. I kept going and going and I realized that I started to actually enjoy running. Instead of dreading it, I was looking forward to my time running. This was probably the biggest surprise of the whole story. I never imagined myself enjoying running. I ended up completing the program and signing myself up for the main event. A 5k race. I was very proud of myself for getting to this point. However, my proudest moment was running that 5k three months ago. I finished it with a decent time and everyone who knows me was extremely proud of that accomplishment. I now consider myself a runner.", "label": "recalled", "group": "0WORSRXE"}

I tried to tough it out for a few days but it was no use, I had to have it looked at. Getting in to see the doctor was the usual trouble, call to book an appointment, nothing open for a while but finally I did. After a brief examination the diagnosis was clear: I had a knee injury and would need surgery. After a few more doctor visits for examinations, meeting the surgeon, discussing the procedure, the day finally came for the surgery. I went in for knee surgery in January. After being admitted and put in a gown and bed, the last meeting with the doctors took place. At the end of it the anesthesiologist asked a series of questions just as final confirmation. \"Are you allergic to any medications?\" No I replied. \"Do you have sleep apnea or any breathing disorders.\" No I don't I said, thinking that I had already wrote this all in a questionnaire. \"Is there any possibility that you could be pregnant?\" No I am not pregnant I said. \"This is very important though, is there ANY possibility that you could be pregnant?\" Hmm I thought. I didn't feel pregnant, but then again I had never been before, how would I know? So I said \"yes, it's possible I suppose, what does that mean?\" I'll tell you what it means. It means that your knee surgery gets postponed while they administer a pregnancy test. It means they have to do a second test, and then a third one to confirm. It means I went for a simple surgery and instead found out I was 5 months pregnant. It turns out that they couldn't do the surgery when I was pregnant, the danger to the fetus was too great. My surgery was cancelled. After a closer examination of my knee they decided the problem with my knee could wait a few months for surgery, or may even resolve on its own with physiotherapy. But there was one complication of my knee problem that none of us ever expected: I gave birth to my son in May.", "label": "imagined", "group": "0REHHSWE"}

I told her to call and make a doctors appointment and I would drive her up there to get it checked out. During her appointment, the doctor explained the issue and said she would need a minor procedure and the routine surgery to be performed would have her feeling better in no time. We met with the surgeon and he helped calm our any fears we had about about the procedure and did a fantastic job reassuring us that we should have nothing to worry about, it is a very common procedure. The day of the surgery they wisk my wife away for this routine procedure. They explained it would take about an hour and I would be able to see her after. A couple hours had passed and I began to worry if everything was alright. I asked a nurse for an update and she went and got a doctor who explained that there were some complications. They had cut an artery and bundle of nerves by accident, so things did not go as planned. I was horrified. The recovery process was much more entailed than expected. During this recovery she gained an infection from a small instrument they forgot inside her leg. They explained they would have to operate once more and they did so quickly. She almost lost her leg. The recovery process has taken much longer than anyone could have guessed. She now walks with a limp and has pain that is occasionally worse than it was before the surgery and this will continue the rest of her life.

I had noticed the knee pain from time to time the last few months.  I initially chalked it up to the increase in my distance running since I was prepping for a half marathon.   I was starting to worry that I had a small tear in a tendon or possibly had done some serious damage to my kneecap the last time I fell while running in the rain.  I decided that I needed to call a doctor and have it checked out.  My regular doctor was able to get me in the next day, first thing in the morning.  He instructed me not to take painkillers or do anything that might effect the actual issue I was dealing with.  Normally, the pain went away relatively quickly, but not this time.  I was DYING to use some ICY HOT, or take some Advil.  As promised, the doc saw me at 9am bright and early - I had never been so happy to see him.  He ran some tests, took some blood, wrenched my knee this way and that until it brought tears to my eyes.  He also ran an extra AND took an Ultrasound.  All this uncertainty had me extremely worried.   He said he thought I had arthritis, but really wanted me to see an orthopedic doctor to confirm.  At 33, he felt I was really awful young and healthy to be worried about arthritis.   I was shuttled to the other side of the hospital offices to meet with the ortho doc.   He did, in fact, confirm that I had Osteoarthritis in my knee.   There really is no CURE or treatment, only a way to calm the symptoms.  I felt really defeated.  I loved to run - it was my source of stress relief and made me feel so good about myself.   The doctor suggested I cut back to my old running routine, and put the half marathon on hold - apparently by giving my knee a break and boosting bone strengthening vitamin intake - my knee might bounce back later.   But in my mind,...all I could imagine was being 45 and walking with a cane.

The crowd started to get into it as well with a few boo's of their own. Unfortunately, the group didn't care and continued to ruin the show. My friends were pissed and the concert was eventually shut down. I felt pretty bad. It upset me that there was nothing I could do about it. After we all went home, I received a call from an old friend in Brooklyn. He told me that every member of the group was arrested a few miles from the event for a DUI. I didn't mean to laugh but I couldn't help it. I told my friends and we all laughed together. I was relived.

I had awoken early, had breakfast at the motel and then drove downtown to visit an art museum I had been planning to see. I arrived early and was one of the first ones to enter. I noticed five other people waiting, two couples, one in their 50s the other couple younger, perhaps in thier 30s. There was also an older woman, she looked like she could be in her 80s. She wore a coat although it wasn't that cold out and walked with a distinctive wooden cane. The two couple went in as soon as the doors were unlocked and I held the door for the older woman to enter. The museum had a special showing of photographs from famous artist in Canada. I took my time walking through and viewing the work. On the third floor I noticed the old woman standing in front of two photographs by a woman photographer (I'll leave her name out) and I smiled at her as I passed behind the old woman and glanced at the photographers name and saw there were two photos of her work. I continued on and then went to the basement cafe for some coffee and a pastry. I was there about 30 minutes. I decided to walk through the museum again. On the third floor I noticed the old woman still standing in the same place. I approached her and after making eye contact, I ask her if she was OK?\"Oh yes, quite,\" she said, \"I'm just admiring my granddaughter's photographs.\"\"Oh, this photograph is your granddaughter?\" I asked.\"She was,\" said the old woman, \"but I'm afraid she died three years ago, an accident, she was 37.\"I told her how terribly sorry I was and then she told me she's lived in that town, but her granddaughter worked in Montreal,  so she only saw her every few years. But now she had come for eight days in a row and would continue to come into the work was moved to another city as it made her feel closer to her granddaughter than she had ever been. i complimented the work and invited the old woman down to the cafe for coffee.

It has taken me about two years of continuous study of the Bible to finally be approved for baptism. I was very happy when the elders told me that I was approved for baptism. I told all my friends and family. I had not been baptized at any church in my life except when I was a child and so I was determined to make this day a memorable one. I asked all the questions I could ask about it and felt anxious when the day arrived. During the baptism, a baptismal talk was given and we were told to answer two questions. After that, we all lined up to present ourselves at the baptismal pool. I was nervous as I went to the pool and was dipped into the water. The dipping into the water signifies that I have been dead to my former course of life and was reborn to a new life with service to Jehovah in mind. I celebrated the day with friends and family. After the baptism, I held a party for my friends and family. The party was held at my home and I gave a talk on the significance of the day for me. I was then asked questions by those present and they gave me advice on how to make a success of my new resolve to serve Jehovah. The day ended by my giving a little prayer to Jehovah that I would do his will all the days of my life.", "label": "recalled", "group": "DHWCVQF0"}

I'm usually a night person but I was set my alarm for 8 AM, excited for our shower to finally be repaired. I always keep my phone on silent and when my alarm goes off at 8 AM I notice I received a text message in the middle of the night from my roommate. The text read: \"lol who's the drunk snoring guy?\" I thought nothing of the message, seeing as we live close to downtown in a city that has a huge homeless crisis. Many nights I'm awakened by people screaming crazy shit as they walk past my house. I assumed a drunk guy fell asleep outside the house and she could hear him snoring from her room. Before the landlord arrives, I need to move my cat's kitty litter from the bathroom and bring it upstairs. I walk down the stairs and notice around the corner there's a dirty shoes hanging off the couch like somebody is laying there. I peak around the corner and what do you know it's the snoring drunk guy. Panic flushes over me as I realize that's not somebody my roommate invited in. I look at the doors, both are locked. No windows are broken. I go through all these different scenarios in my mind about who the person could be. Maybe it's an old tenant who knows my wife and still has a key. Maybe it was the maintenance guy that'd be helping my landlord that morning and he got here too early and decided to take a nap. I walk back up the stairs and wake up my roommate telling her I have no idea who the drunk snoring guy is. She's just as startled as me, assuming the guy was a friend of mine, but also much braver as she grabs an empty wine bottle next to her in case she needs to bludgeon anybody. She gets up in the sleeping guy's face and wakes him up with questions about who he is and why he's here. He looks just as startled as the both of us. Apparently, he came in through the kitchen window in the middle of the night, drunk as hell, thinking it was his friend's(our back neighbor's) house.

I was in desperate need of a doctor but didn't have health insurance.  I waited as long as I could and finally when my eyes began turning yellow and my skin a yellowish orange color, I decided it was time to go to the emergency room.  I was concerned of how I would pay for a visit but I knew something was wrong.  It was almost like I could feel death approaching me.  When I came into the emergency department, I was immediately triaged and when the doctor examined me, his first words to the nurse was, \"Book an OR, stat!\".  That was scary but at that point I was a the mercy of the physicians.  I prayed to God, asking for his protection.  Ten minutes later, I was under anesthesia, grasping at life.  The initial surgery took 2 hours and the second surgery took 11 hours.   In recovery, the doctor explained to me that I had to be opened up and fixed.  My gallbladder had gall stones and those gall stones had acted like bullets inside my body when my gallbladder had burst open.  The gallstones tore through my pancreas, liver, and right kidney.  They had to go in and do some repairs.  While the ordeal was traumatic and scary, it is a constant reminder that in a blink of an eye, I could have been 6 feet under right now.

There is a modern replica of one of the big sarcen stones, from the same quarry as the originals, on a sort of sled made of logs. It has a rope running to a meter. As you tug on the rope, it tells you how many more people you need on your rope to make the sled move.

I was working long and hard to improve on my thinking and leadership skills, but just could never crack or edge on through. My birthday took place on the day my mom wanted me and my husband to go with her to do an Escape Room. It was challenging, and exhausting, but we made some pretty substantial progress. There were so many different mechanisms involved that it was hard to imagine there was actually a way out. But I was excited, and I could tell my family was excited too. We had worked hard to make progress, and while it was slow, it was still progress. It was my first ever try at one of these rooms. I had only heard of them in passing but had never seriously looked into them. After that night though, I want to go more. It's an exhilarating way to pass the time and to have fun doing something a little bit different. It's hard to deal with certain things. Some things just felt counter-intuitive. We ultimately didn't make it to completion that night, but I'm confident I can do it if I had just a little more time.", "label": "imagined", "group": "1QP18CGJ"}

My boyfriend's grandmother passed away, and while we weren't technically family, she definitely felt like a family member to me.  She had always been so sweet and welcoming to me and I felt very close to her.  When she had to go into the nursing home after her knee replacement surgery, it wasn't that big of a deal because it was only for rehabilitation, so it wasn't like she was giving up her independence.  She was going to be back in her own home in about 6 weeks.  But she never went home.  During orthopedic rehab she fell and injured her other leg.  Of course everyone in her family was upset and so was I, but we still didn't think that it was a life threatening injury.  Then, after she was transferred back to the hospital, she developed a blood clot in the leg, it shot to her lungs and she was gone overnight.  My reaction was shock, I could hardly believe it could happen like that.  At first my boyfriend and the rest of the family seemed to be reacting the same way, in other words in an appropriate way.  Then after the funeral, things started to change.  People started making comments along the lines of how they felt relieved  that she was gone because they wouldn't have wanted to take care of her if she hadn't recovered well from the fall injury.  More and more family member started to agree with this, even my boyfriend.  They all seemed to be over their grief so quickly.  This response has been so devastating to me.  It's like I can't even turn to these people in my time of grief.  I honestly don't even know if I want to continue in my relationship after this because I can't believe he feels this way.", "label": "imagined", "group": "ZSKGCLHS"}

What kid doesn't enjoy getting a little dirty or at least one would normally think. But not our girls. We didn't last more than 30 minutes building sand castles and standing on the sand as the waves washed over our feet. They'd talk about going to the beach but as soon as we'd get there, they'd be bored or tired of walking on the sand. Although the beach itself didn't go over as well as we'd anticipated, at least the girls enjoyed getting away and \"seeing\" the beach from a distance. And at least we got pictures we can look back at...however short the time was. And the memories....oh the memories we created were priceless.

My eyes were getting tired quickly and I was experiencing a lot of mild headaches due to eyestrain. The doctor did a thorough examination and immediately noticed how terribly misaligned they were. He recommended me to a surgeon to get my eyes aligned. I have had misaligned eyes for almost half a century and had never considered surgery, because my older sister had surgery for her misaligned eyes and is now practically blind in one eye. I had decided to live with my condition and when I became an adult, I went through one year of vision therapy to correct the problem. Vision therapy did help, but over time my eyes went back to their old ways and turned in very significantly. The doctor explained to me that my condition is a little different from my sister's and that surgery will not cause me to lose vision, because I have alternating vision and my sister had another condition that caused her to shut one eye off completely. He said that at my age, surgery was really the only answer. So, I scheduled an appointment with a surgeon and had an evaluation done. The surgeon put all kinds of different prisms up to my left eye and immediately I saw double. The surgeon worked with me for several minutes and finally my eyes adjusted some. She told me that my left eye turned inward 70-80 points and she could only correct it to 40 points without me seeing double. She decided that it would be beneficial to do surgery on my right eye also, so that I can have at least 50 points of correction. I talked to my husband about the situation and he thought it was a good idea to have the surgery done. The surgery scheduler didn't contact me until three months later and informed me that I would have to go back down for a new evaluation before the surgery. I told her that if this was the case, I was not interested, because we had already paid $600 out of pocket for the first evaluation. She talked with the surgeon and the surgeon told her that I did not need a second evaluation, so the surgery was scheduled for August. Three weeks ago, my husband took me to the eye hospital and I underwent surgery on both of my eyes and I cannot believe how having mostly aligned eyes has changed my life! My crossed eyes have always caused people to look at me a little funny and some companies have not wanted to hire me, thinking there was something wrong with me. Children have always stared at me and asked why my eyes are so crossed. This is no longer a problem! Just last week, I took a trip into town to the grocery store and was amazed at how much better I was treated.

We had been together for about 9 months and it was long distance, but there was never really issue with jealousy or trust. I knew he had female friends, and he knew I had male friends, and it was never an issue. He is in Indonesia, and I am in America, so we talked through WhatsApp but our timezones often left us asleep/awake at opposite times and we only had a few hours each day to talk. We spoke through voicechat, videochat, and text messages. One morning about 3 weeks ago now, I woke up to a text message written in a different style than he writes that said something like \"I already have a girlfriend, don't talk to me again. Goodbye.\" I was obviously very surprised and confused and I asked him to explain and he said a female friend of his had taken his phone and written that because she was jealous. I said that was very strange and obviously she wanted to date him and he said no, they were just friends and she was being mean. I accepted that and moved on, but then about a week later it happened again, but this time when I told him about the messages he said that she had gotten jealous and confessed that she had feelings for him, and he felt the same, so he wanted to be with her and he and I would just be friends. It was shocking for many reasons because I had believed him when it happened the first time and told him she wanted to date him; he had known her for a long time, so why now; and I found it hard to understand how he would leave me for someone who was purposely trying to hurt me with the way she pretended to be him and say mean things to me. He wanted to stay friends, and I tried, but she began to control his life, and continued to say mean things to me while pretending to be him, blocked me on his phone, and got angry with him for playing a game with me on his phone.

I had intended to camp at a developed site next to a lake because it was bear country and there were bear-proof storage boxes at the campsites.  When I arrived at the lake I was disappointed in the area, there was nobody there (it was a weekday) but it was obviously heavily used and a bit dumpy.  I decided to ride further down the dirt road to see what else there might be.  I came across a trail and after a mile or so there was a small clearing in the trees.  I thought that it would make a suitable site to set up the tent.  It was a bit eerie - there were forest fires in the region and the sky was reddish from the smoke, there was also Spanish moss hanging from the tree branches which added to the creepy atmosphere.  At any rate, I made dinner, enjoyed a beer and went to sleep at about 11PM.  I was awakened by a piercing scream at around 3AM, it was absolutely terrifying and I had never heard anything like it before.  All that came to mind at the time was that there was a large bird like a eagle outside the tent screeching at something.  As I listened I could hear it walking around the tent about 100' away, there were small branches breaking under it's feet as it walked along... whatever it was it seemed pretty big.  I was too scared to open the zipper and look outside the tent, I didn't want to draw attention to myself and have to deal with this thing up close.  After over an hour the sounds became more and more faint and I eventually drifted to sleep.  In the morning I examined the ground where I had imagined it had been walking.  I found some very clear large paw prints - it was a mountain lion!

While neither my friend nor I are particularly pro-gun, my friend studies World War II history and owns a number of historic weapons that he wanted to operate. So we spent much of the day there until poor weather forced us indoors. Once the storms cleared out, we went back outside to take in a private fireworks show of questionable legality. The following day, we spent some time exploring Daytona Beach. We visited a few shops and my friend showed me a few of the more interesting sights. Later, we returned to Ormond and checked out the Rockefeller house. That night, we went to the race at Daytona Speedway. My friend's family owns property near the track and consequently has some connections, so we were able to tour the raceway prior to the race. Unfortunately the race was rained out, but it was still a memorable time. The following day, we returned to Gainesville, but prior to leaving, we decided to visit the beach. I spent almost my entire life in Ohio, and Gainesville, while obviously much closer to the sea, is still landlocked, so this marked the first time I got to see an ocean.

I waited, and was trying to get over how stunning this woman was, before I finally got up and decided to introduce myself and invite her to my table for some conversation.  She looked surprised, and asked really? Of course really, and I asked her if I could carry her coffee cup over, and she said yes and gathered her jacket and purse and came to sit with me.  We talked about everything from our careers, to our families, and even our heart aches. What was most surprising, was that she also was coming in that morning after a night out with her girlfriends who all were to hung over to get breakfast. We sat there for over 3 hours.  It felt like 15 minutes.  Not many people are lucky enough in their lifetime to make a connection such as this.  I thought she was stunning when I first saw her, now I just couldn't envision my life without her in it.  I thought I was crazy.  This is way to fast to have these feelings, or could love at first site be a real thing?  I don't know, but I wasn't going to questions it. It was not even 12 months later when I made her my wife, and here we are 15 months later, and I couldn't have found myself anyone else this amazing.", "label": "imagined", "group": "AOT2EYRS"}

Instead of eating the muffin at the courthouse I waited until i was dismissed completely and on my way home to eat it. Luckily. As I arrived home I decided to eat the muffin, but after taking a few bites I noticed something crunchy. I thought I purchased a banana muffin, and soon after realized it was a banana nut muffin. I happened to be allergic to walnuts and didn't think twice about how bad it would affect me. After trying multiple solutions to get the nut out of my system, it was to no avail and I ended up calling my mom and having her take me to the hospital.

We ended up renting a building at one of the parks close by and decided to hold the party there. My dad and brother brought a heater over hours ahead of time so that we could warm up the building, even though the rules said we were not allowed to have a heater there, it was just too cold, so we watched it closely. My husband cooked BBQ pulled pork and shredded chicken for the guest and my mother made an amazing cake and cupcakes. The cake was a decorate rice-crispy treat and the cupcakes were chocolate, all were made to look like Minny Mouse. We noticed that we forgot a cooler for the pops but it was so cold out and there was snow on the ground still so we just set the cases of pop outside the door to the building. No reason to run back into town when nature was providing its own cooler for us.  My sister and one of her friends also showed up early to help decorate. A decent amount of people showed up but we all had a good time. My mom got her sugar glider out to show people and it ended up jumping on everyone's heads.

I knew as soon as I hit the ground that this was really bad and the pain was immense.

Seeing him again also was positive because it sort of reignited our relationship, and we now have a bit of basis to build on to further enhance our relationship going forward. Meeting his family was very important as well. They are already almost young adults themselves now, and it was important for us to connect so that they knew who their extended family is.

I couldn't move so I screamed for my mom and it took a few minutes for her to hear me but finally se did and she came upstairs and saw what happened. She said it looked like a crime scene in my room because of all the blood. She said we were going to have to go to the ER and as much as I hate hospitals and doctors I knew she was right. So I managed to hobble into the car and once we got there I was seen reletively quickly. It was a horrible experience because the doctor had to numb te area before sewing it up but I kept feeling the pain as she tried to begin. It was very painful. She said my body was metabolizing the pain killer too quickly. It took about 5 stabs with a huge needle right into the wound before it got numb enough for her to sew it up. Finally I got to leave. I was on crutches for a few weeks and I still to this day have the scars, the one in the middle of my foot still hurts. I assume it probably will for a while but it could have been a lot worse.

The doctor had me in the cast and told me it will be changed every two to three weeks to help stretch the tendon. I have leg brace splint that keeps me from moving my foot to prevent further injury.

My wife was similarly affected, with the added complications of pre diabetes, and not being able to walk more than 100 yards without being winded.

We can move again, apnea is disappearing almost entirely, .It is a day by day process, one small step at a time, and an unrelenting focus on the goal.

My son (Jason) and Sarah, with their two little girls, live in an adjacent state, about a 5 hour drive. They scheduled a weekend visit to our home, which just happened to fall on Sarah's birthday. It wasn't a \"significant\" birthday, number wise, but I decided it would be fun to make an actual family party out of it. I figured mostly our two grand-daughters would find that entertaining. So, something I haven't done before, I bought birthday decorations (including a Happy Birthday banner, streamers, and hanging paper globes). I'm not an avid cook (but I do just fine when I need to) but I made a very special birthday dinner, complete with fancy drinks and apps. And, I bought a very elegant birthday cake from a local bakery, complete with candles to blow out. I also used a special tablecloth and had birthday plates and cups for our dessert. I told Ryan to take the family on a walk around the neighborhood so my husband and I could decorate. When they came home 1/2 hour later, Sarah (and the 2 girls) were very surprised and excited to see the decorations. Sarah even got a little teary-eyed and said she couldn't remember the last time she had a \"traditional\" birthday party. Everyone loved the food and commented how exceptional it was. The cake (and ice cream) dessert was also a huge hit. However, the best consequence was the laughter and fun and intimate conversation  that ensued between all of us and lasted well into the late evening. Although I have always had a good relationship with my daughter-in-law, I think she was really touched that I would go to so much work to do a really fun, kid-type birthday party for her. It was another step in bonding and growing friendship. Or, as my sister said, I \"got lots of points\" for this serendipitous plan!", "label": "recalled", "group": "ZBGAMSJW"}

She asked me to help hand out water, direct people and pretty much just be a a Jill of all trades during the race. I agreed, mainly because she is a good friend and I wanted to keep her, and helped out during the running of the marathon race. I watched the runners when they passed by during the race and thought that I could do that if I trained. I decided, for no real reason other than it was a challenge, to train for and complete a marathon. After my decision I looked up online what the best ways of training for a long distance race were and started to implement them. I trained for a little less than a year. I ran in rain, heat, snow and, worst of all, ice. I hate the winter and detest being cold but I went out and did the work anyway. I had always been athletic, playing sports in college and staying in shape at the gym over the years, but training by myself for a marathon was an entirely different level of fitness. There were days that I literally had to talk myself into training. I would hype myself up, out loud, to make myself go run in the cold. I am sure my husband thought I was crazy as he would come into a room and I would be talking, loudly, to myself to force myself into going out and running 15 miles. There were moments that were sublime, moments that were horrendous but overall, when I ran the race I thought all the training was worth it. I was proud that I had set a goal and completed it all while making my 4 year old daughter a part of the process. I made sure my daughter knew my goal and was there to watch me cross the finish line so she would know that she could set a goal herself, work hard and accomplish that goal. The race itself was more a part of the process as opposed to being the goal.", "label": "retold", "group": "G0CP0QND"}

We couldn't afford a large wedding ceremony and reception and all of the expenses that go along with traditionally getting married in the United States, so we decided to elope at home. We planned a short, private \"ceremony\" in our living room to be held the following week, and we invited only our close and direct family members to attend. In that week, I bought a casual $100 white dress and a small faux bouquet of flowers for our ceremony. My boyfriend and I were nervous a bit that we were moving too fast or not thinking everything through, but we knew we wanted to be married and that pre-wedding jitters are normal. The night before we married, we went out for a special dinner just the two of us. We discussed our nerves but also our excitement, and we wrapped up our vows that we planned on saying to each other. The next morning, the strap on my dress broke and we told our families to come over an hour later than planned so I could fix it to wear for our marriage. I was stressed out and cried a bit, wondering if this was a mistake and that we should wait to have a \"proper\" engagement and wedding. However, I told myself that the wedding itself wasn't the important part, the marriage was, and I was positive I wanted to get married. I fixed my dress, our families arrived, and everything was wonderful. We played some music and read our vows, I got very emotional and cried, and so did our families. My husband's family surprised us with a beautiful cake and champagne, and we had a toast and cut the cake. We grabbed a broomstick from our basement and jumped over it since our wedding was actually more of an elopement. We took a ton of photos in our living room to remember the special day, and went out to dinner together as a new family. I'll always remember this special day that I got married even though it wasn't what I imagined it to be. It was low-key and casual, and it was very special to us even though it was not a traditional wedding.", "label": "recalled", "group": "750QIGML"}

A few times she took too many pills and ran out before the end of the month. She simply lost count of how much she had taken. So I \"took control\" of her medicine.

I think a fox got them. There is a cornfield behind the house, and I just learned that foxes live in cornfields. The night before we locked up the coop and counted our chickens. All chickens were accounted for and ready for sleep. The next day we noticed one missing. She was broody and was attempting to hide a nest from us. This makes it more weird because they usually won't leave the eggs, but she was just gone. We counted our chickens that night, locked them up, and then searched the entire property for her. She was nowhere to be found. The next morning I let the chickens out, but then by 7 am there was two more missing. One of my white silkies and an ISA Brown. I went on an immediate search over the property. I then asked my neighbor for permission and searched her yard. They weren't there, but there was a strange place in the cornfield. So I walked further into the corn and there I found a pile of feathers from our Barred Rock, the first hen that went missing.", "label": "recalled", "group": "T05O7IAM"}

I have an anxiety condition that makes certain things hard for me such as strong emotional feelings and the inability to \"get over\" things. I was quite young when I met my husband but we instantly hit it off. Unfortunately in the beginning of our relationship we ran into some infidelity on my husbands part. Some very terrible things done right in front of me with terrible people only too eager to go along. Things that took years and years to stop haunting me every night but definitely never went away. I cant even think about these things without opening all the wounds back up. We got better and we moved on and we started to really grow together. We had children, he got more raises at his job. Recently we finally were able to move into a bigger and nicer house. I felt calmer and comfortable. Then one day about a month ago maybe not even that long, im sitting at the house cleaning up hanging out with the kids and I get a phone call. I answer it and its my husband and he doesnt know how to say it so he just does. The secretary at his work got fired and his boss hired a woman he had cheated on me with in the past. For most people that may have been uncomfortable but for me and my anxiety disorder it felt like a bomb went off in my head. I felt like all the air had been sucked out of the room and I started to cry and panic. It felt like my worst fear had sought me out to pluck me from the comfortability I had finally gotten used to. Its been hell since then. My husband has been faithful all these years since then and gives me no reason to doubt him but my anxiety doesnt care to hear any of it. He is trying his best and so am i, but i still sit here sick to my stomach thinking of that horrible woman up there in his space.

Aunt places her purse by the front door. It's a huge monstrosity of a bag that is open at the top. This will be important later. They complain about the food all through lunch. We just ignore this and continue with fun of the day. After lunch, the parents are all drinking coffee in the dining room while the younger kids play and watch movies in the salon by the front door. Entitled cousin does not want to watch the movie that is on, I think it was Frozen, saying it is lame and is a kids movie.  She takes the remote and changes it to Game of Thrones. All the other kids are mad and complain that the show is too scary.  A tussle ensues for the remote and in the course of the wrestling, Aunts bag is knocked over and items scatter onto the floor.  My Sister comes in and tells everyone to quiet down, changes the show back to Frozen and takes the remote which makes Entitled cousin cry and scream that Nephew hit her and wants him punished. Aunt comes in and yells at Nephew that Cousin should have what she wants and for Nephew to stop being a brat. Then Aunt sees her bag knocked over and starts screaming at Nephew that he is stealing from her. She picks up her bag and says her FitBit is missing. I roll my eyes because of all the crap in that bag, how would she know immediately that her FitBit is missing. Aunt demands Nephew turns his pockets out. Nephew says he does not have her FitBit and to leave him alone. Sister tells Aunt that her Nephew does not have her FitBit and maybe she should look under the couch where her bag fell over. One of the other kids does just this and does find her FitBit. Aunt yells at Nephew saying he stowed it there for later so Sister tells Aunt that this is rediculous and it is time for them to leave.", "label": "imagined", "group": "Z3L5WF4E"}

They wanted me to stick around to MAYBE do a heart cath, but that would have been another two days in the hospital and as I said I was feeling fine. So I left.

One day in May my Black Lab started to limp slightly but nothing to serious and worrisome, considering my 3 dogs played rough and wild we thought it was just a minor injury. A week went by and the limp was getting noticeably worse. My mom and i became concerned and soon after called and schedule a Vet appointment for the following week. The day finally came to take my dog, to the vet, thinking it was a minor issue my vet gave her a quick look and basically said she was fine and just hurt her back jumping. At that point i was not to concerned thinking he knew exactly what he was talking about. Another week went by and the limp got even worse. Again we took her back to the Vet, this time he had done an X-ray. Days later the results of the X-ray came back and he said she had a slight disc slip in her back, that has been there a while but nothing that should be causing the limp, he gave her medication for inflammation and sent us on our way. A few days went by and at this point nothing he gave her was helping and no answers that we were looking for came about. Finally we decided to take her to a specialist Vet who does all kind of blood testing and jelly scans and better testing. My family and I walked in that day to the specialist thinking that we were going to pay for our dog to get any surgery she needed to help her limp. After hours of waiting for her blood test results and scan results we finally got our answer, our dog had cancer. We were crush, our lives were shattered the moment we heard she had spleen cancer. For a single moment we were excited to find out that surgery could be done for 10 thousand dollars that we were 100000% willing to pay, but only if the cancer has not spread into her lymph nodes. Upon a few further tests the Vets found that it had spread all through out her body and lymph nodes. That night and the next day we said our goodbyes at that point she was no longer able to walk. This was the worst day of my life, i cry everyday still thinking about her. My life forever changed this day, my attention is constantly with my other 2 dogs who lost their best friend.

However around this time I believe funds were limited and I was just barely getting by with a few earnings saved here and there. So you can imagine how freaked out I was when I noticed my computer wouldn't boot. I had to test out my equipment at a friends house, which lead me to the conclusion that my CPU was causing the issue. At that time I thought I was screwed, I was using an older version of Intel's i5 CPU and they stopped selling those years ago. Buying used on E bay was a shot in the dark because the prices were high and you could never tell about the quality of the item until after you bought it. Lets just say I've had some bad experiences with E bay and used items. Anyway, just when I thought my luck was down and out some of my family members came to my rescue and loaned me the money I needed to purchase a new CPU. I don't recall if I mentioned this in the last diary entry I did about this subject, but not only was I able to afford a new CPU, they also gave me enough money to buy a new motherboard and ram as well. My old motherboard was using DDR3 ram while the new ones moved on to DDR4. They wanted me to buy a brand new CPU with a new motherboard and ram as well which was a huge surprise. I was so thankful to those family members that stepped in and helped me when they didn't have to. To this day I'm still very grateful for having such an amazing family. Also a little update on the story, since then I've paid them back fully for what they did. They didn't want to accept it at first, but I insisted that they had to accept my payback.", "label": "retold", "group": "VA5V32XC"}

My sister is a bit unconventional, I guess you could say, so the wedding was no different. It wasn't set in a church or in a field next to a barn like a lot of weddings these days. Instead, it was held in an underground cave. It began with guests being blind folded and led down stairs deep into the cave. They were seated at there assigned table and then when the blindfold was removed they could see the beautiful surroundings. My whole family ended up attending, which was a huge surprise. Everyone was so happy and joyous to see that the whole family was there, including those some people haven't seen for years. The evening began with my sister and her groom making a grand entrance and performing a short ceremony. Afterwards, the drinks started flowing and the real fun began. There was a light show with lasers, smoke machines, and a fantastic DJ. Everyone was having such a good time, and the surroundings pushed everyone to let loose. Fun and laughter was had by all, especially since the drinks just kept on coming. I'm sure some people thought they would never make it out of the cave alive. I'm sure to this day we still have a few family members trapped inside. All in all it was probably the best wedding I have ever been to. It was unique and different, and the best part was everyone was able to attend. I only hope that my wedding can even come close to the fun everyone had that evening.

He was asking how i liked being in a band and did i like the city?  I soon realized that he thought I was a member of the sexdolls band.  I was really flattered but I tried to tell him I was not a member of the band but he wouldn't believe me,  He just kept winking at me saying he wouldn't tell anyone who I was.

He asked for a picture so I took a selfie with him.  After I had left the bar I giggled all the way home wondering if and when he would figure out that I was not a member of the sexdolls group.  That's something I'll probably never forget getting mistaken for a member of such a popular band.  The next day I was telling my friends about what had happened.  They told me next time the sexdolls were in town that I should dress like they do and see if anyone mistakes me for one again.  I told them that would be hilarious.

I don't typically go back to a relationship, but when he approached me again a year later, I considered it. There had been some really great aspects, certainly. The next time was better, but still not great. I once again felt ignored and that he wasn't listening to me plainly telling him what I needed in a relationship - I didn't demand anything, but I told him how I felt and he said he would improve or change and never did. After months of this, I sat down with him and told him that if he couldn't meet me in the middle the way I had tried to meet him, it seemed our relationship was over. He accused me of being abusive, which was devastating. I have been through abusive relationships and consider myself pretty aware of what is abusive and what is not, to be accused of abuse is so hurtful. We stopped talking again. Then a few months ago, C messaged me. It was an apology. Looking back...I don't think his first apology was so great. We more agreed that it was an incompatibility issue. But this second apology was so healing for me. He took responsibility for everything he had done in the relationship, apologized for calling me abusive, and explained how he was addressing his more hurtful behaviors. Considering how little things really changed between the first and second times, I can see that he was not addressing the core of his issues. Having such a broad, bold, honest, open apology, with no conditions, was so immensely healing for me.

When I first married Rod almost 22 years ago, I had no idea what I was in store for. Sure, I knew I'd be moving in with someone for the first time, so I'd lost some of my autonomy. We'd argued before, and I knew we'd argue again in the future. The wedding vows confirmed that we were joined together for richer or poorer. No matter how high we went, we'd be together. But I had no idea just how high or low those things would take us. For our 22nd anniversary yesterday, Rod surprised me with a series of trips that illustrated just how we've gone on that journey together. We first went out on a boat to symbolize the start of our journey: setting sail. After we'd sailed out far enough, we jumped in the water and started to swim around. That was to represent when, early in our marriage, I miscarried, and we realized that things wouldn't always be so easy. There were times we'd have to swim together ourselves, doing the hard work ourselves. After we'd tired ourselves out, we hopped back on the boat and had a picnic. This one was to remember that whenever we're taxed for events like that, we'll always have the fruit of our marriage to nourish and sustain us. We had a lot of fruit on the way back, actually. And then he finished up with something I couldn't have imagined: a hot air balloon ride at sunset with champagne and all. It was in recognition of our commitment - no, our promise - to sail off into the sunset together.

I knew he was getting married, so I did want to be there for him in whatever capacity he wanted me to be in. It was tough to be there initially, because I didn't want to give off the impression I was just there out of pity. A surprising thing happened, however. We hit it off after a while apart and seemingly rekindled the friendship that had burned so brightly for so long. We talked about old times. We certainly talked about dumb things one another did. But we also talked about how he met the love of his life, and also had future plans we all were having. It's a good reminder that a lot of negative feelings are temporary. They fade and fluctuate with the gift of hindsight. We were glad this wedding brought us together. I don't know if we could ever be the best of friends again.

At the start of the semester we all got along really well, but by the end of it, we were fighting more. We had one situation in particular that stuck out to me. I was sitting, as we usually did, 5 of us in the living room, because the 6th man was going a little crazy- I do not know if it was his meds or what, but we were just watching TV as a group and it was awesome we did that a lot. Anyway, 6th man walks in, well him and (lets call him 4th man- 4th being the number of his bedroom just like 6 is for 6th man) 4th man got into some heated arguments recently. 4th man is a ripped dude who got me to go to the gym for the first time in my life, and I am sticking to it, been going for about 4 months straight now and I feel great. So we all agree if 6th man tried something 4th man could just take him no problem and we were all kind of secretly hoping someone would show him how stupid and petty he was being(6th man). He kept on complaining when we did not invite him to stuff. At first it was not on purpose, but then we did kind of stop inviting him to stuff just because he kept freaking out that we did not like him or whatever the heck he was thinking. Truth is, he stayed in his room most of the time - so, yeah, we are not inviting you because we JUST made the plans like 1 hour ago, not on purpose, just with whoever was in the living room. We should not have to specifically go in to everyone's rooms to personally invite them to something. Hang out, and you actually hang out with us. Hang in, and you are gonna miss out, not because we hate you, but because you just are not hanging out with us. Anyway, 6th man wanted something from the fridge, so he goes and 4th man is already in the fridge door. Now, I'll admit 4th man egged it on JUST a little, but he did egg it on by standing in the door acting like he did not see 6th man for just a second. 6th man says move, grabs his thing and then as he is walking to his room says, \"if you ever do that again I'll slap you so hard you're gonna wish you had never been born\" boom, slams the door and walks to his room. We all we like, \"4th man, what did you do?!\"  So 4th man was telling us, \"I did not do anything except grab my stuff from the fridge, lol\".. So the fact that 4th man was also like wtf? made us realize it was just 6th man being crazy. Well, 6th man sends a text to 4th man saying that he knows why 4th mans girlfriend of 2 years just broke up with him, saying he was a piece of crap, etc. Well we all did not see the text since it was just to 4th man, so 4th man gets up and says, \"thats it\". Oh crap! lol, We all knew it was about to go down, so I tell the other dude in the apartment who was a big, tall guy to get in there, and he totally does. Long story short, nothing happened thankfully, but that whole situation was freaking crazy for the whole semester.", "label": "recalled", "group": "CB7QSGB2"}

I was told I needed to pick her up because she had ran away from home. So of course I was on my way to get her soon after. While I was on the way to her I was able to get in touch with her mother. She told me that she had locked her out of the house because she had a friend over after school that she was not supposed to be associating with. I was told that the friend was a drug user and so when they were found together her mother decided to make them leave. This seemed like a rash decision to me considering the first thing my daughter did was go to her friends house. When it was discovered where she had went my daughter's mother called the local police and reported her a runaway. Knowing where she was the police went to the house and picked her up. They took her to the police station where she refused to go back with her mother because she felt unsafe there at that point. Once I arrived I was able to sort things out with child protective services and take her home with me. Since then she has lived with me in my care and in a new city.

Being with the group was reminding me of times as a kid when I went swimming in these kinds of places with friends. It was making me sad that I don't do it that often anymore. So I felt that going of on my own and gathering my emotions would be best. I walked around on the rocks and looked at the trees of the forest behind it.

We both love being in nature, and a chance to see some snow in the middle of summer sounded amazing. I took a bus from Los Angeles to meet him in Oakland, and then we drove the rest of the way to Lassen. We were lucky enough to find a nice campsite in Manzanita Lake Campground. We spent the first day wandering around the lake, kayaking, admiring the views, and just lounging beneath the pine trees in our tents. The next day, we drove to Burney Falls, which was beautiful, and then passed by a lava cave, and then onwards to Butte Lake. We hiked up the Cinder Cone Trail, trudging up the short but steep and slippery slope of cinders, leading to the crater and to more gorgeous views of mountains, lakes, and volcanic beauty. After a long day, we headed back to the campground and stopped beside the lake to watch the sunset and the alpenglow reflected on the water. The next morning, we woke up early to hike up Mt. Lassen, which was still covered in snow, driving past tall snowbanks and snow-covered landscapes. I was worried about the snow and how well our microspikes would perform, but it turned out fine! We arrived at the trailhead around 7 am, with only a few cars in the lot, and slowly but surely made our way up the summit, following the muddy tracks left across the snow by other hikers. We enjoyed watching some skiers quickly zip down the slopes from the summit, wondering at their speed and balance and fearlessness. My brother was hit by a bout of altitude sickness, so we arrived at the summit around 11, taking our time to catch our breath and admire the views. After some rest and lots of pictures, we headed back down, the snow becoming slushier with the increasing heat and traffic. It was an invigorating hike, and I found myself happy to not let my fears and doubts prevent me from experiencing it. We drove some more to the Visitor's center, awestruck by the wide views of forests, wildflowers, and the streams of water from the melting snow.

My husband and I had the fewest, mostly due to the kids realizing I know rocks and asking me for lots of help. The little girl found a geode in one of our buckets as well. The kids later crushed it with a rock. They couldn't wait for us to find a hammer to crack it for them. It was cute, how excited they were. And that way, every kid got a piece.

Day 2 we spent the entire day at Sea World.

We ate our way through the shows and the rides and all the fun animals there were to see. My daughter was so happy being there. My son loved the rides there too which was cool to take him on since now that he is older, he can go on more and more rides. Day 3 we did the Wild Animal Park which has this cool tram that takes you through all the different exhibits like the rhinos and the giraffes and the hippos. My kids had a great time seeing all the animals there since our zoos here in WA don't really have many of those, let alone being that close up. We also got to ride in a hot air balloon there too!

While the bulk of the work was in the spring, the preparation had gone back months. Early on in the preparations for it, the principals had told me I needed to include younger grade levels. In years past, it had only been for 5th and 6th grade, with some older middle schoolers helping out as volunteers. Most of the activities in the past were aimed at older elementary and middle school students, so including younger kids really concerned me. I was worried that it was going to add a lot of extra preparation work because I had to come up with activities that could reasonably include them. Even in the official science olympiad competitions, their suggested activities are for much higher grade levels. I also was concerned because I really wanted it to come off well because I was trying to get my old job back as a full time science teacher. At the time I was primarily teaching math, which they had moved me to, but I did not like that job. So I put a lot of time in to find the right activities to do that all grade levels could enjoy and be engaged with. It was done with the intent that even if some of them were challenging, they were of the sort that the older kids could easily help the younger ones and keep them interested. Regardless, it still took a lot of hours outside of regular school hours. It was all I did in my spare time in the weeks leading up to it. I had to write all the directions, purchase and organize all the materials, communicate with all other staff members and volunteers who were running events. I had to create individual schedules for all students involved and make sure directions were clear enough for all to move successfully to different events. In the end, despite my fears that the younger kids would be too young and also too poorly behaved to be able to handle it, they did well.

Our new home is ready for us when we get there. its very nice and im pleased with the outcome. it even has solar panel hook ups. We have just about wrapped up everything we need to wrap up. Some of the last things we have to do is go to some doctor follow up appointments and see if we can get some type of recommendations for doctors in California. Then just for good measure i went and got an extension on my medications for 60 days. It took a little effort but they were sympathetic. I spent last night drinking beer with my brother and reminiscing about our mother. We had a good time i drink way to much than i should have but it was worse it.  Then later that night when i was laying in bed I got a phone call  from my other (he took my moms dog)  brother who told me that my moms dog died that night. i took it hard because it was my moms dog and i felt like it was kinda like the last part of her is gone.", "label": "retold", "group": "ZTANC3WG"}

The only bad thing is there was absolutely no cell phone service in the area, but it was nice to be disconnected for a while. We spent the weekend laying around by the lake and just relaxing. My girlfriends parents are really great and they cooked a nice dinner for us the first night. We didn't really do much else other than lay around. It was a much needed break from the crazy pace of my life. I felt like I got a lot closer to my girlfriends family too, which was nice. After the weekend was over we got into the car to head back home. I turned my cell phone on once we got out of the mountain range and was surprised to see I had over 20 missed calls. They were all from my best friend Ben. I immediately called him back and he was on the other end crying. His mother had died that morning. I felt absolutely horrible that I hadn't been there for him when it happened. He knew it wasn't my fault that I hadn't answered the phone, but I still felt really bad. The rest of the car ride home was very stressful. I couldn't wait to get home to go see Ben and his family.

The first tree that I chop down was about 70 ft tall and about a foot in diameter. I used to axe that I bought off Amazon to do the work. I was not very confident at first. It was hard to swing the axe for more than 10 minutes or so at a time and I got blisters all over my hands and I had to start wearing goggles since wood chips would fly everywhere. The first tree that I chopped down was undertaken by steps learned off YouTube. This involves put into wedge-shaped cuts on the front and back sides of the tree. One is called a face cut and faces the direction you want the tree to fall. The second is the felling cut and is 180 degrees behind the face cut. As I was chopping the felling cut the tree started to shake and Creek so I ran to the side to get out of the way and the tree fell the wrong direction. It was very scary as the tree was easily heavy enough to kill me if it had fallen on me. I later learned that a tree will generally fall in any direction it has a lean, no matter how deep a face cut you put into it. This was a frightening but educational experience. It gave me some PTSD in regards to chopping the trees. I was very cautious when making my face and felling cuts because having a tree go the wrong way can result in it being hung up in other branches which is very dangerous.", "label": "recalled", "group": "QAZNCDNO"}

It was the first time we had been on vacation with just the two of us.  We had so much fun!  We stayed out late every night, and racked up over 30,000 steps on our last day in the parks!  Needless to say, we were exhausted at the end of the day, but it was worth it!  We got to ride all the rides we wanted, got to try three different kinds of butterbeer, and got to have ice cream from Florean Fortescue's.  Our favorite ride was the one that goes through the Hogwarts castle. It was like being right there in the movies!  Another good one was the ride that went through Gringotts Bank.  It was funny to watch the people jump when the dragon on top blew his fireball.  We made sure to eat at both The Leaky Cauldron and The Three Broomsticks.  Both had really good food, especially for a theme park.  While we were there, we heard that they're going to open a new ride that's based on Hagrid's motorcycle We will have to make a return trip to ride that one once the hype has died down.  Another of our favorite spots was the Dr. Seuss world.  It was fun to see all the characters, and they seemed to have some of the best shirts and merchandise. A really cool restaurant was the Toothsome Chocolate Emporium.  It's decorated in 19th century steampunk decor, and was really unusual.  Their ices cream sundaes averaged $15 each, but they were well worth it.  The one I got had a whole piece of red velvet cake on top of it!  We made sure to take lots of pictures to remember the trip. This was definitely a bonding experience for us that we will remember for the rest of our lives.", "label": "recalled", "group": "49JD9Z3W"}

It's very beautiful during the day, but reminds me of something out of a horror movie at night. I had my high beams on most of the way since there aren't many cars on the road out there, especially late at night. And since the roads aren't very well lit the high beams help. I was also pretty tired since I left work late that night and wanted to be extra safe. Unfortunately it wasn't safe enough as I hit a deer that night and ran into a ditch. I'm not sure where the deer came from, well actually it probably came from the forests surrounding the roadway. But I never saw it coming. I hit the deer straight on and it smashed my windshield before I flew into the ditch. I remember seeing blood on my windshield before I ran into the ditch, I thought it was mine for the split second that I was still in control of my car. My car was totaled, but I was okay.

He is always waiting for me at the door when I come home from work, he loves to brush up against me and show affection, and he has the sweetest meow. When I first adopted Fluffy, he was already missing one eye, but it never really seemed to bother him. He got around about as well as I expect any cat would, and his disability didn't seem to bother him. I loved him all the same. However, one day I noticed that he seemed to have trouble navigating around; he was more cautious, wasn't as accurate in his jumping abilities, and occasionally would run into an object. I didn't notice anything obviously physically wrong with him, but I decided to take him to the vet to see what was going on. The vet gave me some bad news: Fluffy's vision in his one remaining eye was deteriorating and the cause was ocular cancer. The doc gave me two options -- we could remove Fluffy's remaining eye to prevent the spread of the cancer, or we could do nothing but monitor the situation. In the first case, Fluffy would be totally blind, but in the second, he may only have several months to a year before the cancer spread and took his life. I was devastated and told the vet I would have to think about it. He said he would respect whatever decision I made, but if we were to operate, it should be done as soon as possible. I went home and thought long and hard about the decision. I didn't want to take away Fluffy's one remaining eye and plunge him into a world of sightlessness, but I also couldn't stand the thought of losing my wonderful companion of so many years. In the end, I couldn't deprive my cat of such a vital sense as his sight. Although it may prolong his life, it seemed more like a selfish demand on my part. The vet said he likely wouldn't suffer much, and that we would check up on him frequently to see if he was in any pain. If the time came when he was suffering, I would try to do right by my furry friend and ensure his passing was painless. It has been two months since I made my decision, and I still question whether I'm doing the right thing. I try to spend as much quality time as I can with Fluffy and enjoy him without thinking about the inevitable future. Time is so precious to us living things, and it must run out some day, but in the meantime Fluffy is still the cat he always was -- if a bit slower -- and so far his cancer hasn't spread.

My supervisors watched me be harassed and did nothing. After my outburst I knew I was done at that company, so I quit. I just grabbed my things and walked out. I remember getting in my car and crying my eyes out. I needed that job. I hadn't done anything wrong. I really thought my life was over.", "label": "imagined", "group": "KYGR8HVW"}

Her last surgery for her facial reconstruction was last month. We are praying that is truly the last surgery she needs. Her face is looking back to normal finally. I will never forget the day I got that phone call. Jane was in the hospital. She had been badly beaten by her boyfriend. He had gotten drunk and started accusing her of cheating on him, and then he just snapped and beat the life out of her. When I got to the hospital I lost it. Seeing my baby in that hospital bed. Her entire face was one giant bruise. She was so swollen she couldn't open her eyes or talk. They had her sedated to relieve the pain and give her a chance to heal. I sat by her bedside for days crying. She had told me several times that her boyfriend was abusive. I never took it seriously. I don't know why. I thought she was being dramatic. Her boyfriend always seemed so sweet and respectful. Now I sat here thanking God that she was still alive, but knowing it was partially my fault. I should have told her to move back in with me. I should have done something. I still can't forgive myself.", "label": "imagined", "group": "KYGR8HVW"}

As a photographer and musician, I tend to dress more in a punky aesthetic.  I figured he would be into sports and Alma Matters and I would be into plants and dive bars and we would sit awkwardly.  But he was very attractive and he was nice when he messaged me so I gave him a chance.  It turns out we have more in common then I would have ever thought and we get along super well.  Honestly, if this guy wants to marry me I would in a heartbeat.  I am still seeing him and he is the most mature adult person I have ever been with.  His clothes were not indicative of his personality.  I learned that stepping out of my preconceived notions and comfort zone I was able to meet a much better partner.  He is stable and a good communicator.  He also happened to be a musician and owns a ginseng farm on the side of doing executive financial work as a day job.  The job explained his aesthetic and I got plants and music and dive bars in his interests too.  I am very lucky that he is quite taken with me as well.  He inspires me to be a better person.  I realized I just gushed about him for this whole writing, but I think the original point of this was to say that I learned a lot about how I was limiting myself and being judgmental and was very wrong.  I grew from this experience.", "label": "retold", "group": "X0I40TRO"}

It had not bee long since our last fight. I thought it would be good to take a trip. The strain we have been having might need some mending. We told each other stories of odd people we had met in the past. And also the stories of new stranger people we met on the train. It was revealing to us that most of the problems that we had were so minor compared to others. I felt like we were being petty, picky, and weak. Compared to other peoples stories, we were. So it was good to know we had other things to worry about. Just not at the moment. We felt relieved.", "label": "imagined", "group": "YX0KX5Q6"}

She heard i got fired. I told her that she knew more than me becasue they hadnt even told me that i was fired. I am not that upset about it. I am getting unemployment and i actually already got another job. I start next week. Even though i am getting unemployment it is still upsetting and a bit humiliating. I dont know what else to say.

{"id": "3GDTJDAPVVXU3B7FNMZ2S3CMZPVM8S", "text": "Actually this happened six weeks ago, though have been applying for jobs on line Including this company. This particular new company notified me of a phone interview I needed to carry out with them and I did that and was later invited for a meet and greet dinner. In  the long run, I was expecting this since it was a phone Interview earlier and the company would want to have a physical interaction with their employee. As usual, I found out the name of the restaurant, also took time to check out their menu online and found out the names of the persons I would be meeting at the dinner; the CEO and all that using a search engine, Google to be precise.             I took time to also study the company and the position I was applying for. With all this, I was set for the dinner as at the evening of that day by 6:00 pm, I was dressed professionally, On getting there ,I turned my phone off ,I interacted with my employers politely, observed good table manners and answered all questions trowed at me with as much confidence as I could. This was a wonderful experience for me. We kept on keeping a conversation and the employees weren't so strict after all. I also enjoyed the environment. The restaurant was cozy and the noise was controlled. I could have space and time to feel relaxed and think properly. I must say that digging into the juicy steak offered was difficult but since I knew the interviewers where expecting me to eat, I planned before hand. I also ordered for something that was easy to eat aside the steak. I stayed away from messy dishes. In all, I was involved in the conversation too. I asked my interviewers questions when I deemed it necessary. At the end of the dinner, they Extended me an offer . I accepted the job and gave notice.", "label": "imagined", "group": "GXW3XXD0"}

It was pretty impromptu and unexpected but I was happy to be on their radar. We all had a great time and I felt really involved with them. We have hung out multiple times between the time that I wrote that entry and now. The party was small and intimate. I saw other friends that I haven't seen for months and one that I haven't seen for closer to a year. We reconnected and I felt a warm feeling of togetherness. We reminisced on things that happened years ago. I stayed the night at their place and we went out to get food in the morning. It was nice to hang out with them in a more sober sense. I made sure that my surprise and gratitude was genuine and not just the effects of alcohol. Turns out it was genuine and I beat myself up for thinking I was ever ostracized from them. I realized that it was most likely me just being anxious and crafting a narrative in my head that had no basis in reality. I am almost giddy in anticipation of the next time I will hang out with them. I seriously can't wait.", "label": "retold", "group": "WC8S00XS"}

In fact I think its the hardest part.  As I wake up you think your dream mind tends to feel like they are still there.  The same old routine.  But then you lean over and they aren't there anymore.  And all these pains keep flooding back to me.  It's easier to deal with at work, but when home alone again it is just way too difficult.  I need people around me or I just sink into my own thoughts.  My family and friends keep trying to reach out and comfort me, but I just tell them I'm doing okay and I think they buy the lie.  Too be honest I'm broken and have no outlook for my future since this wasn't what it was supposed to be.  What do I do with my life.  I don't even know.", "label": "imagined", "group": "95H4KW2A"}
