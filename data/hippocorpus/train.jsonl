They say getting there is half the fun, and we definitely try to make this half the fun on this trip. We stopped and saw a few sites, and national parks on the way, and it was beautiful. We had a fun time getting there. We spent the first night at a hotel near Los Angeles. The next morning we got up early and made it to Universal Studios Hollywood. We spent the day in this theme park and it was a lot of fun. My grandkids especially loved all of the Harry Potter stuff. Another highlight was getting to go on the studio tour. Everyone seemed to like getting to see where movies and television were filmed, and experiencing that awesome tram ride. We spent the rest of the day at the park going on all the different rides and all the different lands. My son-in-law really liked going through the walking dead maze. All in all it was really fun that day. Another highlight was after dark when the Harry Potter castle lit up, and they had a show in which the dark forces tried to take it over. It was a really fun day. We spent the next day doing much the same thing in Universal Studios, before driving to Oceanside where we spend another ten days at the beach. The remainder of the trip included a whale watching tour, many days lounging at the beach, and lots of fun with family and friends just enjoying the ocean.", "label": "retold", "group": "MH9U6AOE"}

I would sit in the back of the car and make animal noises during the entire drive.  Granny Ma would try to guess which animal I was but most of her guesses were always wrong.  When I told her which animal I was, she would tell me how smart I am.  I remember her long curly hair and how we would sit in front of the bathroom mirror as she would brush it out.  She would tell me how important it was to brush slowly in order to keep the hair healthy.  The thing I remembered the most was her smell.  Her home was a like a jasmine garden mixed with warm scents of vanilla and tea.  Everywhere she went left a trail of floral aroma.  It was such a pleasant, comforting smell.  I remember the last time I saw Granny Ma.  Five months ago I was sitting at the foot of the hospital bed.  Granny Ma was covered in tubes, monitors, and wires.  She would lay and smile at me with such soft eyes.  Her hand rested on mine as I would tell her stories of our trips to the zoo, how much I loved her homemade pies, and memories of listening to her play the flute.  I told her about our walks around the community park and how I would light up when I could smell her perfume.  Granny Ma told me how lucky she was to have me in her life and how happy she was to experience it all.  Granny Ma told me that she never had any regrets during her life and wouldn't change a thing.  That night Granny Ma went to sleep forever and the most amazing woman is now blessing Heaven with her heavenly scent.  I still miss her.", "label": "imagined", "group": "JUJ4PK47"}

Also giving praises to The Most High (TMH) for allowing me to do so. Every God allows me to awake is another day to serve him. My days usually go by simple enough: wake eating/or drink sometimes both if money available or the want or need to is here. Studying the Bible and people, animals and the world around me is fascinating in itself. I study and apply God's laws through the faith of Jesus Christ: by overcoming my trials and tribulations, giving charity whether it be in the form of wisdom or materials, and working with others in various communities throughout the united states so far. Ok so waking up the first thing I do is show thanks to God. Next is some scripture reading, videos, or music. Next up is food. I've taken a so called \"vegan\" route recently so I focus on fruits vegetables, grains and foods from trees. Among drinks I have water (various types) along with fruit juices(natural are preferred). When it comes to milk I use almond, rice, oat, etc. Then finding some form of work. I am growing to understand that tradition work in most people minds that I've grown up with (9-5) is not the best form. So I am constantly looking \"work\" or the lifestyle where I get paid to do what I love. Most of it is teaching even if its online or not. It's always in the spectrum of making life more honorable even in the lowest situations or at least that's where I'm beginning at even though our history doesn't start from those \"cloths\" This journey is forever so growth is always expected even in the smallest area such as appearance changes, updating tech, and understanding people situations to guide them to overcome SIN and parts of their lives they don't like. Just those few actions are almost always a full day.", "label": "recalled", "group": "BQ3PKEZI"}

It was memorable in the sense that it was the first planned outing with my children, who are still toddlers. It's been difficult as a homemaker with my toddlers, especially during the first couple of years. I feel like I sacrificed a lot to personally raise them, and sometimes I still feel ambivalent about my decision to have a family. So to say this was personally memorable, at least to me, might be a bit of an understatement. The part about the holiday party that stood out the most was just sitting in their backyard and drinking a beer straight from the bottle with the sun shining on my face. I was tasked with watching one of my toddlers while my spouse took care of the others. It felt easier with one kid. I think the work multiplies significantly with more children, and I can understand why most parents these days want to stick to one child. Anyway, that moment in the backyard felt relaxing, like something I hadn't experienced in a long time. It was equal parts freedom, and for a moment, it felt like I didn't have any kids at all. I mean, I had one that I was watching at that time, but that fleeting moment felt like a tasty raindrop when you're stranded in a barren hot desert wasteland. My children thoroughly enjoyed the event, despite not really eating the great food. They got to play around with other children that were also there, and they got to see what an actual party with adults seems like.

She was in an assisted living facility where she had been for two years due to increasing dementia and heart related health issues. One week we went to go to an event that was held at her facility that was supposed to be a family dinner and celebration. My grandma would not get out of bed to attend. This was very unlike her and from that moment on for the next three weeks she gradually stopped getting up at all, eating, and finally drinking. A few weeks before her death she was put on end of life care, hospice, and I made it a point to be at her home every day for several hours a day helping to care for her. This was both heartbreaking and beautiful all at the same time. To be able to care for someone who cared for me almost my whole life was very eye opening and humbling and extremely emotional.

A few days before she passed she became sort of comatose as she stopped drinking water and responding to anything other than pain, and a lot of pain she had. It was such an honor to be a comfort to her while she was in the transition from life to death.  The most memorable part of this was the day before she died, where she had been no responsive for several days, I started to talk to her about my childhood and what a huge influence she was on me and how much I loved her and wanted to model my life after hers.

Sure, I know, you're supposed to celebrate the lives of elders who die, but for me, losing my first grandparent wasn't something I could see a silver lining in. Grandpa lived in India, and Grandpa was dying. We first started coming to India almost 20 years ago, when I was a baby. My mom is Indian, born and raised in this wonderful country, but she moved to the United States to marry dad in her early 20s. Her parents stayed in the only land they'd ever known. In fact, Grandma and Grandpa had never even visited us back home in Alabama. We'd only ever traveled to them. We all wanted Grandma to move with us to the US when Grandpa died; he was the only family she had here in India, but she said she couldn't leave the only place she had ever lived. I sort of understood, but still, I couldn't see leaving Grandma behind when we flew home in a few weeks. The doctors estimated Grandpa only had a week or so left to live on the day we arrived in India four months ago. It was a long flight, and it felt longer because of the nature of our trip. Grandpa only lived for another day after we arrived. We got to say good-bye, and for that, we're all forever grateful. It's almost like Grandpa held on just long enough to see us, like he knew we were coming, and if he just fought a little bit harder and a little bit longer, we would all have so much more peace in his passing than we would have if we didn't get to see him one last time. We were supposed to stay in India for three weeks, but after Grandpa died just two days into the trip, my Dad, sister, and I changed our flights to head home after a week. Mom would stay for the full length of the trip to be with her mom and help her clean out Grandpa's things. Our last trip back to India was sadder than all the others, there's no denying that. There was no sightseeing, no gathering around the dining room table as we feasted on Grandma's cooking. There was no fanfare, no souvenirs, nothing but family and memories.

The cat was a pretty good size, about 40 pounds, and solid black. He gave me quite a start too.  I double checked my daughter to be sure she didn't have a concussion, and decided I had to call animal control. It really saddens me that we are pushing out the wildlife with our greed and selfishness and need to keep on building. Especially in Texas, I notice this happening too much.

I loved the ocean and the white sand.  My kids had a wonderful time at the beach and I had a great time just relaxing myself sipping on a mango margarita. The most memorable experience is that we went to an event at Xcaret, where we attended to a performance about the Mayan Civilization. Our experience at the hotel was also very pleasurable. We had the all-included service and we loved it. Out hotel had 5 different restaurants ( Mexican, American, Chinese, Gourmet, and one with a mixture of all 5).  The service staff was friendly at all times, and we even received tickets for another attraction.  Our vacation in Cancun was the best we have had so far, and it helped us spend time together as a family. Cancun is just like a paradise, it has everything that we needed to have a great time as a family. When I saw my little twin boys smiling and enjoying the attraction I realized that it was an unforgettable experience for all of us. We have been to other places but for some reason we never truly loved the place, there was always something that didn't worked well, but in this case everything went great. I still believe that Cancun has everything that makes an unforgettable experience. I am planing to go back with my husband to celebrate our wedding anniversary (just the two of us) to enjoy a romantic dinner and enjoy the attractions for adults that we did not get to see as a family.", "label": "recalled", "group": "OYWZEVIW"}

Especially when it arrives the day before your birthday and you had big plans. A trip out of time, tickets to a concert and nice hotel room suddenly seemed about as appealing as a plate of rotten fish. My Mom has always been there for me through all my mistakes and failures. Always trying to help, although never really having the right words. But just knowing that at least one person was one my side was usually enough to get me through to the next thing. The card and the note hit me like a train. It didn't really say how serious or treatable the cancer might be. So I was left wondering about her health as I  broke the news to my friend going with me that the trip was off. Although I live a short distance from my parents, I don't go over there anymore because of my father being such a jerk. I got tired of the fighting and insults and vowed to never set foot there again. My brother had wisely made the decision 25 years earlier, so I knew he would have no info either. I was filled with dread and fear as I picked up the phone to call.  They say no news is good news, but not so much when it's your Mom's health. Of course my call goes to voicemail, which further increases my anxiety. The next day my Mom calls me back to say that she has a tumor but they think they will be able to operate and remove it. Fortunately they don't find any cancer in the bloodstream or lymph nodes. Having been through a breast cancer scare with my best friend a year early I knew this was a good sign. Yet still I was mostly paralyzed with a foreboding sense of doom and a real trepidation that my biggest supporter in life might not be around too much longer. As each day ticked off until the operation I could barely think of anything else and could barely get any work done. When it was over, the doctors said that they were very successful in getting the tumor out, and they had no concern that it had spread but chemo would still be necessary.", "label": "recalled", "group": "4OBJDJYT"}

Grandmother spent her whole adult life working in the fabric mills. I really think that's the reason for her breathing problems. All the fine fibers of the cotton and other materials floating around the factory. She worked in a era when not as much was known about safety. There were no breathing masks back in her day. Of course no doctor will sign off on anything like that, but it seems the most likely cause as she's never smoked. She's always eaten healthy and had a big garden as far back as I can remember.

This was totally unexpected, as I hadn't been to a hospital or emergency room in several years.  It didn't start out as a trip to the emergency room, but the urgent care I went to sent me right over!  It happened like this...Two days prior, I had developed a rash on my left forearm.  This was nothing new, as working outside you sometimes end up with all kinds of bruises, bites, scratches and rashes.  What was different this time was on Easter Sunday, I was having a hard time mentally.  I was dizzy, disoriented, having a hard time concentrating, couldn't focus, etc.  My roommate, who had moved in two years prior, was concerned enough to offer to drive me to a doctor, as it was obvious to him that I shouldn't be driving!  After finding one nearby that was open, we headed there, and when we arrived, I was so disoriented I couldn't complete the check-in process, so he gave them my information, and they sent me right over to the emergency room!  There, I was seen almost immediately by a very competent doctor, and had to undergo an EKG and blood draw.  My roommate, knowing that I had a real phobia about needles, stayed by my side the entire time, and even held my hand while my blood was drawn!  I ended up being in the ER for nearly 5 hours!  The doctor diagnosed me with not only a case of shingles, indicated by the rash and associated pain, but also a pretty severe case of low sodium!  I was immediately given anti-virals and pain meds, and the doctor actually told me to eat more salt!  He even suggested I have a bag of chips on the way home! More than anything else that happened that day, the simple acts of kindness and compassion on the part of my roommate made me realize that this was a person who I would be able to count on, probably for the rest of my life, which even with everything going on that day, made me feel very happy and content!", "label": "recalled", "group": "GWSDIH11"}

Initially I was supposed to be in the hospital for only 3 days. This stint in the hospital ended up being for 6 days. The first day I arrived there to stay overnight, the chemo was not ready to be delivered so I had to stay there for the night for really no reason, away from my wife and daughter. The next day I had to get a CT scan that shouldn't have happened and they had initially thought that they found more cancer in my lungs. We now know that this diagnosis is not correct but it added to the trauma of this visit. Several doctors visited us and said that they wanted to potentially open my chest and take a biopsy of my lungs, NOT GOOD! Once my oncologist put the squash on this, they began chemotherapy. As soon as they got me hooked up to the chemo and the pump started moving it into my body, I had a systematic reaction. My throat closed up, my face swelled and went numb and turned purple, and I couldn't breath. They immediately stopped the treatment. Under this terrible stress I no longer wanted to take the treatment. The nurses convinced me otherwise and that I had to take the treatment to fight my cancer so I can still be here for my wife and daughter. So the next morning we tried again with a higher dilution rate and I didn't have a reaction. This was a very emotional moment for me because this chemo was going to keep me alive and kill my cancer. Unfortunately it didn't fully do its job though. I am still fighting cancer because it became resistant to prior treatment methods. We are currently trying MAB treatments to see if we can kill it that way and move onto stem cell transplant. I pray this works. I am 37 and have a wife and daughter that depend on me.

One was a very annoying middle aged woman that insisted everyone learn the \"pre-trip inspection\" the way she was. And finally there was a loud abrasive lady that struggled with memorizing the pre-trip inspection. Of the three instructors that rotated through the students, there was one that honestly didn't even know the pre-trip that well. One older guy that had obviously been teaching it the same exact way for years and a third, more reasonable, instructor that knew it well and was only concerned that you learned it and did not care about what verbiage you used. We all tried to help the loud lady learn the steps of the inspection. I told her to use little memory tricks to remember different things, but the older teacher told me that the only way to be sure to pass was to learn his method and verbiage. The annoying student also insisted this was how the loud lady should learn. Both the annoying student and older teacher quizzed me daily and always pointed out any time I deviated from their method, even if it was technically correct. After the first of two weeks, I had the entire pre-trip inspection memorized in my own way. And honestly, I could even do it with the exact verbiage the older teacher insisted on. However, the loud lady had only memorized maybe a third of it. I worked with her before class and kept telling her to use the memory tricks that worked for her. She started to get it. By my last day of class, she had most of it down. The next day was my CDL test at the Motor Vehicle Division (MVD in Arizona, but DMV everywhere else). I performed the pre-trip for the inspector in my own method with my own verbiage. I used proper wording for different parts and procedures, but not at all in the way the older teacher had insisted. When I had finished, the inspector said, \"I don't usually tell people their score. I just tell them if they passed or not. But you got 100%. You were perfect and I have only ever had 3 people do it perfect. Whatever you did, you did it right\".I found out later that the loud girl did pass her inspection.", "label": "recalled", "group": "JQAYX1K6"}

After she regained consciousness, they ran some test. After the test we had a chat with the doctor. The doctor said he could not really tell us what was going on and we were directed to see a specialist. We met with the specialist and he said he would have to run some test. After the test came the news, the doctor said he suspect it might be cancer. I was shocked and said he had to run some more test to confirm. He made us stay over night to carry out the tests.

This was because the roads were closed because there were some cracks and boulders that needed to be removed. In the evening the lodge was very cozy. However, with such a beautiful view of the sky we ended up chit chatting until 3AM. Our next day was planned to go to Portland and yes we were exhausted but we didn\u2019t really mind.

Most recently was about three months ago. Instead of going to get my pickup truck registration renewed on time or, heaven forbid, early, I dawdled around until the last minute and then managed to FORGET the deadline entirely! End result: my sad truck failed to pass the required emissions test. No big deal, right? Not unless I want to drive the truck anywhere. So now I found myself scrambling trying to find some kind of \"fix this mess\" workaround all the while mentally kicking myself for being such a slacker in the first place. After about 50 phones calls to every friend and FOF (friend of friend) in very high (and a few low) places, I learned quite a lot about emission testing. For starters, new catalytic converters are crazy expensive. Second, you can hack almost anything with the right know-how and equipment ( which almost always includes aluminum foil). It pays to have friends who know stuff. They don't go out of their way to tell you but if you fail, you get one do-over, for FREE! Provided you can find a repair shop that offers one. That involves looking for a teeny-tiny official-looking sticker in the corner of an often very dirty window. So once you find this mechanical get-out-of jail-free card, you still have to pass the test. That's where friends who know stuff come in. The same three things kept coming up:  tires, oil, cold air. That's the ingredients to the motoring magic elixir: Make sure you have your tires at the proper pressure: make sure you have fresh, clean oil: go when they first open so your car is warm and the air temperature is cooler. The hotter the day, the more chance of coughing out some of the bad stuff. Armed with my new oil and freshly-fluffed tires, I was waiting at the bay door when the service center opened for the day. Fifteen easy-peasy minutes later I was motoring on my way to the license bureau with my A-plus grade emission sticker in hand.  The surly, scowling DMV wizards stamped my registration paperwork and now I can legally and safely travel the highways and byways for two more years before I have to go through this process all over again.

I was pretty surprised because I didn't think Mike trusted me that much, but I guess he felt comfortable asking me because he knew I was a parent too. As the cookout started, I began talking to Mike's son and trying to entertain him. It was difficult to keep up with his energy, because he was 7 years old. Kids at that age seem to just have endless amounts of energy and always talk so fast it's hard to get a word in. After about a half hour of talking to his son, I was starting to get a bit bored and stressed. I decided to sneak a beer from the cooler without telling Mike. When I was finished drinking, I felt a lot more at ease and I wasn't getting stressed as much at the task of being responsible for Mike's son.

I don't remember doing this exactly, but according to my other co-workers, I took my shirt off and was running around the backyard pretending to be a unicorn by sticking the can of beer to my forehead and pretending it was my horn I guess. While my coworkers were not amused, Mike's son and all the other kids at the cookout were laughing hysterically at my crazy antics. Unfortunately, I didn't get to taste the burgers that Mike was cooking up the whole time as he unsurprisingly kicked me out. At least I didn't lose my job.", "label": "imagined", "group": "X48MGAHN"}

You never expect this sort of thing to happen to you, but it did. I want to start this by saying I HAVE NEVER BEEN IN A WRECK BEFORE. So I've just spent the last couple of days mentally processing. I think now I'm finally ready to talk about it.  Being on the interstate at night and going the speed limit, I was hit. Not totaled, so that's nice, but it did involve another man and it all happened really suddenly. The impact was enough to get a few dings and scratches, I was coherent for most of it though. The cars weren't great though. Somehow in the midst of stuff I wondered how much it would cost to fix. Did they pay my deductible? I still don't officially know the answer to that question. By the time I was able to get out of my car I saw the guy that had hit me.  He was FREAKING OUT. I was still in shock, I think, but I should probably have been more phased by seeing it than I was. I mean, he had a motorcycle on EACH SIDE OF HIM. There was blood, enough that continuing to take the scene in made me nauseous. I remember the screaming, watching him as I was spoken to by help, I can still see the way his arms looked against them.  I remember when the paramedics came just passing out. Like I was in such shock that I kind of stopped keeping my thoughts together and BOOM out like a light. It was only after the ride to the Hospital and I came to/as they went over the normal stuff that I had thought to wonder where he was. I still picture that scene in my minds eye and get freaked out. I asked how everyone was and they told me they were fine, no serious injuries. I'm nervous about even getting in a car again.

I was completely flummoxed and moved to tears when they pulled into my drive and snaked up its length to park in rows and began unloading building supplies, barbeque grills and coolers.

Several years earlier, she and I had been in a long-term on-again/off-again relationship that had lasted more than a decade.  I moved to Detroit in about 2014, and we lost touch for about four years. However, we reconnected and reconciled in 2018. After reconnecting, we had several conversations in which we discussed how to structure our reconciliation and what our expectations of one another would be. We specifically told one another that we were going to be exclusively dating each other and that we would be trying to take the relationship toward marriage. Anyway, I was staying with her in Los Angeles around Valentine's Day 2019. While we were hanging out one day, I made an off-hand comment about how I had told someone else that my girlfriend and I were in an exclusive committed relationship. Her reaction to my comment was astounding to me. She looked like at me like I had just crapped on the floor when I made that comment. The look one her face was one of pure guilt. She tentatively asked me, \"Did we say that?\" The she backtracked and tried to recover and cover her tracks, but it soon became abundantly clear that she had been seeing other guys and lying to me about her whereabouts. As I questioned her, she denied everything, but her denials became weaker and weaker each time I asked her about it. As I look back on 2018 and 2019, I see so many things that make much more sense if I simply assume that she was just a prolific liar and a cheater. During our relationship, she had always told me about different guys she would hang out with and party with, but she had always assured me that \"they were just friends.\" Now I see that I was a sucker and swallowed one of the oldest lies out there. Anyway, I flew back to Detroit and broke up with her shortly thereafter.

On the wagon ride the guide told us all about the farm and how much water it takes, how many apples they produce, and all sorts of information. After the wagon ride we were able to get lost in the corn maze, they added fun trivia to help point you in the right way this year. Then at the exit we were able to jump on the giant pumpkin pad. We of course gathered a bag of apple to bring home. The kids loved eating the fresh apples instead of bagging them. The little one was able to ride around on my solders while we walked around eating our apples. They also took away the pedal bike races and replaced it with a mine shaft play area where you could purchase bags of sand with gems. To finish up our day we looks at the animals, we saw little pigs, lamas, goats, and lots of other farm animals. We will probably be back again in the next couple weeks to go play for a while. I can not wait to go next year and see what else they add!", "label": "recalled", "group": "IAD0VDPF"}

After a few weeks i remember it was an evening we had taken our supper and we were all seated at the sitting room me, my younger sister,my dad and my mum watching some news on the television. suddenly my younger sister started complaining that she was feeling very cold my dad suggested that she should go and wear another sweater or bring a blanket and cover herself,she did just that and came back later on she started sweating. we were all very scared because she couldn't talk at all. my dad asked me to go and call the ambulance. as i went i found my mother crying not knowing what to do next. i called the ambulance and after some few minutes the ambulance came and she was rushed to the hospital. we were not allowed all of us to board the ambulance so we followed from behind with our vehicle. When we reached the hospital she had been rushed to the emergency room. we were all worried because we had never seen her in such a situation. we waited for almost 45 minutes without hearing a word from the doctors. After some few more years the doctor came out and told us that our sister was in a very delicate state and she had just died. just hearing that my mum fainted and i don't remember what happened next because when i woke up i was lying on the hospital bed. i started crying because i just watched her die without helping her out.. it was a very disturbing moment for me and my family until now we are still mourning", "label": "retold", "group": "7VMD7WO0"}

We all cheer on every kid on the team and celebrate every victory as well as feel every loss. My daughter has been on undefeated teams the past two years which puts  lot of pressure on the girls. This year they were invited to play in a very tough tournament which involved a big time commitment from the players and parents. The first weekend of the tournament was tough with a lot of cheering and yelling and nail biting. The girls won all three games that first weekend putting them in the championship the following weekend. We played the first game and won then lost to a tough team the second game which forced us to play a third game against another team. We won that game at this point everyone was exhausted. We had an hour to get the girls fed and ready for the last game of the tournament against the team that beat us. This would determine who would be champion. We stated the game and it was back and forth hit for hit play for play. Both teams were good! The last inning we start to pull ahead and it starts raining. We had to decide to play or call a hold on the game. Everyone agreed to keep going and the girl played their exhausted hearts out while we cheered and screamed and held our breath on every play. Our last girl was up to bat and she brought two runs in WE WIN!! Every player and parent rushed to the field soaking wet in the middle of the rain cheering and snapping pictures while the girls shook hands with the other team.

I didn't think I could do it. Then, at the fourth month, I caught my stride. Adding an extra mile everyday didn't seem so bad on my body anymore. My lungs didn't burn and I wasn't huffing and puffing. The day finally arrived for the race. It was a chilly morning, but enough to get me energized and to wake up.

Having struggled with the passage of time, and my inexorable march to the grave over much of my adult life, there have been occasions when the clouds have parted, permitting fleeting shafts of light to fall before me. Last month was one of those occasions. That night, my beloved wife took me out for dinner to Poochy's Buffet, my all-time favorite family restaurant. Since we have no kids of our own, we dressed our child-like dolls in their finest embellished tweed jumpsuits and packed them into the back of my 1975 Cutlas Supreme, and away we sped to a very fine dining experience, and nothing more... Or so I thought! When we arrived, we carted our child-like dolls through the entrance of Poochy's Buffet and were asked to be seated against the back wall, as I detest eating with strangers behind me. After situating our child-like dolls on either side of us, and just as I was about to sit, I heard a boisterous commotion and witnessed the waitstaff cascading away in a choreographed series of movements to reveal my entire extended family doing a Russian dance routine and singing Happy Birthday! To me! What a perfect performance! What a perfect way to celebrate another year. Seeing their smiling face-- little Susie, little Tyler, fat Charlie-- it sent chills down my spine. We asked the waiters to push some tables together. I couldn't wait for the gifts, so I didn't let anyone eat until after my presents were opened. This angered the children severely, but it was my special day, not theirs. Afterwards, we all went our separate ways. Me and my wife packed our child-like dolls back into the car and came home.

I loved to wake her up early in the morning and sing her Happy Birthday before the sun had even started to peek over the horizon. \t  Being only August though the countdown for her birthday had not yet begun so my mom decided to try and beat it and get my sisters birthday shopping done early. So one Saturday morning my mom and I went to the mall to shop for my sister. We were at a store shopping for my sister when I saw a bright yellow advertising sign hanging from the ceiling which was an advertisement for Payless, that just happened to be on the opposite end of the mall from where we were. On the sign, there were the coolest slippers I had ever seen. They were massaging slippers in the shape of animals particularly the one on the sign was a pink unicorn. The slippers themselves were pink which made them even greater because that is her favorite color. As soon as I saw these breathtaking slippers I tugged on my mothers' sleeve and pointed at the sign. Without the slightest bit of interest she just merely glanced up at the sign and went back to what she was looking at, so I had kept my eye on that sign for the entire time we were in the store, not acknowledging a word my mom said to me the rest of the time. After my mother had finished and rung her gifts out I tugged on her arm to get her attention and said I had to go across the mall that I would meet her at the car. I hadn't told her what store I was going to or for what but she walked out the exit doors of the mall and I continued on my way to Payless. When I got there I looked around the store feverishly and still couldn't find the slippers I was looking for so I stopped an employee and asked her where they were. She pointed me in the direction of the far back of the store so I took off for that corner and when I got there I saw a pile of boxes with unicorn heads sticking out of them. So then I looked through the boxes for her size and when I found them I brought them up and paid for them and ran to the mall exit hoping I hadn't detained my mother in the car for too long. When I got there she had asked me what was in the bag and I showed her, she smirked and burst out laughing and offended I asked her what was so funny because I knew my sister would love them. She smiled and explained that my other sister had bought her a massaging neck warmer that was in the shape of a unicorn and was pink and she said that only sisters could pick out a perfect pair without even knowing what the other had  gotten.", "label": "recalled", "group": "9S2BIDXJ"}

He had been sick for a few days, but on a Tuesday in the early evening everything quickly spiraled out of control. My mom called my husband and asked him to hurry over to the house because she thought something was wrong with my dad. He went over there and my dad was not doing well at all. He didn't know his name, where he was at and who my mom or my husband were. My mom immediately called 9-1-1. When the ambulance got there they immediately checked my dads vitals and got him loaded to rush to the hospital. They took him to the intensive care unit and got him hooked up to a million different machines to see if they could figure out what was going on with him. By this time it was late into the night on Tuesday. We were all sitting in the waiting room until more information was known. It was a very long night of millions of tests and no answers. Finally early in the morning on Wednesday a doctor came out and told my mom that my dad was suffering of kidney failure. We were all in shock because he hadn't been sick long at all. We asked what we could do and the doctor said it was too late too do anything and that if they even tried to operate he would die. The doctor could not give us a timeline of how long he would live, but that it wouldn't be more than six weeks. Well, it turns out it would be even sooner than that. By early the next morning my dad had passed away. We were all in shock because there hadn't been any warning signs and just a week ago he had been happy and hanging out with us.

It costs money just to travel there and have the outfit. And I don't like it there nor do I like the people. I look back on my time there as struggle and pain. But I looked at Facebook the morning of graduation and there was a small pain. Seeing two of my almost friends in their caps and gowns, with their families made me slightly sad for what I didn't have. Finishing didn't feel like a celebration and maybe had I gone I could have made it be one. They had been through struggles similar to mine and they were there, in the gowns, celebrating. I could have gone and seen them off, and gave that university and city where I spent so many years of my life a proper goodbye. So I sat there, looking at Facebook, thinking about how the last time I left I didn't know it was going to be the last time. I realized that part of why I hadn't wanted to go was because most of my friends had graduated years before and I wasn't really close to anyone else. Dragging them back for my graduation wasn't something I felt comfortable doing. And I realized that somewhere deep inside I had seen myself being dragged into graduation, begrudgingly going. But people had listened when I said no. Facebook, ignoring privacy as usual, alerted one of my almost friends I was online. She sent me message asking where I was and if we could meet to take photos together. When I told her I was not there she expressed disappointment. She wrote me a message about how sad it was to not see me as she saw me as directly responsible for her even making it to graduation. At the same time, other almost friends who had graduated previously were online congratulating the two. Upon seeing I was online, they wrote to me as well. One expressed congratulations to me and spoke of how she was glad I was finally free. The other spoke of how we would celebrate in the future, as I had celebrated her graduation with her and she could not have gotten through without me. And I told myself that I didn't need to be at that graduation because I had what I needed from it--the people who understood how much it took and the feeling of being free of it.", "label": "recalled", "group": "MSSWSYJ4"}

She mumbled something when I hugged her which I took to be recognition that she knew who I was and was glad to see me. Over the course of the next few days, she was very weak and completely out of it.

On the last day I was there, she was so strong and cogent that in a totally impromptu moment during a conversation about how she should write a poem about her situation to help cope, she made up an entire poem in her head. She wasn't strong enough to write, so she had me transcribe it and it was amazing.

We left the restaurant after finishing our meals and saw a food truck selling ice cream across the street. We decided to get ice cream cones for dessert. We walked about for a bit while we ate our ice cream and chatted about different things. About an hour later, we found the perfect spot on the grass near a bridge with an open view of the sky. My friend made a comment that it would be the perfect spot to stay and watch the fireworks. I agreed and we sat down and waited for the show to start. After the fireworks show was over, we all went home. I felt so happy that my friend wanted to share that holiday with me and it made my entire day so much better.

This is something we were not able to agree upon, and we knew that we both needed a lawyer. I had a feeling that this was going to be a nasty battle between us. Unfortunately, I was correct, the battle ended up being drawn out for three years. By this time the kids actually became of legal age to decide where they wanted to stay. To my surprise our children decided that they wanted to stay with me. Come to find out their mother had started seeing another mate who were abusive towards my Ex and our children. He had a drinking problem, and became violent when he drank. Our children have fond memories of when me and my Ex were together, and knew what a normal household would run like. The case was drawn out over the three years due to lack of proof showing that my Ex was an unfit mother and having an unstable household for our children to reside full time in. During those three years I worked on purchasing a home, and I thought it was necessary to remain single during this time. I felt my children did not need their dad to get into a relationship whenever they already had enough stress on their shoulders. I remember the day like yesterday whenever we were at court, and it was proved that my Ex was not only an unfit mother, but was unable to provide a stable home environment. Also, on top of everything our children each confessed to the courtroom how they prefer to reside in my home due to the hostile environment that they were encountering between my Ex and her new mate. They confessed how this was affecting them in school as well with their social lives.

This oil painting was truly beautiful and caught my eye due to the colors and uniqueness of the birds. Looking deeper into the painting were details that didn't originally catch my eye, and that I had to look for. That being said, there were watermelons actually painted in between the birds in this painting! That being said, colors had a big influence on how my eye caught these details. The colors red, orange, yellow, deep blue and purple; it gave off a warmth feeling of harmony. I believe there is a reason why the artist choose these colors after staring at the painting for so long and my theory comes down to this: I believe that due to the amount of scattered birds in this picture, the artist wanted to balance this by carefully choosing which colors to incorporate into this painting without taking away the uniqueness of the painting. As far as shape goes, the lines formed by the artist is what makes the shape of the painting; mainly targeting the birds and the hard-to-miss details of the melons in between. The texture in this painting is oily (which is ironic considering it is an oil painting), but the details such as the feather bumps and circles make it as if the birds were rough and bumpy. Then on the other hand you have a bunch of shrubbery in all the possible spaces where there wasn't a bird placed. The shrubbery makes you feel as if you were to get poked by touching this painting, just like as if you were about to touch a cactus. Finally we have the last element of art; Value. Value is the illusion portrayed by the artist by using different shades and tones of light in the painting. Since this painting is very cluttered and there are so many details to be contributed in this piece, we can see that the value of light used in this painting was strong due to the colors used in the painting as well.  Overall, the trip to the Detroit Institute of Art museum was an experience that I previously wasn't planning on going on, anytime in the near future; but I'm glad I took this opportunity to look at different works of art and to analyze paintings using what I've learned from this course. It was a great opportunity to look at beautiful expressions that the artists portrayed using something as simple as oil pastels, like Sissan\u2019s did while painting Fowl and Melons.", "label": "recalled", "group": "TOW3MLLR"}

It was a truly unfortunate situation, as he was simply driving down the street to the grocery store just half mile away from home. He didn't need to go out that night. He was minding his own business when a drunk driver struck him head on and killed him. The other driver walked away unscathed. The circumstances of the crash had us all really searching for greater meaning to why terrible things happen to otherwise good and undeserving people. We decided to get together to mourn collectively after a few months had passed thinking it would help us all move forward with our lives. We couldn't seem to shake the sheer random nature of such unfortunate violence and it helped to commune and speak about how his passing had affected us and our hopes, views, and beliefs. We resolved to meet together once a year to honor Dino's memory, and to examine how we are all doing existentially. We hope that continuing to meet will become a tradition that takes on even greater meaning as the years go by. It can grow to become a gathering that none of us would dare miss, no matter how far away from each other we find ourselves. The group can even grow and take on new members who never knew Dino. To dream even larger about the potential of this event, it could even become a broader community celebration of those who were once close to us but have since passed. I hope this dream can come to fruition. I hope many community members find that they can benefit from such reflection. I hope I can find solace in the comfort of my friends and neighbors. I hope it becomes something really cool and something we can be proud of. I hope I hope I hope.", "label": "imagined", "group": "NR4O42LU"}

They originally decided to move to Texas in 8 months and we planned around that date. However, at some point they decided that they had to move sooner. They said it was because of an offer they got on their house and they really didn't want to miss the opportunity to sell above market value. The problem is this was a very difficult position for me because I was budgeting to have enough money to move in eight months. When they moved up the date, I began panicking because I would not be able to afford to move to Texas with them and I would have no where to live if I stayed here. The whole situation turned out to be a really big strain not just on me but on my relationship with my parents. Having no choice but to move with them in a month and a half turned my life upside down. I turned to a friend of mine who I knew I could trust and I asked them what I should do. My friend told me I should make a decision based on reason and logic. He suggested I write down a list of all of the options I have and the pros and cons of each. That way, I could visualize the problem and have a better chance of making the right choice. By approaching it like a math problem and adding up the option with the most pros, I was able to make an informed decision. Even after using this strategy, I still took several nights to sleep on my decision just to make sure it was what I wanted to do. In the end, I decided to move with my parents and leave everything behind for a fresh start in Texas.", "label": "imagined", "group": "8DE9OEEJ"}

My mother and I noticed that it seemed like he was getting out of breath more easily, and it seemed like his skin was always very red.

They scheduled surgery for next month, and the entire family is very stressed out at the thought. My father has been forced to quit working temporarily in order to not aggravate the condition before the surgery. We are all very nervous because the surgeons told us there is a somewhat significant chance the operation could kill my father.

She had finished her first year of high school, and was starting her second.  She had changed quite a bit since I had last seen her earlier in the year.  She stood up straighter when she walked, and was more serious, in her face and the way she talked.  She seemed much more like a young adult than the child I had known for so many years.  She had her cellphone, and used it adeptly, like it was never difficult to learn.  She spoke more slowly and more eloquently, and I was able to have conversations about more serious topics with her.  As I talked to her that day, I wondered what she would be like as a 25 year-old adult in 10 years.  I wondered what her career would be, and if she would be married by that age.

We spent two days just visiting The Louvre. The Mona Lisa was just as enigmatic and interesting as I imagined her being. We went up the Eiffel Tower and surveyed the glittering city below us. We went to so many adorable little cafes and bakeries that I lost count. We went to the Notre Dame Cathedral, which was immense and breathtaking. I couldn't believe I was stepping through the halls of a building that was constructed over 1000 years ago. America isn't even 1000 years old so I've never been in a building that old. We also saw the Sacre-Couer, which is a basilica I had never even heard of before my visit to Paris, but it was an extremely beautiful, gleaming white church. I've always heard Parisians have a reputation for being a little cold and snobbish, but I did not get that impression at all. Everyone was so nice! I practiced my rudimentary French the whole time, and no one said anything rude to me. Several people did kind of smile and insist on speaking English to me, but I get that. It's obviously not easy to communicate with someone speaking very broken French to you.

I had to explain to him, about her heart failure when she received her MMR and her pacemaker and how it malfunctioned and had to be turned off. She is 17. He still loves her but now she's terrified. It happened to her again when she tried to have a dentist fill this same tooth, only worse. She passed out came to and passed out over and over, while her eyes shook and her mouth foamed. The ER could find no reason for it. Now I have to take her to a new dentist to get it fixed. My daughter does not want to be dependent at her age, but she has to depend on me, as I have to be with her when medical procedures are performed on her. She will try nitrous oxide this time, for her dental work and we're praying it works to help her remain calm and conscious for her dental work on Friday. Parents are important especially mothers. I feel needed and have to walk a fine line between giving her freedom to live her own life while staying there for her when she desperately needs physical and emotional support.", "label": "recalled", "group": "VB0JI5RM"}

Since you're likely also surrounded by people you have things in common with, it's not all that surprising that people fall in love at work. A work spouse relationship is born, where you share the trials and tribulations of the workplace with each other, have lunch together, and emotionally depend on one another. In other cases, the people involved may not have put strong boundaries in place, and they can start to behave inappropriately.         But it's how you handle this attraction that's important. If you're not careful, the situation can fall into the realm of micro-cheating, which is essentially where you cheat, but only a little bit. we had a wonderful memories over the past week. it was awesome. we took a lot of picture.", "label": "recalled", "group": "VUGAX0WZ"}

Three days after my birthday my husband said we were going to our marina to spend the night on our boat.  He told me to dress up though in case I wanted to go out to dinner or something.  I thought it was odd but I dressed up anyway and when we got to the marina there were more cars there than usual and I started seeing familiar faces and realized it was a surprise party for me.  I can't even express the happiness I felt.  I had never in my life have anyone give me a surprise party.  It was my daughter who had planned it and to this day I can't figure out how they kept it a secret.  My co-workers were there, my family and my friends.

A year ago, I was discovering my brother's cancer diagnosis and doing soul searching. I treated him so horribly when he was sick, I was a real asshole.

I wouldn't. We worked on our relationship and I supported him like I should have. It came up that he needed a bone marrow match. I immediately sent off my swabs, but it took almost 2 months to hear back. We were a match. We underwent the process and the doctor says I helped saved my brothers life. He has a real fighting chance now. We sobbed together. Reflecting on this year, I really got my act together.

I saw a few kids on a boogie board in the water and laughed to myself because I thought about how they might get caught in an undertoe or get eaten by sharks.  It was surprising because it is a rare site in New Hampshire as the water is always too cold to see animals up close. I continued walking and we happened upon several small tidal pools which felt really warm when I stepped in them.  They were in front of a bunch of rocks.

She spent about an hour there checking it out. About an hour after leaving her realtor called and they put a cash offer on my house that I could not refuse. Because she was a cash buyer the sale of the house was scheduled within 3 weeks of signing the agreement. I went from casually looking for a house to 3 weeks out from the sale. I had to quickly find a rental while I look for my new house. It took me almost 10 days to find a place that I wanted to sign a lease for but I did end up finding one.

We had spent about five hours in the late afternoon looking before it got dark and we decided to head home. We were driving thru a town next to the park called 29 Palms that has a marine base in it when we saw a UFO from the car! It was a long bright light in the sky that was out in the desert. We pulled over and started to film the object and talk about what it was. It didn't seem to move much in the air and didn't seem far away. My Girlfriend was driving and figured we might be able to get closer to it (we were about a mile away) so we drove down some streets to get to it. We were able to drive right up too it and film it for about 25 minutes. The light looked like a long glowing ribbon in the sky that made no noise. It was very windy but was able to control itself against the wind and would lift up into the sky a few hundred feet and come back down less then one hundred feet about our heads. Many other people started to stop and see the UFO. After close to 30 minutes since we originally saw the object it started to move away from up and against the wind making us get back in our cars and drive another street over to it. As we pulled up we saw the item come down to the ground and turn off. Myself, my Friend and 9 other people that stopped to see the UFO all ran out of our cars and into the desert to look for it, but we couldn't find it at all. We couldn't figure out where it went or what it was. The most likely explanation was it was a light up tail of a kite or a rope on a drone but it made no noise so drone is out, if it's a kite where was the guy holding it? They had to have seen all these people stopped on the side of the road looking and running into the desert to find it. There are some powerlines that cross between where we stood under the object and where it came down so that's not safe and how did it not get stuck? I have tried looking for the object online but can't find anyone selling anything similar to it and the videos online do not look like my video or the object we saw. On the drive home I uploaded the video I took of the UFO, now most of my videos are of animals so this one was a little out of place but by morning had thousands of people emailing, messaging,  commenting on the video asking questions trying to figure it out. A number of large UFO and paranormal Youtubers reached out to me to use the footage on their shows and podcasts! It was really cool and a lot of fun and I was asked to be interviewed for a show on the travel channel which I did and was also a lot of fun.", "label": "recalled", "group": "LG19JIEQ"}

Although he has been experimenting with drugs, mainly smoking marijuana, he did not develop a serious addiction until he moved from our home in Florida to Chicago. There he became intimate with a meth dealer and got so deep in addiction that he lost his job and then his apartment and for most of the remainder of his time in Chicago he was virtually homeless, sleeping on friends' couches and occasionally in the park. Last November my husband and I helped him come back to Florida, thinking it was his best chance to get clean. Unfortunately, in our hometown meth, my son's drug of choice, seems to be available on every corner and in every bar. He would manage to not use for a few days and then would jump right back in, sometimes for days at a time. On at least one occasion he stayed up using meth and other substances for a straight seven day period. In April his addiction reached critical mass and he attempted suicide in his desperation. A good friend of his, a recovering alcoholic himself, helped my son get into a detox facility in a nearby town and then to their rehab center. After that he lived for a few months in a recovery home and has done very well since. Three weeks ago, his half bother on his dad's side of his family hung himself and did not survive. My son was devastated as they were very close. He handled it extremely well but I was concerned that this tragic even could trigger a relapse. Shortly after that his roommate ended up in the hospital with liver problems. Last week he called me and told me that he had indeed relapsed, but that, thankfully, it was a one time event and was not his usual meth, but cocaine. He also reached out to his sponsor and to his counselor at the rehab center. Even though he did relapse I was not devastated or overly disappointed as I would have been in the past. Relapse is a common thing in drug and alcohol recovery and he had some serious triggers confront him in a short period of time. I told my son not to beat himself up over his relapse and stressed how proud I was of the way he handled it. To the best of my knowledge he has continued to go to meetings and maintain close contact with his sponsor. He is dealing with his relapse in all the right ways and I have every reason to believe he will pick himself  up and start over on the path to recovery he had already set for himself.", "label": "recalled", "group": "LSEWZS7A"}

We must have played until at least five in the morning when the last of us had finally dozed off. The next day we were up early for the weeding and we had to scatter back to our places to get ready.  The wedding was was outdoors at a local winery.  It was such a nice morning and it felt good to breathe in the fresh air. The ceremony was simple and everyone was elated.

Once the show started, they started getting loud, heckling the comedians, have loud conversations amongst themselves, and interrupting the show over and over. My friends on stage were struggling to keep the show going and not lose the audience by being too hard on them. I was finally fed up and yelled out for them to shut up. This caused a chain reaction where other frustrated audience members started yelling at them, confrontations between other audience members and them, some of the other comedians trying to hget them to leave and then finally the show runner came to ask them to leave. The main ringleader was wearing a pirate hat and refused to go after his friends did. He would start feigning falling over into the chairs when my friend touched his arm, and getting in front of the stage and shouting so that no one could move on.

Hey! Vina is a friend app that acts a lot like Tinder. You set your preferences for what city you\u2019re in and age limits, and then you swipe left for \u2018I\u2019ll pass\u2019 and right for \u2018I\u2019d like to be friends, maybe.\u2019 If you both swipe right on each other, then you match and you can send messages about meeting up.

Secondly, once we did find each other, it quickly became apparent that she was very, very sick. Like, coughing every three seconds and eyes red sick. While we ordered some coffee and found a seat, I tried to be sympathetic to her apologies for being sick, but I couldn\u2019t focus on what she was saying between all the coughing. I hardly drank my coffee because I didn\u2019t want to get sick. It was honestly a shame because Ruth was probably a very interesting person and we seemed to like some similar things.

I had read it before, but it didn't affect me the way it did a week ago. It was really touching, and really moved me. It said that I must adorn myself with righteousness. Righteousness, what's that supposed to mean, and why does it matter? Well, to be righteous tells us that we have to do the right thing ... to have good behavior. It does not mean that you have to be perfect. I caught myself crying, because for my journey so far, I have been so fixated on speaking the word of the Lord exactly as he said it. I was worried that if it wasn't exactly right, my students wouldn't buy into the story. But I was wrong... It's not about being perfect and just like the Lord. Only He can do that. It's about doing my best to teach others so that they can receive His love too, by following his teachings.", "label": "imagined", "group": "JS4YKFEN"}

She was a small baby herself when I birthed her, but this child of her's, this baby boy was just the cutest you'd ever seen. He was long, lanky and absolutly screaming when he arrived. There were four generations in the room that day. Great grandmom, Grandmom, me and my husband, her parents, her younger brother, husband and her step kids. So many people. But it was so worth the wait of this baby bundle. She was such a trooper, all the pain was taken in stride as we all took turns holding my daughters hand and helping her through it all. I just can't imagine everything that was going through her mind. I know when I was giving birth to her I was thinking about everything I'd teach this precious child. Maybe that was happening throughout the whole ordeal. I know she'll make the best mother ever, and this child will be the luckiest child to have such a loving mother. My daughter was the most loving daughter there was for me, I can only imagine just how much joy that son will bring her. She's such an amazing woman.", "label": "retold", "group": "DOSBZX6M"}

It began with just one unit, which was the downstairs unit, then the bedroom unit began to leak a few days later, which made the most damage of the leaks.  Initially, I thought it was just filters that were giving the units trouble, as previously I had decided to clean the filter in my bedroom unit.  I felt the unit was not blowing the air consistently as before, so I decided to clean it and then it began to blow like normal.  The water leaking, however was not going to be an easy fix. I didn't want to buy new units or pay for service. I just assumed the leaking was from overrunning, heat moisture, etc and allowed it for about a week.  Almost two weeks and a half had went by and I came home one day and the unit in my bedroom had been leaking water all over the room.  I have a suitcase and some important boxes next to the unit that were damaged but certainly able to be replaced. When the cleaning of the filters didn't work, I had to think of another plan. I researched some common causes for the leaking, as many of those who had experienced the same trials, all mentioned that the units have to be cleaned at intervals.  The units began to hold alot of matter that clogs the drain up, that don't allow for adequate flow of any moisture that forms.  Believing I researched enough, I decided to break the units down and clean them myself, as well as the filters.  The units have been working properly the last few days and no more leaking.

That was one of the best decisions I have ever made. 2019 was a rather rough year for us though. It tested us in ways that I never thought would be possible. About six months ago, I was laid off from my current job due to \"budget cuts.\" The lay off came out of nowhere and I was under the impression that I was secure in my job. I was devastated about it and it sent me into a depression over the following weeks. The depression continues to get worse because I was struggling to find another job. It got so bad, to the point where I wouldn't even get out of bed some days. I was a mess. Nothing was getting done around the house and the clutter was just making me feel worse about the entire situation. My husband quickly noticed. Normally, he is this stone cold guy, who rarely shows affection or his emotion. However, over this course of that week, my husband pulled out all the stops to get me out of my funk. He would come home from work and draw me a bubble bath and immediately begin dinner. There were even a few occasions that week where he would bring home flowers and a nice card for no reason at all. He left me sticky notes with little affirmations about how much he loved me and how amazing I was all over the house. He even did the dishes a few times, the right way. Not once did he make me feel bad about not being able to find a new job after the layoff. I knew he was stressing out about it, but he never let on that he was stressed at all.

I guess I got lucky, because I had doubled my money! Then it tripled! It was like a dream come true. I had enough to make the down payment on the house, but then I got thinking.

While it was difficult to be too surprised at this result, he had seemed to be doing well and living a good life, and the hope was that he was on the road to recovery. Unfortunately this was not to be the case.   One thing that both me and my dad as well as him and his dad had in common was our love of golf.  It was something that we often did together and had taken numerous golfing vacations together.  These trips had become a highlight of the year for all involved and something to look forward too.  My dad works for a healthcare company that specializes in cancer treatments and as long as he has been working there we had played in a golf tournament that helps to sponsor families that are fighting cancer and does such things as send kids to a summer camp or pay for a day at an amusement park.  Something that will allow the family to enjoy their time together and get away from the fight against cancer for awhile and feel like a normal family.  There is one hole that is called the dedication hole.  It is where you write a name down of someone who has been effected by cancer in your life and every member of the group tees off at the same time.  When we pulled up to the tee box my friend got very emotional and began to cry.  Looking back it makes complete sense that he would feel this way, but I just hadn't thought of it as he is someone who almost always keeps his emotions close to his chest.  In turn the rest of the group became emotional as we have all been friends for more than 15 years.  We all wrote down his dad's name on our balls and gave them to him after the round.  While the whole day was fun and we all had a blast at this moment we all felt the gravity of what our friend had gone through and it made us closer as a group.", "label": "retold", "group": "E12503PP"}

We walked for hours in the slightly hilly area of our local state park. We saw turtles, frogs, and bunnies. We each almost slipped a few times. But we were wearing shoes with traction, so that helped prevent any falls. There was a spot at which I felt we were walking in an enchanted forest. There was a tiny cabin in the distance, a wooden bridge over a small creek, and very high trees. I could almost imagine the smell of pies being baked and the story of Hansel and Gretel in the forest. I got some bug bites but had a balm that helped prevent the bites from getting irritated. My husband was got bitten more than me, but he didn't complain. My husband is funny as he tried to scare me for fun. He said stuff like, \"I saw someone stare at us and hide.\" Or, \"What was that? There's a Sasquatch over there. Careful!\" Then he would tap one of my shoulders and made me jump. When we were done hiking we had a picnic. We brought sandwiches, water, celery sticks, trail mix, and fig cookies. It all tasted very good and we went home feeling refreshed from our time in nature.

I love tacos as it is but the ones in Mexico were so much better than any I've had before. I know some people say driving to Mexico isn't worth it and that it's better to fly but being able to see the country through the drive was great. Of course the food on the way was great too. My children enjoyed it as well, although they were complaining any time we weren't stopped to eat. If I had to do it again I would probably choose to fly but I have no regrets about the road trip this time. My husband's parents welcomed us with love when we got there.

He did, however, show up to see the kids in a 2019 Cadillac that he could afford. In addition to this, he was arrested for drug trafficking when they raided his house and they ended up seizing the house and allowing him out on bond. At this point, he got arrested again eight days later for dealing drugs in another county. They also released him on bond. Then ten days after that, he was pulled over and arrested again for driving on a suspended license and drug trafficking again. At this point, he is denied bond, so I can not get my money or any child support from him.  He can't seem to pay me, but the payments on his new car are still being made. In addition to this, he has managed to pay for a personal attorney in all of his cases. He has also paid for a different lawyer to try to get him bond, but if he gets bond, I know he will not end up paying me. As of this point, all of my joy over him being required to finally do something for his children has been squashed by the fact that he will not be paying us anything. The only thing that I have to be happy about the situation is that I know that he will not die because of drugs, and he will not be around my children, making their lives miserable. They won't have to see him constantly on drugs or be disappointed in him any more than they already are. So unless he is granted bond, I am forced to cut my losses. The only way I can do anything further is if he is able to get bonded out of jail.", "label": "retold", "group": "NUU56XP8"}

I would have written about it sooner, but I needed time to process my thoughts about the event, because it was somewhat traumatic.  Now that some time has passed, I think I have enough perspective to talk about it and express how I feel. Three months ago, I wrecked my beautiful truck.  I was coming home from work after the late shift, and it was raining.  I was going down New Road  about 11pm.  I rounded a corner, and there were four deer in the road.  I know right, my greatest fear when driving home at night.  I swerved to miss the deer, which I did successfully, but I went into a spin on the slick wet road.  I slid completely off the roadway and ran into a tree.   Fortunately, I had my seat belt on, because I hit the tree head on.  The airbags deployed and the seat belt did it's job, and I was only shaken up.  The truck was completely totaled and I was so upset about this.  I worked so hard for that truck and I just couldn't believe that God would let this happen to me.   I was upset for weeks.  The insurance did replace the truck, but it just wasn't the same. Now, after several weeks have passed, I realized how ungrateful I was in being upset about the truck.  The important thing is that I walked away completely unhurt.  Not even a scratch.   Trucks you can replace, but I was really fortunate that night. I am going to make a huge effort in the future to be grateful for the important things in life, and care less about the material things.", "label": "imagined", "group": "AO61DQH8"}

Turns out, walking your dogs in the woods can be far more than you expected. In reality, this walk in the woods turned out to be a 2 1/2 hour endeavor. How could a seemingly innocent walk in the woods with your fur family members become an elongated process? Well.., when you decide to check out new paths and different areas you can REALLY become lost in the woods. Trees start to become the same, especially here in the Maine where we are called \"The Pine Tree State\". That's really all you see-- pine trees mixed with scant hardwood forest species (once pine trees take over an area the forest floor soil becomes acidic making it harder for other trees to propagate) and patches of shrubs in open areas. Where I live in particular is hilly and did I mention has many trees? I eventually found myself in new territory with my dogs, and confused about which direction home was in. This confusion kept hitting me for about an hour and a half, walking back and forth continuously coming back to an area. The final time I came back to this area in the woods, I noticed something unusual, numerous letter 'P's or '9's hanging from small tree branches, made of felt material. It was very odd to see, as there were at least a dozen or more hanging in this small area off these one or two trees and their numerous small branches. I immediately took that as a sign from where I was standing in relation to these letters/numbers, I had to go in the westerly direction. After walking for what felt like an eternity, my dogs and I finally noticed familiar territory! We were approaching our home, and made it home safe despite being dehydrated and wiped out (covered in ticks no less).

It was closed, so pulled out her (super-old) spare, and while everyone else figured out how to change it , I held very angry cat in the hopes that he wouldn't run away whenever someone opened a door. I did nothing to help change the tire, and I got an adorable picture out of it.  I had the drill thing (still don\u2019t even know what it's called) and lots of patience. I got the tire off and went to go get the spare, which I did not know how to get on, and the tire that I had left upright rolled down into the woods.

Vaping helps to calm me down during stressful time. It also relaxes me when im not stressed. Although I enjoy vaping, at times it can be expensive. I was amazed when I read the article about making your own. It seemed really simple to do. All the ingredients were cheap. Also all the ingredients were easy to obtain. I immediately saved the page and made the list. I proceeded to go to the store for the items. The ingredient list was simple and short. I was more shocked that the total cost was less than expected. I carefully followed the instructions and made a batch. I was surprised at how well it turned out. It ended up being better than expected. It was great to get the desired effects at a savings. I highly recommend this for anyone who vapes. It's a real cost savings.", "label": "imagined", "group": "Z8J3S2DC"}

It felt painful to send her away for a 6 hour school day. I wondered if she was happy, listened to, understood,  if she was hungry for a snack that she was accustomed to having, if she made friends, who she played with at recess, etc. I kept busy at home with my younger daughter,  but our routine was fractured. My daughter was missing her big sister,  and I was missing my big girl who helped me with her little sister.  During the first week of school, I reminded myself that this was my big girl's new chapter in life, her journey to growing into a big kid. This right of passage was to be expected,  and that we all have survived without our parents watchful eyes. I found it interesting that we spend so much of our child's early years carefully watching over them, only to have to release that nurturing grip to a stranger. As funny as it sounds, I had think back to my years in elementary school. I considered what my parents had to do, releasing my care to strangers, and it helped me bridge this new chapter that I was on the other end with my child. I was able to better prepare my child and myself for this new schedule. The daily pep talks calmed my inner mama bear. I no longer fought with anticipation to camp out at her school, just a good joke to remind myself that she was fine and I would be as well. Now that she is 3 months into this new routine, we are satisfied, she is in love with her school, and I feel like the competent mama bear that I knew I would be.", "label": "retold", "group": "WHEX370A"}

I was surprised at how big she was since she was supposed to be very small. She handed her to me and she got to lay on my chest.

It was a nightmare in the restaurant , a gory scene. And soon after I started to regret every of my actions. I thought to myself, if you had just walked away it wouldn't have gotten to this. The restaurant owner called the medics and was reluctant on calling the cops on me. Soon as the medics arrived, I got into the van with them and I was also saparated from my dog. I guess they too him to animal control. In the hospital, the doctors carried out x-rays and ran some tests on my ex boyfriend. He had a lot of open wounds so he had to get stitches and one of his fingers was also broken, so they got that fixed up also.

My wife and I were finally moving out of the apartment we shared for over 7 years and were ready to make a change. We had an extremely small place we were going to move into on some families lot just to hold us over. We planned on living there for a bit, saving a bunch of money, and doing other things like travel and a search for long term housing options in the meantime. Well, the option on the families lot fell through with less than a month to move out from our apartment. The next day, a young woman who had recently moved into our complex was having a party outside. 1 of her male friends came to visit and partake in the party. He offered my wife and I a place to park a travel trailer on his lot, for incredibly cheap and also have access to a house. This is where everything started to go downhill. My wife started to disappear, sometimes for 2 days at a time during the move out process, leaving me feeling responsible for it all. So, it's the end of April, our lease is up April 31st, and we're finally moving out after purchasing a travel trailer. We end up on the lot, it's in a very seedy neighborhood, but it's nice enough. We have full access to a home, our trailer, and now a yard. I slowly but surely start to see my wife starting to form an emotional affair right before my eyes with the male roommate. We were in a bit of a rough patch, but nothing unworkable in my eyes. She's still disappearing with him in his car, sleeping away from me, becoming extremely distant, indifferent, and all around completely out of her character. To cut the story short as it honestly is deeply upsetting me, June 2nd rolls around and as she's getting out of the shower after avoiding me like a plague, she tells me she no longer wants to try in our relationship. 8.5 years treated like a tissue that can just be thrown away.

I believed in what I did and I was proud no matter the outcome. I even did some crowdwork and I made the audience laugh on several occasions. After the performance was over, the audience clapped and cheered as the host held his hand over each individual comedian, signaling how much they liked each person\u2019s material and presentation.

I hadn\u2019t expected to win or even to do really well, but just to pursue something I\u2019d wanted to do for a long time and I wanted to share my material that I believed in. I was awarded the cash prize and several other comics and audience members approached me after the show and asked me to be on their podcasts, perform at other shows/spaces, and what my writing process was. I was so honored and the feeling of adrenaline kept me up almost all night long.

In the afternoon she called my boyfriend and told him that during the trip his eyes were still burning and that when he got home he checked the liquid in his glasses and it smelled like Clorox, so he had to discard it, that She believed that it was I who was doing all this for evil. My boyfriend talked to me and told me that we weren't going to be able to stay together for what I was going through. My reaction was to cry and tell him that I could not live without him not telling me that I would never do that to her. My boyfriend was incredulous at the beginning he asked me many questions and in the end it seems he believed me. The next one, my boyfriend's daughter called him and told him that his laptop had been damaged and that when he took it to the technician he told him that the circuits had burned because he had poured water on her, according to her this was the proof that indeed I I was intentionally hurting him. My boyfriend told his daughter that he didn't believe her and her reaction was to block his phone and not talk to him for a week. My boyfriend in the face of that pressure decided to tell him that I had already gone back to my home country, and with this the girl spoke to her father again. Now every time she returns to visit her father, I must go with all my personal things to spend these days with my boyfriend's mother.", "label": "imagined", "group": "IZ5ZDTHI"}

I was hooked up to multiple machines and given medication to make labor move along more quickly.

I opted for the epidural and when I was given the medication My blood pressure dropped so low instantly I passed out. When I woke I was surrounded by hospital staff and being given multiple medications. A few hours after this it was time for delivery and I succesfully and safely delivered 2 babies with no surgical intervention. We stayed in the hospital for several days. The twins needed a little extra help to ensure they were going to be ok with eating and gaining weight. Even though baby B was a footling breech delivery she was perfect and healthy. The hospital staff treated them like little celebrities because there had never been a natural twin birth in that hospital before and they were all in awe of the babes.

As the drinks came in, her step-dad and friend of the family began to talk about their experiences with certain issues in their lives. Her step-dad's friend talked about his experience with severe anxiety and panic attacks, along with depression. I was surprised, because he was so extroverted, cool to be around, and happy-looking. I explained that I too suffer from these conditions, and that although I am on medication and receiving Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, I was still struggling but getting much better. He was a little surprised but was very supportive and explained that he has been in therapy for years, and has been doing amazing since he started therapy. For once, I was finally able to connect with someone in her family. I find it hard to enter conversations because they speak french, and I'm mostly English, so this felt nice. Meanwhile, my girlfriend is drinking and becoming more talkative. We looked at each other at one point and apologized, we kissed, and instantly felt better about that morning's fight. The food arrived, and we were all eating, talking, sharing stories and laughs. After the restaurant, we went to an ice-cream place and I got my favorite ice-cream cone: Soft serve vanilla ice-cream dipped in cookies-n'-cream. It was to die for. Afterwards, the family friends returned to their homes, and we went back to her mother's place. We spent the night playing games with my girlfriends younger siblings.

We started on the North side of the lake, and geared up at the local information center to ensure we had the proper route. After packing up supplies and filling our water bottles, we began our trek in the early hours of the morning. Weaving through paths along one of the most beautiful lakes in the country was a blast, and we often decided to stop and take pictures on our phone to make sure we could soak it all in. We rode more than ten miles south through numerous towns and private roads along the nicely paved bike path, and then opted to stop at a local pizza place for a quick bite. To our surprise the garlic chips we ordered as a snack actually came out on a large tray, and it became clear this restaurant had a different name for their cheese bread. Both of us were shocked at first but ultimately happy with our delicious treat, which we devoured in a few minutes. Once we finished our drinks and paid our check, it was time to head back in the same direction we came to finish off our great bike trip. Before we finally pulled back into the lot near our car, we decided to stop for a few minutes on a nearby beach and take in our amazing views of the lake one last time. After numerous pictures and a few final sips from our water bottles we hopped aboard our bikes and rode the final few miles back to where we started. Despite being quite tired from such a long ride that spanned well into the afternoon, we both agreed that this place was an amazing destination that would be worth coming back to. Our decision to rent bikes also proved to be a great idea. We agreed it was the best way to explore such a great area that many people often speed right through with their car. We have already planned a repeat trip back to the lake, and I know both of us will be counting down the days until we can go back.

That is, I had planned and organized a session for the conference.

As a result, he would be unable to attend the session. This left me in a bit of a bind.

This had the effect of masking my lack of preparedness. As such, the discussion went relatively smoothly, even though I had no prior experience doing so in this setting.

So far I have received nothing but commemoration and positive feedback on my work. This is despite that fact that I really don't find it hard and have quite a bit of downtime to relax on my phone and browse the internet. I honestly find most of the work to be easy and it comes naturally to me. I've gotten great feedback from my leadership team as well, so I really think I will be able to excel in this position and get a very high position in the future. I'm very excited about the opportunity and I think I will be able to be a millionaire from working here. My promotion was to a senior level position and I think I can lead a team of analysts in the near future. I also think I can take my skills and abilities from this job to other large companies. At such a young age I am very excited about how my career is progressing. My peers are not progressing as fast as I am and I try to be very humble when talking about the promotion.

A is a retired (got shot in the line of duty) police officer, and so as soon as it happened I thundered down the stairs, rang his doorbell incessantly, over and over, while on the phone with the police. He had been outside smoking and so when he came back in, he said he saw me pacing the stairs like a cornered animal, sobbing uncontrollably. Apparently (I have no memory of this) I just sort of screamed, \"A, he's dead.\" The rest of this is a blur of police officers, the coroner, detectives, lots of flashing lights and crying and phone calls. I don't remember that blur. What I remember is the downstairs neighbors across the hall from A's apartment holding me in their arms and praying over me, their voices a tide of soothing murmurs. I remember A pullling aside an officer - he knew all of them - and telling them that I was family, and they needed to treat me as such. I remember standing beside the investigator's unmarked vehicle as one of the officers pulled me into his embrace and towed that line between business and casual, still \"ma'am\"ing me but being as helpful as he could. I remember the kindness and gentle demeanor everyone treated me with that night. If he knew how many people were upset, if he had ANY idea how many people were so devastated, he'd have never left us. I spent this weekend, four months ago, holding his family close to me, sharing memories and laughter and General Tso's chicken with his father and mother, his grandmother. I see him mirrored in their actions - his father's reflexive \"rubbing the back of his head in times of stress\" motion, his mother's love of animals and her silly, non-PC sense of humor. He has his mother's nose and mouth, his father's kind, loving eyes, and his grandmother's generous heart. I held his grandmother while she cried and asked me if her grandson loved her, because she'd been told he did, but she just wasn't sure. I spent two nights and three days with these people, my future in-laws, and hugged the dog I loved very much goodbye. His father handed me a worn-out leather Bible, told me it had been his first after he'd been saved, and he wanted it to stay in the family. He pressed it into my hands and I rubbed the cover like a talisman as I went back inside the apartment building, too sad to see them leave.", "label": "recalled", "group": "GV821H5V"}

The next morning we hit the road very early. She wanted to spend as much time as possible exploring the home so we didn't waste any daylight. The home was everything we'd imagined and more. It felt like we were transplanted back to the late nineteenth century. There were reenactors dressed up like the Wilder family. They had all the old tools and machinery commonly seen around settler homes back then. They were doing ordinary daily chores like scrubbing clothes. We even got to see a settler churning real butter from cream. Then there were the animals. I think this was my favorite part. Seeing how the cows and other animals were kept and maintained was kind of a thrill to me. By the end of the day we were both exhausted.

She went on ahead to get over and I started walking. If someone else came up from behind, I would have to move really close to the road to give them room to pass. But surely there would be no one else right? I watched my friend go across as I continued to talk. All of a sudden, I heard a biker behind me. I had to move over.

Because I had no idea what else to do, I remained in my college town for another year and a half. This began as a very dark time for me, but I slowly began to move away from depression and engage with life more and more. I started a new relationship during this time, and we decided to move to a new city once she graduated. We picked a place we had no connections to but were interested in exploring, and we began to look for apartments while saving up for a deposit. It was scary but exciting to not know where we would end up or if we would even be able to find a place to live before our lease was up in our college town. In the last week of the lease, we were able to sign on for a new apartment. After an arduous moving process, we stopped to get some groceries for the new place. I started feeling scared then at this new unfamiliarity I had moved into. The things I had been surrounded with for the past 6 years were gone, and I wasn't sure how I would fit into this new life. I had no idea where I would find work or if I would be able to pay rent in the next month. The apartment was several miles outside of the city I wanted to live in, and it was in a pretty rural. It had no windows and felt stuffy and suffocating. It was filled with spiders and other bugs that we were never able to fully get rid of. It was small and cramped but not in the cozy way that some of my previous residences were.

I called my mother so she knew what was going on, and she tried to hide it from my father, but he somehow figured out something was wrong. Meanwhile, in the emergency room across town I was having wires taped to my chest, answering a lot of questions, and having blood drawn. And then I waited. I was there for a long time, just waiting. My brother came by to stay with me for a while, until he had to go pick up my father at the other hospital. It soon became clear, through the monitoring and the blood work, that I had not had a heart attack. I had to do a stress test, which involved walking on a treadmill to get my heart pounding, and then I went back to waiting. I spent at least three hours after the test sitting in my emergency room cubicle, waiting for the results, or some kind of answer. A nurse came in and did a double-take when she saw me\u2013she had no idea I was still in there. Finally, after about 8 hours in the emergency room, hours that combined terror and boredom in a toxic stew of emotion that ended with anger and frustration, and doctor came in and told me I was fine. Maybe it was just stress. I was given a list of reasons for chest pain, and released to go sit in the waiting room (still in my R2-D2 pajamas, which I had been wearing when I called the ambulance) for my sister-in-law to pick me up. It was a weirdly anticlimactic ending to it all, although preferable to actually having a heart attack, but the fear lingers to this day.", "label": "recalled", "group": "6GPJUV1L"}

No-one even noticed until I pointed it out, and by that point I realized how little it mattered in the grand scheme of things.

It was absolutely the most exciting and stressful event of my life. I had spent years preparing for this--building my credit score up, saving money, researching loan types, finding a good mortgage broker, and so on. Once I finally felt ready, the search for the right house took more than a year. The market in my area was very hot, so I lost out on several potential houses because the sellers chose to accept another offer. I did not even make an offer on most of the houses I saw. The hot market had caused a lot of \"flipped\" properties to hit the market as sellers hastened to take advantage of high prices--and many of those had obviously poor quality renovation work, some of which was in violation of local regulations. Some homes had not had any work done at all and were in extremely poor condition for the price, requiring extensive and expensive repairs just to become habitable. It did not help that I was trying to buy a home at a lower price range. Finally, however, I was lucky. The sellers of the house I ended up buying had originally accepted another offer instead of mine. The buyer they chose backed out at the closing table. Another buyer was selected, but they were unable to follow through with their offer due to financing issues. I was the third choice, but my offer was solid and we closed on schedule--April 26th, which happens to be my birthday. At long last, I had finally bought my very first house. I was so proud and excited, but I was also mentally exhausted from the years of preparation and searching. Even more work was yet to come. The house I bought was habitable, but I wanted to do some work on the inside prior to moving in: cleaning, patching, painting. I did most of this work personally, with the help of my partner and father, while also working full-time and attending college part-time. After about a month of work, we finally moved in all of our belongings. I am not sure how I managed to accomplish all of this, but somehow I did. I appreciate the support of my partner and my family. I still think about this event daily, with pride and a lingering touch of disbelief.

We held apartment meetings, created chore lists; they would agree to start picking up after themselves, and to their credit they would.....for a week!

Last month they where both late on rent by a whole 2 weeks, I was able to cover it and told them they had to pay me back by the 14th. Well, the 14th came and I asked again for the rent money, I was told to stop bugging them about it and they'd get it...Apparently John didn't stop off at the bank after work.... Yea? Right!

George has two daughters that are five and eight.  And, I have one daughter that is eight and one son who is four.  My son Ryan is a very active and curious little boy.  We were married in a gazebo at a park.  The park was filled beautiful gardens and a lake with a water feature in the middle.  Our wedding day was on a beautiful summer day.  During the ceremony the local ducks decided to join us.  The ducks made a mess on the floor of the gazebo.  As we were saying our vows, Ryan noticed the ducks and decided to check them out.  He dashed to the area of the gazebo, where the ducks were.  As he ran toward them, he slipped and fell in the duck's poop and tripped over my grandmother's feet, soiling her shoes.  By that time the ducks decided to leave and they waddled towards the lake.  When Ryan got up from tripping over my grandmother's feet, he chased after the ducks.  By this time we saw Ryan chasing the ducks and going towards the lake.  George and I stopped saying our vows to each other and chased after Ryan.  But, it was too late to catch him before he got to the lake.  To our dismay, Ryan fell in the lake.  Thank goodness the water was not deep at the edge and we were able to get to him safely.  After all the drama, we went back to the Gazabo and continued saying our vows.  Our wedding day was a good day overall although, it was not what I expected.", "label": "imagined", "group": "0Y5LK9WP"}

Technically it is not an actual dog park, and all dogs are supposed to be on a leash while there, but in practice nearly everybody lets their dog run free because the park is mostly just one big field lined with trees. There is a baseball diamond at one corner for kids, but that is about it. On this occasion I had my dog on her leash because I could see at the far end of the park that there was a lady walking her dog on a leash as well, and it would be rude to let my dog just run free and approach her. When we got closer to each other, I said hello and the dogs were of course quite happy to meet each other and curious about their respective scents. We talked for a while about breeds and ages and so forth and she told me about her dog's tumor, which was actually visible from his side. He was getting a bit older and it is somewhat common for fatty tumors to form, though they can turn out to be malignant when checked via biopsy by a veterinarian. He was scheduled to be checked soon and I expressed my concern and empathy for her worry, since my previous dog (who died a few years back) also had to have a tumor checked and removed towards the end of her life. It was somewhat reassuring for her to hear that my dog's tumor was not malignant and was simply a fatty tumor which could be removed by surgery. She of course hoped to receive the same diagnosis when going to the vet. We said goodbye after about 5 or 10 minutes of chatting, and the next time I saw her was a month or two later. Her dog had a patch of stubble in the area where the tumor had been removed and thankfully it had not been malignant. I knew that he was an older dog and would probably not be in good health for too much longer, so when I told her about CBD dog treatments it was with not just surgery recovery in mind. That type of treatment can help older dogs with a whole range of issues, and my younger dog even used CBD dog treats for help with her hip issues stemming from an injury. Since I carry a lot of my dog gear in a big plastic bin in the trunk of my vehicle, I went and got out the half-full bag and showed it to her. She was very interested in the positive results I had seen, and I felt so much sympathy for her dog that I spontaneously offered to give her the rest of them since I could just order some more online. The gesture was accepted graciously, and I felt like I did something good to alleviate the feeling of sadness I had for witnessing the suffering of her older dog. I have chatted with her a couple of times since then and it is too painful for me to point out that although her dog is doing good now post-surgery, he likely only has a couple of years left to live in the best-case scenario.", "label": "retold", "group": "VP2PLHHY"}

When I decided to just write and see what came out, it came out disjointed. Nothing really made much sense regardless and it was a flowing sea of words that were choppy like waves. Soon, I realize that maybe I was thinking about this all wrong. I thought how writing like Bukowski is different than writing in the style of him. His style is very unique and I really love how he tells stories. Maybe his style is a little disjointed, much like my writing in the class was becoming. At the end of the class, we all turned into the professor our work. The next day, I was called to the front to read my story and was used as an example of how to write in the style of someone and not copying them. I was flattered that my work was recognized!

She didn't give her due as a doctor. She ignored my pleas that something was wrong and ended up delaying my epidural until I was past the point of receiving it. Then as soon as I delivered my child, I passed out. When I awoke hours later, my husband filled me in. Apparently I began to hemorrhage and lost a lot of blood. He assured me that our newborn daughter was okay. My mother was on her way after hearing about me. I wondered if there was anything the doctor could've done to prevent it.

I had been applying to jobs for many months prior to that moment but nobody wanted to hire me because I was still in school. At the time, I was working part-time as a server at a restaurant. Anyone who has ever been a server knows that it's a stressful job to have because you never know how much money you will make.

Sometimes, I would even be sent home early because it was slow and there were no customers. This doesn't help when you have bills and can barely afford to take care of yourself. I started to become very depressed because my bills were piling up more and more. I only made enough money to buy groceries and get gas. I was unable to pay my bills nor do anything fun.

I experienced an emotional roller-coaster moving swiftly from excitement, nervousness, frustration, delight, and finally into pure unadulterated ecstasy. I even got to meet the band! The guys were amazing, I felt like an old friend visiting them. I really expected the meet and greet to suck, they'd be tired from performing and just want us gone. It wasn't like that at all! For a moment I thought one of them was going to invite me to an after party but when someone yawned the moment was gone. What is really the magic of all of this is that weeks later, I can still feel the traces of how that day made me feel. I can't believe it's been nearly a MONTH since then! I desperately want to go to another show. I've been checking the tour dates just hoping they'll update with one near me soon. So far the closest one is in Cincinnati, probably too far away. I might just look at flights anyway. You never know, right? Oh, who am I kidding? I can't afford even the cheapest flight. Maybe going to another show will feel the same, I doubt it. I mean who else has the kinds of fans and stage presence as Bad Religion? I heard Pink is coming to town, maybe I will look at those ticket prices. I know some of my friends like Pink though, I really want to go alone, like I did before. I know I will see them play again, I just hope I can do it soon!", "label": "imagined", "group": "7CDSCDD3"}

When she arrived, we hugged and she told the story of my birth (like she does every year) and said that I was born so fast that by the time my father got home, the hospital had called to say I'd been delivered. Back in my parents day, many husbands would drop their laboring wives off at the hospital only to return after the baby was born.  But let me get to the point of my story. Growing up, my mother used to tell me stories about how her parents fell in love and got married. It was the 1930's and they were young and poor so my grandmother never had a wedding ring. Later on, after 3 children were born, my grandfather opened a jewelry store in a little town in south Georgia. My grandfather took my grandmother to his store and had her pick out any ring she wanted.  It was a very touching story and I always thought it was so sweet. She picked out a modest diamond ring and a matching diamond fishtail band. She only wore it when she dressed up for some special occasion. My grandparents have been gone for a couple of decades now and my father died a few years ago.  My mother was going through some of my fathers things and went into the safe.  She came across the ring and decided that I should have it.  So I got a birthday card and a little gift that touched me deeply.  I was so surprised that she gave me the rings because I never knew she had them.   I now wear the band as part of my wedding set.  It makes me feel special and like a part of them is still with me.", "label": "recalled", "group": "5QIF0R4K"}

My dad was stationed in Louisiana when he was in the military and while I'd never been there, I was pretty sure there weren't that many cliffs. I finally said, ''Wait a minute, a cliff?' I'd been avoiding even looking at him since he made his 'confession,' but now that I looked over, he was about ready to explode.

On a whim, my girlfriend and I had decided to take a day trip to the beach. We headed out right before sunrise and by 10 o'clock we were pulling into the parking lot at the beach. For as long as I can remember, I've loved the water. I grew up near the ocean and have always loved to surf and body board. My girlfriend, on the other hand, was much more of a sunbathing type, so usually I would be out in the water on my own. On this particular morning, it was early in the season, so the beach was relatively uncrowded. The waves weren't quite big enough to be worth surfing, so I decided that I would just enjoy the water and possibly catch a few waves body surfing. I dived out into the water, ducking under waves, until finally I got past the point where the waves were breaking. I love to swim beyond the waves because it is so peaceful out there. You can watch the waves break on to the shore and the people on the beach, all while relaxing in the water, surrounded by the peaceful ocean. I was floating on my back for awhile, deep in peaceful thought, when all of a sudden a felt something bump against the bottom of my leg. I was immediately startled, but I am very comfortable in the ocean, so I quickly dismissed it as a piece of debris or clump of seaweed and went back to floating on my back. Just as I started to relax again, I saw what appeared to be a fin surface for just a moment about 8 feet to my left. Once again, due to my experience, I tried to be rational and tell myself that it was most likely a dolphin. Still, I was uncomfortable and started to carefully make my way back to shore. Just as a I passed back over the wave line, I saw the fin again, but this time I could also see the outline of a nearly seven foot shark attached to it. I will never forget the feeling of being that close to a predator of that size and power. All of the Shark Week specials in the world combined wouldn't have been able to prepare me for the feeling of sheer helplessness I experienced as I realized that my life was in the hands of the literal dinosaur just a few feet away from me. My mind instantly froze and instincts fought to take over. Every part of my body was telling me to swim away as fast as I could, but I knew that would only make my situation worse. I calmly moved at a slow and steady pace away from the shark and towards the shore. I decided to train my vision on my girlfriend, and told myself I wouldn't look back. After what felt like hours, I finally got back to shore and ran up to our blanket. That was enough ocean for me for one day, and after telling my girlfriend what had happened, we decided we would spend the rest of the day safe on the sand.", "label": "imagined", "group": "CSD17B7R"}

I asked them if they know what their room number was and they said it was 1125. So I had to walk up to the front desk with them to see if they could get a new room key. The clerk typed in their information with the room number. Then to their surprise they could not find them in the system. So, the clerk did a few more things to see what was going on with their room situation. At that time they where getting very nervous and a little upset. This went on for a few more minutes with the clerk asking for help from his supervisor. Finally after the supervisor arrived she started looking some other places he could look up with his clearance. Come to find out that they where at the wrong resort and was staying at the resort next to the Art of Animation. Which was the Pop Century resort area. So, we got a golf cart to take them over to their resort area and was able to get in their room finally after about two hours of searching. They had not paid close attention to the surroundings when they arrived last night when they got to the resort. In the end it was a happy ending after all.", "label": "recalled", "group": "LLPA47YK"}

It was my sister, her boyfriend, and myself getting ready to enjoy a very American vacation. The next day was the 4th of July fireworks on the lake. The town had a special event every year where people would take their families out on the boats and huddle up in a cove near the town fairgrounds. From the fairgrounds they would launch off tons and tons of fireworks. All in perfect view for the huddled up boats. It was incredible to watch and such a unique experience. There were more boats than I ever remembered there being in the past. Boats blast off their own choice of song as the nearly 45 minute show continued, much to the enjoyment of everyone after a 10 minute disappointing show the previous year. Many people would bring foods to snack on and some would even have grills aboard their boats. It was such an American smell. The smell of fireworks, delicious food and a summer breeze. Seeing the fireworks reflect off the water is truly something else. You could also relax in the water on a raft during the show with the pitch black water below. It's truly a one of a kind experience unique to the area and something I'd gladly do again next year. We spent the rest of the time at the lake enjoying warm weather and family time as well as travelling in town for some antique stores.", "label": "retold", "group": "G1YDI73V"}

I harnessed up 11 out of the 12 dogs i had to the sled and hit the trail.  The trail was extremely fast considering the sun was melting the hard packed snow and freezing it over night.  We took off on our normal training run and the dogs were extremely focused.  I had my go-pro rolling since the day was so beautiful and i wanted to capture the openness of crossing the river on such a bright day.  We ran without a break until we got to the river and i could tell the dogs were getting tired.  We took a break right before the downhill to cross the river and when i looked up i noticed a moose just across the bank.  The dogs were so tired they didn't even notice, the more i watched this big cow moose eat off the trees i noticed a calf emerge from the woods behind her.  I watched in amazement as i always did when i saw moose, now was my chance to be quiet and watch because they hadn't seen me yet.  While i was watching the moose i heard a scream not too far off which sounded like a cat, and indeed it was.  Only 45-50 yards away from the moose was a full grown lynx walking the bank of the river.  Lynx are extremely rare to see in the wild and i was excited.  I couldn't believe that the dogs had not made a sound at this point, but they typically didn't during a needed rest.  Just when i thought this free nature show couldn't get any better a second lynx walked out from the woods and began a mating call with the first lynx.  I listened to them and watched them walk the bank for what seemed like and hour.  I have never seen anything so great and beautiful from nature and probably never will.  Soon as the lynx and moose were out of my site i commanded the dogs to hit the trail and continue the run.

If you like off the beaten path, in this order from my experience, Bato rice terraces, then legaspi, then Coron. Bato because it is so unique and out of the way (overnight is trip away), and you can do day and camping hikes. Legaspi because it is also not on the typical tourist agenda, but still really cool sights to see. Also great spicy foods. Coron is a small island, so technically off the beaten path, but is surrounded by ww2 Japanese ship wrecks that divers love to frequent. I spent a month there with a Filipino friend and we had a freakin blast. Also got to meet all of his family in his relatively small village, and do local things.

We decided to go to a local beach one day since it was the summer to swim in the water and sunbathe. We also found a couple free parks to hike where we saw some beautiful scenery and animals. The most important thing for me was tasting the local cuisine, so we ate out almost every meal. We found the best rated restaurants and eateries within our budget and went to a different place each time. We even spent a couple nights camping in the wilderness to save even more money during our trip. One of the last things we did was went to local shops to find local souvenirs to purchase. We didn't want to risk losing them throughout our travels or have it stolen, so we waited until the evening before we left. I bought a couple shirts, jewelry, and a keychain.

It was a long awaited trip and a lot of planning had gone into it because of the international travel involved. There was much excitement at the prospect of being exposed to a new culture, meeting new people and of course, the exotic destination. I had always been fascinated by Jamaican music and food but there\u2019s something surreally authentic about experiencing these aspects directly in the native country and I just couldn\u2019t wait for the plane to land in Montego Bay... woo hoo! As we checked into the hotel set in the midst of Palm trees and shimmering water, Dad winked at my brother and me, and told us to meet him and mom at the pool. My brother and I exchanged a knowing glance- it was a family tradition. Every year we voted on our vacation destination and upon getting there we planned our activities for the stay. Our folks encouraged us to steer clear of the usual touristy stuff and come up with novel ways to interact with the locals..... andddd this time I already knew what I wanted to do. Last year, after the trip was finalized, as part of a school project we were asked to make a pen pal from across the globe, and no prizes for guessing, I chose Jamaica, and hard as it is to fathom, Aiesha has become my best friend. The bond that forged between us through the exchange of snail mail and this trip planned to her hometown seemed like the most wonderful of synchronicity! Everyone except for my brother was excited when I suggested we visit Aiesha at her school but it was my mom\u2019s idea to bring supplies to the local school which in retrospect turned out to be a lesson I will never forget. After the initial yawn-yawn, my brother got into it and we really enjoyed shopping for the school supplies. The visit to the local school, meeting Aiesha in person, distribution of the supplies directly to the students and their euphoria at receiving gifts from friends from another country is etched in my mind forever. Words truly cannot capture how happy I was, but it truly was an unforgettable trip!!! Aiesha and my friendship continues to deepen.

All traffic stopped and I was front row. I got out and ran up to the vehicle just in front of me to check on its passengers. The person in this car was a little bloody from hitting their head on the steering wheel, and they were a little shocked, but they were in overall good shape. Two of the other cars, I think 5 or 6 in total, had serious damages and injuries. We had to pull two people out and get them laid on the ground as their car was on fire. It didn't end up exploding but you never know. Anyway, paramedics came and took all the injured away. Bad there were horrible injuries but good there were no deaths. The police came as well.

We took the trip with very little planning, and just kind of decided where to go as we went along.  We visited many small towns and it was very beautiful.  At one point, we saw a mountain with a waterfall, and decided to go climb it.  It was really amazing.  We even found a place near the top where the water cascaded into a pool, and then out the other side of the pool to continue down the mountainside.  We took a dip in the water, which was ice cold.  As we drove along the coast we stopped in many little towns, and browsed around in some really cool antique shops.  We also visited a place in Canada with a giant lobster statue, because the place was considered the lobster capital of Canada, and of course, we stopped to have a seafood lunch with a lobster bisque soup that was out of this world good.  As we went up the coast and into Canada, even though it was already spring, some places were still snow covered and quite cold.  We even got stuck in a snowdrift on a remote highway, and had to wait hours until we got lucky, and passing by snowplow pulled us free of the snowbank with a heavy chain.  We ate poutine in a small french Canadian town in Quebec, and it was delicious.  I had never eaten cheese curds before, and they were really chewy and tasty!  My favorite part was all the little towns in New England.  They were so quaint and pretty, and in every one, there were these amazing antique shops full of odds and ends that really told stories of the history of the place.

My professors were from many different cultures and I had many of them who wouldn't mind sharing their stories with the class.  Not only that, but people from different backgrounds as well, such as poor, middle class, and rich. I really do miss many of my colleagues, who really were different from me in terms of backgrounds, race, some even from different countries. One thing I really liked about them was that If you ever had a question to ask about their culture, they wouldn't mind sharing , as long as you were respectful about it. My best friend in University was Asian and he's told me many stories about where he was from, and the thing's he used to do while there.  I would also share the same about where I'm from and my experiences from living in America.  We were truly like-minded in that way. I think these experiences will stick with me forever, as it isn't often that you get a chance to get out of your comfort zone the way University provides.

It\u2019s often difficult, and sometimes it can even seem impossible, but in the long run, it\u2019s more than worth it. When you need a favor, a landlord who likes you (like a trusted family member) can be a real lifesaver. Of course, that doesn\u2019t mean you have to bake them cookies or mow their lawn. Just pay your rent on time, let them know immediately if you ever need a little more time to gather the money, and don\u2019t make a habit of paying late. Beyond that, just make sure you know your landlord-tenant rights both locally and nationally, and your relationship should be easy-going and mutually beneficial. No matter where you live, specific rights apply to all tenant-landlord relationships, regardless of whether they\u2019re spelled out in or omitted from your particular lease agreement. These include but are not limited to the right to receive police assistance in emergency situations free of charge, the right not to cover a landlord\u2019s legal fees in the event of a dispute that ends up in court, and the prohibition of landlords from discriminating against prospective tenants on the grounds that they have children. Similarly, the law dictates that all tenants have a certain set of responsibilities inherent to their rental agreements. For instance, tenants are required to pay their rent in full on the day outlined in their lease. Tenants must use amenities like parking .lots and laundry rooms responsibly and without causing harm or destruction to them. Tenants are obligated to dispose of all waste materials such as car batteries, motor oil, and electronics in a safe and proper manner. It was a surprise encounter at just the right moment. It was good timing since I hadn't talked to my neighbor in a while before this. In addition, some states, counties, cities, and municipalities have laws and statutes in place that expressly prohibit tenants from participating in gang activity, physical assault, or the sale/purchase of illegal substances. Unlawfully using a firearm on the premises is another hard no. you feel like your rights have been violated, contact your local tenants\u2019 rights organization for assistance. In the event that they agree that your rights may have been violated or that the landlord\u2019s demands are illegal, seek legal assistance to determine your options. Ignoring disputes usually only escalates the problem and creates bad blood between you and your landlord .a situation that can seriously tarnish your peaceful home life. I have been in My apt I month and I have no hot water for three weeks what do I need to do. And everyday I call they tell me it will be on today.

I had been a nurse for thirteen years and I didn't sign up for this shit. I was used to caring for younger, healthier patients that could perform basic tasks like wiping their own ass and bathing.  Even the cripple down the hall in a wheelchair is easier to take care of than this useless old bag as even he could wipe his own ass.  But nevertheless as I was getting ready to administer drugs to a patient in psych I was called to the emergency room because an old bag had a seizure and was now flopping around like a fish on her gurney that the EMT'S had strapped her onto.  They asked me to give her CPR and I asked if there wasn't anyone else around?  They said no all the nurses were busy in psych so for the first time ever I had to give an elderly woman mouth to mouth. I took a big gulp and took a long sip of water.  I wasn't mentally prepared for what I was about to do.  I closed my eyes and tried to picture the elderly woman was a more attractive younger, man.  My lips met hers and I nearly gagged as I was literally giving her mouth to mouth. I kept blowing into her mouth until finally she started coughing into my mouth and I jolted back in disgust.  The old bag had woken up and stopped shaking all over the place. Completely disgusted with what I had just done I immediately lifted her up and put her on a different gurney and was on my way to the elevator to bring her to psych when the EMT asked why I was going to bring her to the psych ward and not general care.  I lied and said we had no beds left and I really wanted to dump her off onto someone else and make her someone else's problem.  So I brought her up to psych and sedated her as she started talking non stop about her son and how he never calls her anymore.  I injected her with a large dose of oxycontin and she was out like a light.  I came back later to check on her and she wouldn't wake up.  I checked for a pulse and nothing.

It is difficult to even come up with a single favorite book but I did in this case. I liked it so much , maybe because at 59, I am aging and related well to the characters.  I am also a Texan.  Lonesome Dove is about two aging ex-Texas Rangers that feel the need to have one last great adventure.  This last adventure takes the form of a cattle drive from south Texas north to Montana (if memory serves me well).  There are many other characters involved with different backgrounds that could very well have books of their own.  The adventures abound and there really isn't a dull moment in the entire book.  Larry McMurtry excels at character development to the point that I felt as though I knew them.  He also excels at plots and sub-plots that are very compelling. While it isn't \"War and Peace\" long, it is a rather long book but I wished it was longer when I finished it.  I was very sad when I finished reading Lonesome Dove.  It was like losing a playmate, maybe even a friend.  I wondered what I was going to do for reading next.  I ended up researching similar books written by Larry McMurtry.  I did find other similar books that were written about the western United State at around the same time period but it just didn't match the colorful characters in Lonesome Dove.

They weren't allowing the newer people to the construction site until they all took tests and safety courses. Alex had done these before with the company and instead of giving the refresher, they went ahead and let him do the jobs. Well, he had forgotten about a helmet and went he bent down to pick up a tool, he got smashed in the front of his face with a steel beam. The beam was being rose from the ground to the next floor and someone had given the \"all clear\" despite Alex being there. The beam smashed him in the chin and jaw and did some damage. It was minor compared to what it could have been! I was so surprised to hear about this! I asked if they needed anything and she said they were doing well.", "label": "imagined", "group": "ICDWSD3T"}

Our conversations were usually tense and extremely upsetting so I had slowly gotten used to the loneliness of not hearing from them. Anyway, it seems they were breaking up with their current romantic partner and they were very devastated. They told me that they had no friends and I was the only person that they could call. My heart ached for them but there was virtually nothing that I could do for them except listen. Eventually things got ironed out a little and it seemed like they were on a good path. We talked several times a week. Then the phone calls stopped again and I started to fear that they had gone back to their ex. I had found out that the ex supposedly hated me and did not allow my child to call me or answer the phone if I called them. After about ten days I did get in touch with them and yes they had gone to see their ex. Then they told me they were quitting their job and moving across the country to live with their ex and the ex's parents until they could find work. The last time I spoke to them was about three weeks ago when they were packing. Again, we had a very tense short conversation and then that was it. So, I googled what was going on between us and I found this thing called 'parent abandonment'. Just reading the words was like a punch in the gut. How could this be happening? Apparently it's something of a trend with the younger crowd. I read a few articles about it and then I decided I knew all I ever wanted to know about this. The best advice was from a women who had four children walk away from her at different points in their lives. And this brave soul said, \"Go out and live a full life because you did not abandon your children.\" I'm working on that part now and I might even move.", "label": "recalled", "group": "WXFZYE0V"}

One thing I really admired about Andrew Yang was his concern for my local county and the people that reside within it. He has made every effort to address poverty across county lines and speak to us about the rising opiod epidemic that's sweeping our nation. Not only that, he found ample time to speak about the dangers of climate change that we are currently experiencing today. He began with a very inspiring speech about how it was time to change our country and led us into a discussion about poverty within our city. He spoke about how it was unfair that so many sat within the streets, hungry and poor, while other's indulge on their riches and how that needed to change. He then went on to speak about climate change and how we needed to act today to ensure that our children won't have to deal with a failing planet when it's their turn to lead the world. Rising temperatures have been adding to our sea level which, within the next 50 years, will affect our children and our children's children, which is why we need to work to reduce emissions to have a clean Earth for them in the future. Lastly, he began to speak about how the opiod crisis is even affecting our county and the evidence is mounting that these people need mental treatment instead of constant arrests. They need to be cared for instead of shunned and we need to put ourselves in there places if we are to see exactly what they are going through. He also spoke about the actions of Washington and spoke about how it was important for us to not fall into that trap of hate and bigotry and instead lighten the world with our actions. How instead of shipping Mexican's back to there home country, that we will instead create a pathway to citizenship for these individuals so there kids aren't trapped in the very situation that they were running away from. He also spoke of the importance of culture within America and how that would be going against everything that we stand against.

This was the house I grew up in, and the house my children will spend most of their growing years in. My husband and I were having financial troubles and we knew something had to change soon. My dad graciously agreed to let us move in and make any changes we saw fit. Our current plan is for my husband to look for a new job, one that pays him more than his current job, and save enough money to move out into his own apartment. As you can imagine, this can make for a stressful experience for a few reasons. One, we are divorcing, so we do not always see to eye and seeing each other constantly does not help our situation. Two, in the beginning it was quite rough moving back home to the house I grew up in. I felt like I had failed. Watching all my peers on social media get engaged, get married, buy a house, only added to that feeling. This feeling thankfully, did not last long. I now feel like this is my house, and I am happy to give my kids some stability, rather than moving apartments every few years. I did not realize how much of an effect moving had on me or my older son until one day shortly after we moved he made me promise that we wouldn't move again. Now more than ever, stability is important to me. That was probably one of the most surprising parts of the move, how it affected him, and how for the first time I felt like I had truly failed on my end as a parent to provide him with a stable home. The second part was feeling how I had failed as an adult by not being able to live on my own like I \"should\". Living with my dad again has some perks, like he is always around to babysit, and there are drawbacks as well. He is not the cleanest person and so that is frustrating.

My youngest, even though he has been at home with me for his whole life, was not at all afraid of bring at school without me which made me proud that he has the self confidence to know that he can do it alone.  We walked together to his classroom and he gave the teacher a big hug when we got there. I helped him find his seat and put his supplies up. He wanted to do most of it on his own to prove to me he was \"big kid.\" I was hesitant to leave him but he told me he was fine and I could go.

I was excited and determined and counted down the days until it's release. I even told my mom about the plans to go and get it. Once released, I made sure to get up and get it the day of release since only a limited amount would be in each Target. I stopped at a couple of other stores in the mall area to run errands with my mom but as soon as we were done with that, I rushed to Target happily. As soon as I saw the Bulbasaur Funko, my face lit up I was so happy.

I had to stay at the hospital in his room if I wanted to be able to hold him at his \"touch times\" so I was getting, at most, 1.5 hours of sleep at a time, for nearly 3 weeks. The level of sleep deprivation a human body can handle is truly insane. I met some amazing people that also had babies in the NICU. It's really cool to see all the different family dynamics.

Jake had seemed kind of fishy, smiling a lot during the previous two weeks.

Considering he typically doesn't even stay the night, this made me very nervous!  He refused to tell me where we were going, but told me I needed jeans and shoes for walking outside. So I nervously packed up and we got into his car.  He wanted to put a blindfold on me, but I refused, because it would make me car sick. I agreed not to pay attention to where we were going.   Turns out, he had rented us a cabin right on the lake, about 90 minutes out of town.  It was so beautiful!  It was quiet and peaceful.  The first thing he wanted to do was go swimming in the lake.  I didn't bring a swimsuit!  Well, he didn't either, and turns out he had wanted us to go skinny dipping.  It was awesome, but I was so embarrassed because I had never let Jake see me naked in full daylight where he could see all of me.

They may not have expected to leave or give so many things but I think that they had so many property transactions going on and so much of their own moving stress that they just had to do whatever to be done with it all and move with kids and dogs and all the things that must have made their own move very difficult. I think they were actually a week or two between closings as well the way that their timing worked out and they had to store everything and just live in a hotel for awhile. It's much easier to go from renting to buying a house then to go from one property that you own to another I think. I'm glad things worked out the way they did for us and I think everything worked out for the sellers as well. They were definitely a blessing to us.", "label": "recalled", "group": "HCUBZWQO"}

She sent me a picture of the dog. He was very thin and looked very sad. We both felt very sorry for the dog. My wife saw the dog a week after we had moved into a new house. We had talked about getting another dog after we moved but ultimately decided against it. Our older dog is jealous of attention given to other dogs. We thought that he would be happier as an only dog. So when we first saw the dog at the shelter we talked about donating money to his care if he was picked up by a rescue group. However a few hours later neither of us could stop thinking about him. We called the shelter and were told that the dog needed more care than they could provide and that he wouldn't be kept there any longer. We decided that we had to go pick him up. We took the dog to a vet. They determined that he would need a blood transfusion but that it should wait until the following morning as the vet wasn't sure if he would survive the night. The next day the dog was given a blood transfusion. We were then able to take him home a few days later. We named him Pablo. Several months later he has gained weight and is more than twice the weight he was when we got him. He rather quickly adjusted to living with humans and has learned to use the bathroom outside. He is friendly and loving. Though he does still bite occasionally and is scared of strangers.", "label": "recalled", "group": "HEC2JI4Q"}

I waited until the next morning when he left for work. I took the test and 2 minutes later, I saw it. There was 2 lines. It was positive! I couldn't believe it. I still don't believe it.

I ended up falling out of my bed and I don't even think I was conscious at this point. I fell right onto my arm and sustained a painful hematoma. My roommate came running in and couldn't believe what she saw. She urged me to go to the hospital. I tried to brush it off and go back to sleep but the pain was too much so I agreed to go to the hospital. I sat in the emergency room for 90 minutes before being seen by a doctor and they admitted me to the hospital right away. Apparently the injury wasn't urgent enough to get to me right away but was severe enough to admit me to the hospital. I saw many doctors and even a specialist. They preformed a multitude of tests from X-rays, blood work, and a CAT scan to make sure I didn't have any other injuries. The doctors told me that I would need surgery and I was devasted. Not only did I not want to undergo surgery, what about my exams? The pain and stress were so much to handle and I burst into tears. After discussing surgery and options with a few doctors, the attending physician decided it wasn't necessary and he could treat the injury without surgery.  I was relieved and was released from the hospital the next day, just in time to take my exams.

You know, that moment that you'll be able to look back on and still remember ever little detail, because it just means that much to you? I was lucky enough to be able to experience that with Cash a few months ago. A few girlfriends and I had planned a last minute trip to Clearwater for a girls weekend. Somehow both Lydia's kids and Stacey's kids came down with this god awful stomach bug, so I asked Cash if he wanted to go instead. Spa days aren't exactly a five year old's idea of a grand time, so I knew I had to come up with something that both Cash and I would enjoy. On the flight to Clearwater, we discussed what we wanted to do and decided that fishing would be such an awesome experience for both of us. I grew up fishing, but Cash hadn't gone yet, since his dad wasn't exactly the outdoorsy type.  After a quick Google search and car rental, we were off to the pier to get our fishing permits and gear. When we got to the marina, I paid for the permits and sent Cash to the coolers to look at the bait. I just knew that the live worms and other bait were going to give him quite the shock. The little squeal he let out when he realized the bait was alive gave me a good laugh. After I paid the cashier, I collected our fishing rods and grabbed Cash's hand. It was time to show Cash the joys of fishing. We sat our stuff on the bench near the edge of the dock and I showed him how to bait his hook, and then we did some practice casts. After we both felt confident that he had grasped the concept, I told him to cast off the pier and get ready to do a lot of waiting. I swear, no sooner than his lure hit the water, he had a bite. He squealed with joy as he started reeling in his line. When he finally got the fish on the dock, I helped him remove the hook and toss the fish in the bucket, and repeated the process again. Cash caught a total of twelve fish in the three hours we were there, meanwhile I only caught a measly two. My pride was a little hurt that my five year old just showed me up at fishing, something that I grew up doing, but I could not have been more proud.

His girlfriend was waiting at my place, and they started arguing again. At this point, I started to feel a little guilty for directly influencing the actions that led to their bickering, but at the same time I felt she was being a little dramatic because it wasn't that big of a deal to go out, have a couple of drinks and come back. Then me and my friend decided to hang out longer, and we drove over to his place. We got bored and went out to the bar again, and by the end of the night we were really wasted. On our way back we were being loud and belligerent, urinating all over the street and shouting out statements of ignorance for the world to hear. By the time we got back, his girlfriend calmed down and was in a more cheerful mood... but that didn't last long. Over the course of this drunken adventure, a catchphrase was born: \"OoOoO oOoOo!\" It is a loud expression of joy and excitement, and sounds identical to Joe Rogan's joke involving Ludacris. Well, it didn't take long for \"OoOoO oOoOo!\" to get on his girlfriend's nerves - and after repeatedly telling him to \"shut the f*** up\", she got frustrated and clocked him in the jaw. Suddenly, the mood in the room started to become tense - and of course, my friend and I, being the people that we are, tried to deescalate the tension by shouting \"OoOoO oOoOo!\", but his girlfriend was not having any of it. She proceeded to punch him again. I knew it wasn't going to end well, because my friend is not the type of person to let something like that slide once, let alone twice. She got clocked back this time, got really mad and tried to fight him. Obviously there is a huge size and strength disadvantage for her, so I intervened and broke it up - almost becoming the target of my friend's fury in the process because instead of leaving she tried to use the fact I was restraining him to her advantage. Eventually she left, we went back to having a good time, but then later she decided to come back, being the sophisticated, intelligent university graduate that she is. She ruined our good time again, and my friend tried to peel off in her car.

Drunk me also reasoned that if I kept drinking the way I was, I would either take my own life or die from organ failure. I went up to the reception area and informed the receptionist I needed to be admitted for intoxication, alcohol addiction and suicidal ideation. I gave her my insurance information, filled out the paperwork, and sat in the lobby. I had stopped before getting to the facility and bought and drank two small wine bottles. I could feel them kicking in and with the alcohol running through my body I sat and waited, convinced this was my only option; the only way I would stay alive. I was called back by a paramedic who took my vitals and had me take a breathalyzer. I was 2 times the legal limit; he said if I drove away before sobering up the cops would be called. Back in the lobby, as the wine started to wear off I felt panic. No longer sure if this was the right move, I wondered if walking home was an option. In front of me a door opened and a bald man called me into his office. The substance abuse counselor asked me some generic questions about my addiction, and informed me I would have to stay for 24 hours.

We ate and drank and had a really good time. The next morning I woke up feeling a little weird, not exactly sick, but not myself either. I decided to skip breakfast that morning before heading off to work because of the way I was feeling, and because I'm not a big breakfast eater anyway. Things went downhill from there. I had no appetite that day, but decided not to force myself to eat, thinking that my appetite has to come back eventually. I was wrong. The day after that I felt worse, and again didn't eat. After the third day with no appetite, I decided to make an appointment with my doctor. She ran some tests and asked me what medications I was taking. To my surprise, she told me that not having any appetite for a few days is not all that unusual. She did list some pretty scary things that could be causing my lack of appetite, but said she didn't think it was anything serious. She told me to try to force myself to eat, and to come back in a couple of days if there was no improvement. Well, I tried to do what she said, but I just couldn't make myself eat, because I couldn't even stand the sight of food at that point, and  I missed my appointment with her two days later because I just didn't feel like leaving the house. The next day I began to feel faint. My sister-in-law was with me because she had heard I wasn't feeling well and had come by to check on me. She immediately suggested we go to the emergency room. After seeing how pale and weak I was, they decided to admit me right away. After being admitted, I spent three days in the hospital and they ran more tests, but still couldn't determine the reason for my lack of appetite. In the hospital, they had me on an intravenous drip, and were somewhat successful in getting me to eat a little. Also, while in the hospital they put me on medication to increase my appetite. After the three days I was well enough to go home, I am still on the medication, and my appetite is back to normal.", "label": "imagined", "group": "MWDTHF58"}

A person's career determines their lifestyle both in terms of time and resources available for leisure. Many people also derive a lot of their identity from what they do for work or a career. There are also many industries where a lifestyle may be tied up in a career. For instance, folks that work in the alcohol industry have a pretty specific lifestyle that tends to correspond to their choice of career. Ideally people would be made up of more than just the careers they've chosen but all too often you find folks that seem to have cobbled together an identity based on what they expect people expect of them. In my mind, the most interesting people are folks that have very different careers and lifestyles that sometimes combine in surprising ways. As much as I kind of detest Elizabeth Gilbert, I listened to a talk that she gave about people with different styles of going through life. Some who are incredibly driven and work towards a singular goal but are frankly rather boring. And then there are those that flit from thing to thing and develop a diverse skill set and may not have a huge singular accomplishment but are likely super interesting. There is also a lot to be said for getting out of one's comfort zone. If we only interact with people in a similar career to ourselves, we risk missing out on the upsides of diversity. The same can be said for lifestyle.  If you only hang out with people that have a similar lifestyle, you won't learn much or experience many new things. Especially in cases where a lifestyle is harmful it can be really good to experience folks living in a different way.", "label": "imagined", "group": "Z288P9FV"}

After setting up my tent and then making small talk with numerous groups of relatives that I had not seen in a while, I walked over to the food tables and grabbed myself something to eat. Before I could even grab the bun for my burger, my closest cousin tapped me on the shoulder and handed me an ice cold beer.

After quickly scarfing down the burger and talking with my cousin for a few minutes, we both walked over the to massive bonfire on the front lawn. There must have been 20 relatives already sitting around it, with maybe six or seven different conversations all flowing simultaneously. In many ways it was nostalgic, and I instantly felt at ease around so many of my family and friends. Throughout the night I made a handful more trips to the food table for random snacks and probably more than a handful of trips to the beer coolers. Eventually some of the chairs that housed relatives became empty as we sat by the fire telling stories and remembering great times from the past, and before I knew it I was one of just four cousins left awake when the fire started to finally die out. We knew that our grandma's homemade donuts would be ready for us bright and early in the morning, so we agreed to call it a night and retreat to our tents. The next morning, as expected, we were treated to a glorious spread of fresh donuts decorated in just about every variety possible.

In the middle of those, I have an 18 year old daughter.  She has always been fairly quiet and somewhat reserved, but has been a good kid and we rarely have had to worry about her.  She decided several years ago that she wanted to graduate from high school with an associates degree.  My wife and I both thought this was a great idea and we fully supported her in doing this, but we also advised here that it would be a lot of work. When she got to high school, she got right into it.  Initially, at least, she needed some help figuring out how to go about knowing what classes to take, etc.  She also couldn't start the \"early college\" program until she was a junior (11th grade).  She worked hard and put in a lot of effort between her 11th and 12th grade years.  We were very pleased to see what she was doing. This past April, she graduated with her associates degree in general studies (with honors) a month ahead of her high school graduation.  The following month, she graduated from high school with honors.   I was very proud of her and thought she had done an outstanding job.  We thought the future for her looked bright. A few weeks after her high school graduation, I discovered a number of messages on her instragram account, which were on a shared cell phone we use as the \"home\" phone.

My head hurt more than it ever had after reading these messages because my view of my daughter had changed and not for the better.  I was disappointed and distressed to have this happen.

Once I had a solid idea of how I wanted to pull it off, I went to work researching projectors to find the best bang for my buck.

It was able to be hooked up to a DVD player or a phone/tablet, which was perfect for us. I then waited until the night that I wanted to set things up. That day, she was out playing with friends and I was in the backyard secretly setting things up. I moved deck furniture and put a big blanket on the lawn. By the time i was done, it looked like a miniature living room. We then prepared snacks and broke the news to my daughter.

I toppled some of the leaves from this particular area and saw a little mouse! I got scared, to be honest. Immediately, I threw the stick at it but it just ran away.

I don't think you are getting more value for the price and its slightly outrageous how much just community college costs. I can't imagine what it would be like to go to a four year college. I don't know how some parents are able to afford it. With his talent and ability its worth it and all I can say is how proud of him I am.

I know I went away from the previous time feeling okay about it all, relief, I guess, but as it gets closer to this next round, I'm getting nervous again. I guess I just wish it would end. I wish he would do what he's supposed to do and stop trying so hard to bankrupt me. He wants to see our children in a setting that won't require supervision, but he abandoned them almost two years ago, which is why the order was set in place. We were both interviewed by a social worker, and she told me in no uncertain terms that she would fall on the floor dead if he was given unrestricted visits to our children. This does set my mind at ease, but having to re-live everything I've gone through with him was probably even more difficult than seeing him for the first time in a year and a half. I guess this isn't really re-telling the first experience, so much as re-reflecting on it leading up to the new situation concerning it, but I am still a little nervous. I think the relief comes from knowing he can't personally hurt me anymore, but he does have the potential to hurt my children. Initially, seeing him for the first time was certainly going to bring about nervous feelings, but as time goes by and I realize it's not done, the anger and nervousness that had subsided is turning quickly back to square one. Knowing that our children fear him and don't want to see him makes me worry about the effect this is going to have on them. They're in therapy, but how will it help them once they inevitably have to spend time with him? Will he ultimately disown them if the magistrate decides to hold the original order?

Kubrick died in 1999 and I was too young to have seen Eyes Wide Shut in theater. Now finally I had a chance to see The Shining in person. So I finally got to see it. It was a bundled promotion as there is a new movie coming out called Dr Sleep that is a sequel to The Shining. Couldn't care less, just happy to see the real deal. It was magnificent. It had been newly remastered in 4k and it was simply awesome.  The picture quality was so bright and sharp while maintaining the wonderful film grain. Most surprising was how damn loud it was.

One of them suggested we go to Universal Studios. This was definitely more than I was thinking of. I was hoping we'd just do something close to home, just not at a family members's house. I had never even been out of the state since I was a kid, so this was going to be a big occasion. We booked out flights and went about a week later. I hated the plane ride, but the fun time we had there made up for it. We ate so much overpriced food, went on rides, went sight seeing at areas around the place, and just had a blast. I'm not a fan of Harry Potter, but my friends are, so they suggested we go to the Harry Potter restaurant. Since food was involved, I was down for it. It wasn't great, but I did recognize some of what I saw there, which made it somewhat better. It would have been cooler had I actually been a fan. After a few days there, we all went back home and went on with our lives. I had such a good time.", "label": "imagined", "group": "V1HDB8UW"}

I took my girlfriend along with me, it was her first trip to my home town ever.  The trip started out great, we picked up our rental car and went to grab a pizza. The following day was my brother's wedding ceremony. We thought it had all been planned out thoroughly, but it turns out that nobody had checked the weather report. The day of the wedding came, it started out sunny, a hot day in late July. Clear blue skies and not a cloud to be seen. We were all so optimistic about the big day. The ceremony was scheduled for 6 PM at sunset, so it would start to cool down and allow for some reprieve from the heat of the day. In theory, that was a great idea. However, when my girlfriend and I pulled out of the driveway we noticed something new that we hadn't seen yet on the trip. Storm clouds moving in fast, and lots of them. Dark gray giants rose onto the horizon at a frightening pace. Lighting was visible in the distance as we began our drive to the wedding venue. We hoped and prayed that the storm would blow the other way, an that the outdoor wedding venue would be spared from this particular storm. Would we be able to get away with having the ceremony in decent weather? It became a race with time. As we drove to the wedding ceremony, it felt as though the clouds were following us and growing larger. As we arrived, I greeted my brother in the parking lot and asked if he though it would rain. He said maybe, it depends how fast we can get this done. Everyone was present except for the minister, one of the few people who was completely essential to the process.  As the minister arrived, it finally began to rain. It was raining on my brother's wedding day, I couldn't believe it, but luckily the ceremony was completed and we had a wonderful sunny reception the next day.", "label": "recalled", "group": "TL2VS3OL"}

Some of the group was nervous that they would visit during the night.  I was more concerned with the black bear and most especially the grizzlies.  Both are notorious for letting their noses get them in trouble.  They can smell the food and stick their heads right into tents!  We were sure to put our food in the bear-proof containers provided at the campsite.  But we actually saw some grizzlies visiting the stream when we were fishing.  The salmon were running and the grizzlies rely on these fish to fatten up in order to survive the on-coming winter.  There were several females with cubs who were stationed along the waterfall, catching the salmon that were jumping.  They would pull off some of the skin and nudge it towards the cubs.  They seemed to waste a lot of the fish as they were eating the eggs, the skin and the heads.  I guess they were more interested in the high-calorie parts, which makes sense, considering that they are trying to fatten up.  One bear got too close as one of us was reeling in a fish and the bear decided it was her's.  But the biggest thrill/scare came when a male arrived on the scene.  He seemed to be twice the size of the rest and was a bit of a bully.  But if he got too close to any of the cubs, the brave mom's would confront the massive bear.

I was nearing the exit for my home when I was merging into traffic and felt a bump on the rear of my car as I collided with another car. It was barely a tap on my vehicle but I pulled over with the other vehicle to assess the situation. I recall the passenger and the driver both being loud and irate but the driver was a little more calm. I checked out my car and didn't have any damage at all but the front of the other car had some scrapes and damage. They called the cops and ultimately I was cited because I was the vehicle merging into traffic although they technically hit me from the rear.

I feel I had plenty of space to merge, but the other car increased speed and hit me. I think they knew that I would be at fault because I was merging even if it was them that hit me. My other suspicion is that they work for a car body and paint shop and could easily fix their car but put a higher cost on when reporting it to the insurance company. Lastly, everything was fine that day but later I found out that the both the passenger and driver are claiming an injury to further increase their insurance claim.

The thunderstorm moved fast from the north and hit our area, and the city at large, with powerful winds, rain, and thunder. We live in an area of town with lots of trees, many of which were knocked down in the powerful winds and rain. It ended up knocking out the power, as well as blowing down some large branches in our front yard and a large planter stand in the back porch, ruining our potted herb garden. We didn't want to be late for the dinner, so after the storm passed we carefully started to make our way to the restaurant. Trees were down on many of the streets, and power was out throughout the city, which meant street lights were off or blinking. It was a harrowing journey to get to the restaurant, even though it was only 4 miles away, because of all the careful driving and maneuvering I had to do to avoid downed power lines, trees, flooded streets, and other cars. When we got to the restaurant we found they, too, were without power and probably wouldn't be open at all that evening.  After talking with the rest of the family, what we ended up doing was I ordered pizza from a nearby place that did have power and was open, and driving up with the food to my brothers place north of the city that still had power. Everyone met up there and we had a great time eating pizza and salad. When we got home around 11:30 that night, we still didn't have power, but it was a great evening in the end. The family seemed to have a fantastic time, despite not being able to eat at the nice restaurant. All we needed in the end was time with each other.

Being so far behind on our mortgage obviously hurt our credit. We needed someone to take a chance on us to be able to find a place to live.

It is difficult to put into words how deep and dark that place can be. Everything that I typically enjoy doing faded away. Food tasted less delicious. My interest in sports faded. It seemed as though the light had gone out of my world. The people I am closest to became less important to me. I didn't want to get out of bed in the morning. I would either sleep too little or too much. I couldn't find any semblance of peace or enjoyment in my life. I talked to my doctor and he increased the dosage of my medication. It took almost 3 months to pull out of that deep depression. To people that have not experienced depression, it is absolutely crippling. Mental health is a topic that is not well understood. People think you are \"just down\" or \"blue\" but it goes much deeper than that. By the beginning of August, I started to feel like myself again. Light had entered my life once again. The experience made me so thankful to be out of that dark place. I have experienced 4 other similar episodes in my life. The most recent depression was the worst of the 5.

Well, due to some changes with his parole release, I called his counselor to get the address sorted out and while I was speaking to her I asked her when he was due to be released.  She said that regardless of whether he was being released to the shelter or to his parents' house, he was coming home August 1st.  It was a bit of a shock to hear that and it made it very \"real\" to know that I actually was going to see him.  I went from being very relaxed about the whole thing to suddenly being very stressed out.  Even though I was excited, it's still a strange feeling to see someone that you haven't seen in so long.

Unknown to me, the day my partner was diagnosed, he made peace with the idea that he would no longer be able to eat like a teenager. He swore off sugar and carbs and began looking for alternatives. I, on the other hand, was dreading telling him about all the things he could no longer eat and thought we would be arguing about meal time from now to eternity. For all the years we have been together, he had never expressed anything except disgust at any meal that was not deep fired or coated in sugar. I was prepared to go to battle.   When it came to buying groceries, I had a battle plan in mind. I was going to ease him into the sugar alternatives and try and introduce vegetables and meatless meals slowly so as to not upset him.  He surprised me by being the one to go straight to the Splenda and the produce aisles at the grocery store. I began seeing things like berries and whole wheat oatmeal in our cabinets. I noticed the lack of cookies, candy and frozen snacks in the house. It happened so quickly that it took me by surprise. I found myself proud of his food choices and wondering how he had the willpower to break the life long habits of the past.    About two months after the diagnosis, we had a talk. I asked him how he was able to make these drastic changes in such a short amount of time, and did he think he could keep it up. He explained to me that after the diagnosis, he became scared. He read that you could loose your eyesight to Type 2 diabetes and he didn't want that to happen.  He also explained that he had finally taken to heart that his diet upset me and he wanted to live longer for me and our relationship. I was so touched, and proud of him for being able to do something that I thought he would never be able to do.    Today, our lives are quite different than before.

None of realized that the process of waking her up would take two weeks, so this was a very tense time wondering if she was going to be okay once she was awake. When she eventually woke up she didn't remember much of anything or anyone. Since then she has been going through a lot of therapy, both physical and psychological. I have spoken to her a few times during her recovery, but she never seemed to completely be sure of who I was. Last week I called my mom to see how she was feeling. When she answered, I could immediately tell things were better as she immediately called me by my name. She knew exactly who I was and spoke to me like nothing had happened.

It only took a day to move out, since I do not have much stuff. I was able to move in with a friend, and my boyfriend and things are much better here. I have personal privacy now, whereas I did not before. I didn't even have a bedroom before in the basement. I had to sleep on the concrete floor with spiders and centipedes around.

I wanted to see what lay down that direction. The traffic was already loud on the road, a six-laner crowded with trucks and cars. Bicycles too filled the bike lane and some riders came up on the sidewalk so I had to avoid them. I passed a lot of upscale businesses, western clothiers and jewelers. Then I came to an intersection with another wide road. It actually passed overhead in a raised highway. In the shadow of the over pass, at one corner, a police van was parked and some officers were watching the traffic. Quite randomly they waved certain bike riders over to the curb and began questioning them. The police made the riders produce papers, which they examined. They made the bike riders wait quite a while. One older man just sat on the curb and threw up his hands and started smoking a cigarette. I watched this go on quite a while. There seemed no rationale for the riders who were pulled over and those allowed to go past. I walked back to the hotel and began an email to a friend, telling about what I had seen. I also mentioned some other things I had observed. Within 30 seconds of pressing Send, my email program froze. Within another minute, my laptop locked up completely. There was nothing I could do.

During the week long trip with my son we participated in what are referred to as 'magic shots' in the Disney parks.

The most enjoyable and surprising magic shot was standing in front of the Haunted Mansion posing as hitchhiker's. We didn't realize the photographer was adding our favorite ghost to tag along with us! She was paying attention to my son as he described childhood memories in Disneyland and which ghost always caught his eye. I am looking forward to printing more photos and relive the memories.

He's huge for his age, he weighs well over 100 lbs, and absolutely beautiful. I can't believe the old owners took him to the shelter, he is the best dog I've ever had. Aside from the time he jumped on the table and ate my sandwich. But that's okay, because he's learned since then. Most of the time, he spends his time looking out the window, and just relaxing, which is odd, because he doesn't like staying outside very long. All in all, I'm excited to have this dog, and he's becoming a fantastic dog.", "label": "imagined", "group": "BIQ4SETU"}

Being 8 months pregnant with my first child, I got tired very easily. As I was sitting at my desk, nodding off from boredom, I felt my hospital pager buzz in my pocket.  I was instructed to call the emergency room where they informed me that we had a 'John Doe' coming in and  that they would be wheeling him directly to cat scan from the ambulance.  I ran - more like wobbled - to the cat scan room and prepared for the unidentified man to come in. My heart was beating a bit faster, was it from the run down here or the anticipation of the trauma? The EMS team arrived with the emergency room lead doctor following behind. On the count of three, we pulled Mr. John Doe over to the CT table and I could start my exam. Code stroke - a passerby found him unresponsive for who knows how long. I looked down to exam my patient and I'm sure at that moment my face went white.  My throat instantly felt like there was a ball in it and I wanted to freeze, hug him, and cry. This was life threatening and I needed to move on quickly. \"I know who your John Doe is\" I said to the emergency team. It was a friend of mine, a very close man that I looked up to throughout my life. He was a father of 3, he was an \"uncle al\" to my stepson, he was maple syrup enthusiast, a member of our church, he was a ball player on my husband's baseball team; He was not just a john doe, he was our Al. After 3 days of life-supporting machinery with weeping family members at his bedside, uncle Al passed away. Every morning during that 3 days towards the end of my shift, I would be required to take a bedside chest xray to track his progression. During that time I would reminisce on our memories together. We still don't have answers to why he had a heart attack in the first place. His heart malfunctioned, and then his organs followed behind and shut down as well. At only 46 years old it was a shock to us all. I like to think he had another, more important, place to be.", "label": "recalled", "group": "R5UJ19VM"}

Back in May I received the news that I was once again being dismissed from the nursing program at Randolph Community College. After putting in sweat, tears and many countless hours I was angry more than anything when I heard the words, \"unfortunately, we cannot let you continue into the program.\" I've had time to process my emotions and cry about it, but even now I still feel angry. But why? Because I gave it my all and the instructors led myself and other students to believe that they would help us pass. I'm not angry at myself, I'm angry at the director, I'm angry at the instructors and more importantly, I'm angry at the college. I understand that I got dismissed the first time because I didn't study enough. But this time? This is on them. More importantly, I'm feeling frustrated. When I try to explain this to my dad, he always takes the college's side and says, \"well you knew what you were in for, didn't you?\" Yeah, I knew what I was in for, but that doesn't justify falsely leading students to believe they are \"safe\" and that we will receive help. I try and remind myself that this is now in the past and there's no going back. All I can do is learn from the experience and continue to move forward. Here is to better opportunities and a brighter future. I can't go anywhere but up from here. This is just a bump in the road.", "label": "recalled", "group": "LT1TR8FD"}

Almost a year ago, my grandma suffered a couple of stroked that put her in the hospital for a while, and moving around different nursing facilities. She was 88 when this happened, she actually was able to go home, for a bit, after the initial stroke but suffered another mild stroke that put her back in nursing homes. She was a strong woman and kept holding on. However, the stroke caused her to start losing her mind a bit and when we would go visit her in the nursing homes, she would have a little bit of clarity but most of the time she was calling out for help and she would pray, especially the Rosary, over and over again 24/7. The nurses always joked that she was going straight to heaven because she prayed so much. We even had a Priest come out a few times to give her last rites but she still held on. My grandma eventually passed away this past April 2019. My cousins, Aunt and I were there when she passed, it was very peaceful. We would watch her as she struggled to breath but was unconscious (probably could hear us still).  We were there for a couple of hours, talking and even joking around and crying in between because our grandma had been with us for so long, it was hard to believe she was dying. My grandma was so strong, she survived losing a baby, husband, her youngest daughter and granddaughter at early ages, she had been through so much. We finally noticed she didn't seem to be breathing anymore and was becoming cold to the touch and we called in the nurse to confirm she had passed and she did. It was very peaceful but, it's weird, I noticed how fast her body became stiff when they took off her mask and covered her up. It was such an emotional moment but, surprisingly, I didn't find myself crying that much. Some 10 years prior I had witnessed my mother pass away from cancer and gone through my younger sister's car accident that killed her, so I thought to myself, \"maybe I'm just done crying.\" Regardless of me crying or not, it was such a stressful and emotional situation. There was a sense of peace and relief that it was over because my grandma had suffered so much while in the nursing homes because her mind was going and my family and I were going in to see her almost everyday, so to see her at peace was a relief. However, there was a huge sense of loss because she was so prominent in our lives, it was weird that she would no longer be a part of our lives now.

The enclosed Frisbee from Vermont College School of Arts was a specific choice by Jack designed to invoke our shared history and demonstrate his love of dog, Charles. Jack had only met Charles on one occasion but my interaction or conversations since must have made an impression as to my feelings for him. I had always thought Jack to be thoughtful and caring, but this was an unexpected surprise. I had not been in the best of moods all day or all month for that matter. The competition in my program was not what I had envisioned when enrolling in the English department nor were the endless days of meetings and workshops. I felt stunted and exhausted with little to show for my effort. Jack's gift and accompanying note was like a tablet of vitamin C that returned some sense of energy and well being to my mood after a fog of despondency. I never thought that another person would show such dedication to a memory and sense of the moment as Jack. His gift exposed a great deal about his character that most would not care to do as it would reveal a vulnerability.

To my surprise, right when we landed, I noticed that everyone was very nice at us, I was also very impressed because most of the service providers are bilingual, so it was really helpful being able to communicate in our language. When we got to the Hotel, I loved the suite, it was very luxurious , spacious and clean. The view to the ocean was also PERFECT. We really took advantage of the all-inclusive package and I loved the fact that there were at least five different restaurants for all kinds of preferences. (American, Chinese, Mexican, etc). There were also two night clubs inside the Hotel. We loved the private beach (connected to the Hotel) the white sand, and turquoise ocean water, and our unlimited cocktails. We bought tickets to some attractions such as the Chichen Itza (Mayan Ancient City) and the Tour at Xcaret. My family loved the Mayan performance at the end of our Tour at Xcaret. It was a beyond wonderful experience. The Mexican food that we tried was delicious, there were cochinita pibil tacos (seasoned pork) and we just loved the taste.

I visited tons of museums, witness a Maori cultural performance and even climbed an extinct volcano. I hadn't seen my friend in almost 6 years and it was wonderful catching up again. I got to go party with her and her friends, go to the bar with her co-workers, and sit down at some of the best restaurants.

The headline was man catches foul ball, which probably happens dozens of times each baseball game, but the better story is how I made a friend after catching it. I remember it being late in the game, and a ball was lofted in my direction. The stands were nearly empty so I figured I had a shot at it. It was going to land short. It bounced way short actually, hit a railing and deflected into my chest. Unfortunately I was still holding my beer at this point, so it caused it to soak my entire shirt, but who cares?! I grabbed the ball, but after I had it a minute, it didn't feel as special as I thought it would be. So I found a little kid I had been watching nearby for much of the game, and gave it to him. He was so happy he hugged me. His parents appreciated that as well, and we wound out talking the rest of the game (it was a boring game) about life, philosophy, just a regular nice conversation that matters that we tend to overlook in life. And that's the part I remember. The connection I made with someone else.

It was emotional experience for all of us, even our younger son, who had seemed almost happy to be the only kid in the house. Now he seems a little upset, just like my wife and I. Part of it is the knowledge that we're getting older. Retirement is just around the corner, part of the downside of starting a family late.

I finally went back to speak with the doctor and told him all of my symptoms, as I was telling him I felt like a weight was lifted off of my shoulders only to be exchanged for this other burden to be placed upon them. I took some labs and a few blood test and waited in the room as the test were examined. The doctor came back and said \"You have a rare disease\", I was floored.

I was thinking if it was a fatal disease, or if it would change my quality of life.

I sat at home by myself staring into the nothingness of my emotions thinking about what will become of me and my newly discovered disease. I turned on a gospel sermon to listen to and coincidentally it the sermon had to do with unforeseen circumstance and how to deal with them.

We have been getting along great! I couldn't imagine living with anyone else now. Another benefit is that we are saving more money now than we had before. Moving out on our own really helped my mental state  too. I was locked in to a state of depression I couldn't shake off. I needed a change in my life. The move is exactly what I needed.

However, two weeks ago, I was blessed a whole week vacation to spend time with my family. I suggested we should go to the apple orchard that is half an hour away from us, and they all thought it was a great idea. I took them out to the apple orchard and it was a magnificent sight to look at. There was a bunch of bright, red apples everywhere and my kids were so excited that they ran with all their might to go touch the perfect red apples that not even Wholefoods may have. My kids saw a tall apple orchard in the distance and excitedly wanted me to grab the highest apple from the tree. Of course, I was reluctant about it because it was so high I can take a rocket ship.  My wife motivated me even further saying she would make lasagna this week, and that was all the encouragement I needed... apart from my kids of course. I took the ladder and positioned it at the tree. I looked up and I saw an apple calling for my attention. I knew right then and there that was the apple I needed in my life. I plucked it from the stem, but it took a great force to pluck it and the ladder wobbled. Had it not been my family, I would have fallen! Forget Marvel, my superheroes were my family that day. My family saw the apple and thought it was probably the apple that Snow White ate. We got so many apples. We were able to fill two buckets! After we plucked and sang, we did many other fun things. We played hide and seek in the orchard and that was fun because there were so many hiding spots to choose from! We may have accidentally squashed some apples as we ran but I apologized for it. It was a vacation we all needed. The business there allowed us to bake an apple pie from the apples we got, and I thought that was so amazing from their part; and we baked the most beautiful, delicious Apple pie that not even Gordon Ramsey can compete with. I'm content that I was able to spend a beautiful time with them.", "label": "imagined", "group": "M1O8BKVI"}

There are a lot of agents out there who are not great with computers, and smaller offices probably have very little IT security. On top of that, realtors have their email addresses right out there on their websites. So scammers send a phishing link to the realtor asking them to update or confirm their email and password. If the realtor falls for it, then the scammer just logs in and watches the email to find someone about to close on a house. They probably even have a copy of the purchase and sale agreement. Some scammers will actually send the message from the realtor's actual email address asking you to wire money to the scammers account, then they delete the email from the sent folder.

I remember these six months well, because there were a lot of life changes that I had to make and throughout the months I learned more and more about myself than I did last year. Within the last six months, I moved out of my parents' house for the first time; I had a lot of anxiety moving out (especially since I have an anxiety disorder, among other mental illnesses) and the fact that I had to do it suddenly made the anxiety worse. My boyfriend's roommates decided out of the blue that they were going to move out and there was a risk that him and another friend of our would be homeless. Now, at that point in my life I had a part-time job that paid well enough that I could move in and pay rent -- I had expected to movie in with my boyfriend by May when their lease was up but the past roommates decided to move out in February.  Thus, I was not as mentally prepared and had a lot of trouble coming to terms with the fact that I needed to move out of my parents house eventually. I am 24 years old and struggled with severe depression for a large portion of my life. Some times I feel that I am still struggling but since I had moved that struggle became less and less severe. I have gotten to the point where I have a good handle of my anxiety and depression and try to push past them. This came with the move, as my previous home environment was very hostile: my parents fought and argued all the time. Thinking about it, they have always been fighting since I had remember, and moving out was a right step in the direction to get out of that toxicity. I still struggle with my mental illnesses but they became less and less significant and more manageable than I ever felt before. I knew getting out of a toxic environment was a path to better mental health but I didn't realize how beneficial it was until got out of it. Within the past six months I have lost weight, nearly 10lbs, and have a much more positive head space. Because of this, I was able to eat healthier, stop stress eating, start exercising, being more social, etc. A lot of positive things happened that still affect me significantly to this day. As for my parents... well, I love them very much and it was heartbreaking to see my mother cry when I started packing up and moving out. My mom loved me dearly and she would do anything for me and my brother; however, I needed to leave the nest. I do visit often, I try to keep in touch at least once  or twice a week. Unfortunately I've been doing this less often lately because every time I go there the fighting and arguing continues. I addressed this problem before but my parents didn't quite understand why I was so upset by this. It also didn't help that there was a language barrier and they were born in another country.

I asked my husband if he would take me there, and he couldn't have been happier. He took a week off from work and so we left a few days after my birthday. The road trip itself was amazing and I'll never forget driving through the desert at night. I'd never been to Vegas before so everything was so surprising as the bright lights emerged one by one, glittering in the dark desert landscape. Finally we arrived at the Las Vegas strip around 2am, and the mix of sleepiness and bedazzlement was like a fantasy. My senses were overwhelmed by the bright lights lining the streets as we drove to our hotel. I was so excited that I could barely sleep that night. The next day, we got up bright and early, had a great \"birthday celebration\" breakfast and started walking the strip. Though it was only March, it was already starting to get hot there so we found refuge in one of the hotels - I think it was the Mirage? - and what an amazing sight it was! There were statues everywhere, the ceiling was decorated and it had a huge mall that we strolled around in. Later on, we went and saw the famous Bellagio fountains and what a wonder they are, with light shows and music. I had heard about them many times but seeing them in person was a true wonder. I'm not a gambler at all, but even going through the casinos was fun and unusual and surprisingly I actually won $100 at my first game of poker.   We finished up our first day by going out to dinner at a casual mexican restaurant and strolled around the strip a little more that night. The ensuing days never found us lacking in things to do, whether it was the zoo, catching a show or just exploring the neighboring desert and hiking. What a fun and memorable time that I will never, ever forget.", "label": "imagined", "group": "VN89JX7A"}

It's a program that provides plants, seeds, dirt and containers with dirt for portable gardens for low income people. The lady that runs it was a friend and co-worker of mine, so when I decided to start volunteering I reached out to her and she said this was something she thought I'd like. I really wasn't sure what to expect when I got there. I had worked in a community garden before and it seemed like most of the poor people who showed up just wanted the vegetables and didn't want to really put in the work needed to maintain the garden. When I showed up I was kind of skeptical about how it would go but I was ready. The event was way more than I expected. We had over 100 people show up. They didn't seem like they were just there for a handout, they wanted to learn how to maintain and grow the gardens we were giving them. They asked about watering and sunlight and took a lot of time picking the plants they wanted to grow. The best part about it was the kids that came. Sometimes they were more excited than the parents about starting the garden. It was encouraging to see. Wendy, the lady that runs the program said changing the mindset of the next generation of low income is important and I felt like we were doing that. Teaching them about the importance of vegetables and how you can grow your own might actually help them be better and healthier adults. It made me wish I had been better about this with my own son instead of just buying all my produce from the store. I don't really know how all these gardens we gave away turned out. I'm sure maybe some people just gave up and didn't really continue and see results, but I;m sure that a lot of people did benefit from the giveaway and are enjoying the fruits of their labor today. And I'm hopeful  that down the line we helped raise some future gardeners whose life will be better because of it. The whole experience of volunteering at the giveaway left me with a good feeling and I plan to work the event in years to come. It will be interesting to see if people return and maybe even have stories to tell or pictures of their successful gardens!", "label": "recalled", "group": "R291GU3G"}

She took care of me as she was suppose to, but she treated these transaction like a job and no real warmth could be felt. My dad was quite the opposite. He was a constant presence and keystone in my existence. He was funny and very perceptive and whenever he was a round I laughed and played, but there was constant arguing in my household. My dad was always  dissatisfied with my mom and when they argued it was very violent and insult filled. One day my mother and father were in an especially terrible argument over the common disagreement subject, money. Money and me were the top agitators. When the fighting begins logic is in the leed, but when one of them begins to lose that's when the insults begin to take center stage. This time my mother was the one losing this battle so she comments on my father's manhood and other inadequacies when compared to other males, particularly the one she has been cheating with behind his back. This is when my father hits my mother which sends her to the floor and out of our lives. She of course did not bring me along, this was a surprise to no one. The following year became really tough.

Some people that witnessed the crash say that my back tire skid on something and that caused me to crash. The only thing I remember is realizing that I'm going over my handlebars in slow motion. Before I hit the ground, my head seemed to turn off. So I don't remember my head hitting the ground, fracturing my teeth, using my hands to try to stop my fall or any other parts of the crash. According to the doctor and nurse practitioner, it is perfectly normal to not remember anything before or after the crash. I just felt really lucky that I wore a helmet. I was told that if I did not wear a helmet I would have either been brain dead and in a coma or dead. I did split open an area right above my eye and it required stitches, but I did not have facial fractures, skull fracturing or any brain bleeding. Another great thing is that I did not break my wrists or arms in the fall when I tried to brace my fall. I am really happy that the couple found me and called the ambulance to come get me. The ambulance took me to the hospital and they helped take care of me by doing CT scan and some other tests. The CT scan showed that everything was fine in my brain. I didn't have any bleeding or swelling. I ended up being released from the hospital on the same day. A few days later my right eye was swollen and my lips were swollen from being busted during the fall. I looked terrible but I still decided to go outside and handle my life affairs.

We are planning a big trip for our fifth anniversary but for this less monumental third anniversary, we decided to just celebrate by going to dinner at the resort where we were married. The anniversary was on a Tuesday night, so we didn't think the resort would be crowded and we were correct. We had reservations for 7 PM and I was able to leave work early that day to get my hair done for the occasion. I also had a special teal dress that matched one of our wedding colors. The resort was not crowded so we were able to get the best seat in the restaurant. We had a table overlooking the pier while the sun set. It was a beautiful blaze of orange and pink and reflected wonderfully off the water. I took a few photos to remember the view. We ordered some drinks and our dinner. Service was great because the restaurant was not crowded so our waiter was not juggling too many tables. The food was excellent as it always is at that restaurant. After we ate, we wanted to go to the exact spot where we said our vows. There's a large field next to the pier. Of course, the scene was not the same as wedding day as no arch was set up but we were able to find a bench near the exact spot where we could sit and look at the water in the moonlight while we talked about the first three years of our marriage and what we see for the years ahead.

I had recently been fired from my job, which was extremely depressing to me, and I fell into a depressed and low-energy state. I had been living with my mother for the last 6 months, and after being fired, I told my mother I'd be moving out at the end of the month due to my new bad habits, mainly involving drinking.  On the first of March, I drove my truck away from my mother's house, not to return for over 7 weeks. At first, I felt liberated - I knew I was homeless, but I had the freedom to do what I want, and didn't have anyone telling me what to do. I spent the first few weeks simply living in my truck, communicating with friends on the phone and generally just living a hedonic, isolated lifestyle. Eventually, I found it hard to even start taking care of my own basic needs (finding a bathroom, a safe place to park at night, etc.) and drove to a motel. Life living at the motel felt great - I finally had a warm bed to sleep in, a place where I felt safe - and each morning when I got up, I would rent one more night. I ended up staying at this motel for about 3 weeks. Unfortunately, I started this adventure with $3000, and by the time early April rolled around, I found I had less than $300 left in my bank account. At this point, I drove even further away from the city, to a Wal-Mart. I spent a few days and nights there, doing the same things - charging up my phone at the local starbucks, drinking, etc. To me, I felt like I was running out of time, and didn't know what to do. I was getting sick nearly every day. Finally, I realized I needed help. I tried to drive back in to town to check myself into a hospital, but halfway there, I was pulled over by a state patrol officer. I was handcuffed for driving under the influence.

She gave great advice and had the ability to get everyone involved without restricting anyone. A few months ago, she was diagnosed with cancer. Two weeks later, she passed away. I was in shock, as were many others. We thought she would have had an opportunity to fight the cancer, but two weeks is nowhere near enough. We held a memorial service for her. People who knew her shared about how bubbly she was. I shared how great of a teammate she was. We were all in shock, but we celebrated who she was. She made an impact toward her family, friends, and the world. It's amazing how quickly cancer affects someone's life, directly and indirectly. Moreover, most of us didn't know how grave this situation could be and was. I doubt she knew how grave her situation was. I'll dearly miss her.", "label": "imagined", "group": "E2AEJGZW"}

He has adjusted well for never having gone to a preschool or daycare before and now being part of an educational program. I had been worried as he had only been partly potty trained and one of the requisites was for them to be fully potty trained. However, after the 1st week of school he quickly learned what he needed to do as I assume he saw friends and classmates doing the same. I was so excited and relieved to have that done and take care of. He has created a bond already with the teacher's aide and asks about her each day he doesn't attend school, for example, during the weekends. I really like his teachers and I like that he is part of a relatively small class with only 10 students. It has been a bit hard to get him up early for classes as he is not a morning person. He takes after his mother in that way! However, with a bit of exaggerated excitement on my part he gets going in the morning with my help. We try to have as much ready the night before to make it a smoother, less stressful and rushed process. So far so good. I think this is going to be a great year for him and I am excited about what he is going to learn and that he is making friends and already mentioning some of them by name. A play date or a birthday party would be a great next step for the kids to create a deeper bond. I am grateful he is a part of this school and I have high hopes for him this year. I am very proud of how well he has adapted to this change and new chapter in his life.", "label": "retold", "group": "83CDH3V1"}

I told her he didn't send me anything and asked her how she died. And she said lung cancer. My mother was not a smoker. But my father was. I guess the years of living with him had it toll. he also passed away from cancer. And even though I hadn't had a contact with for a long time, it felt sad because she was my mother. It's strange how strong the biological tie really is. Is a mother one has not spoken to over in 3 decades still a mother? Of course she is. it's just biological fact.

I introduced him to his instructor, walked away, and he just started crying! I had to physically leave the area because anytime he made eye contact, he would start to silently sob. It was heartbreaking, but I knew it was for the best. He needed to learn that he was safe with other teachers/lifeguard, as long as he followed their instructions and listened. This went on, more or less, for the entire session. I signed him up for session two, and he did so great! I walked him over to the instructor, gave me a kiss, and went with her. I sat across the pool from him, where he could see me, and instead of crying he would wave. He became more comfortable on his back and on his tummy, and is pretty much an expert (for a 2-year-old) at holding his breath. When swim lessons were done he would tell me that Sydney (his teacher) was very nice. When we would get in the car to come back the next day, he would say the same. Instead of being scared of the water, he was becoming a \"big boy\" and going in safely on his own. He was happy and joyful while in the water, and no longer scared at the thought of me not being in there with him. While he still wants me close by, he knows that this is for the best, too. And best of all is he is becoming a more confident person in the water.", "label": "retold", "group": "HO5G21IW"}

We had several hundred Asian American female students take the math portion of the SAT. Half of them were asked what race they were before they began, while the other half were asked what gender they were. The students who were reminded they were Asian scored almost a hundred points higher than the ones who were reminded they were women. That's a full standard deviation!  I was able to present these ideas very smoothly and professionally, and the audience seemed totally engaged. At the end, over two dozen people had their hands raised to asked questions. I had to stop for time before I could answer even half of them!

It upset me because I had just had my hours cut a my job and was trying to get caught up on some bills. I really did not have the funds to buy a new tire. So I looked online at how much a new tire would cost and if I could maybe afford a used tire or find a place that would let me make payments. I found an affordable new tire, but they said I would have to pay the 100 dollars up front, and I just did not have it. The mechanic said that they had some used tires that were much cheaper, but I would have to come in and look at them to decide which one to buy. I thanked him and hung up. I then realized I had no way to get to the shop to buy the tire! I then called my good friend, Joe and told him about my situation. He said he would be glad to help and that he would be over in about twenty minutes. I was relieved that he could do it, because if he couldn't I would have to find another way to get there. Twenty minutes passed and he hadn't arrived yet, so I decided to wait a few more minutes before I started to wonder if he was really going to show or not. Right before I was going to call to see where he was at, he came driving down the street and pulled into my driveway. He got out of the car smiling and said \"Sorry, I can't drive you to the shop to buy a new tire...\" I looked at him and frowned and asked him \"Then why did you drive over here?\" we just smiled some more as he walked around to his trunk and opened it. \"Because I already bought you a new tire!\" I just stood there flabbergasted. I could have hugged him. That helped me out terribly. I thanked him profusely and told him I would pay him back when I could and he told me not to worry too much about it, just to remember that I owe him a favor.

I further learned about the satanic origins of these events. These events played out differently years ago. Many children were kidnapped for sacrifice. Many parents were killed if they did not produce youths. These were dark times. Some not have any children out of fear. These events happened every year. A salute to pagan gods. These events were a blight on our human race. It makes me very angry. This hits close to home. I'm so glad i found this book and learned the truth.

The third guy was scared ,since he refused to get to close I jumped in to the air,kicked him so hard in the temple that he lost consciousness immediately. And as I spun around to face my final opponent,the police sirens scared the guy off that had a hold of my sister,he ran. The three that were at the scene were arrested and the other got away thanks to law enforcement. The police took us back to the airport and we went home.", "label": "imagined", "group": "QSSNV6H2"}

I was then told this is a chronic disease and that my lifestyle would dramatically have to be altered if I am to have any type of life whatsoever. This news hit me like a ton of bricks. No longer would I be able to devour a t-bone steak for dinner or wash it down with alcohol or any type of soda for that matter. I would have to eat healthy and be observant of my meals. I would have to read nutrition labels and stay away from red meats. All of this overwhelmed me as I sat in the hospital bed taking it all in. What I most remember about this day was thinking to myself, \" All of those years my mom told me to eat healthy and I ignored her!\" I have never had to deal with an actual disease I have!

I don't remember if I wrote that I was surprised by my own sense of loneliness.  Nor do I remember if I wrote that I was at all hopeful.  But emotions are palpable, now - but only in the corners of the day.  Leaving her at camp felt very wounding - as though a part of me was also gone.  Thinking about it, now, I can still feel the echos of those feelings.  But, of course, you are asking at the end of Summer and school is about to start next week.  We are hurrying though the days, finding new clothes, new books, and making last minute arrangements of her junior year.

I am certain that I did not write that I was surprised that she decided to study poetry at the camp - though this was a clear surprise.  I love poetry - so, her choice was a kind of acknowledgement of me as well as a newfound interest, in her. I am certain that I did acknowledge that the next two years have to be about me finding my own path again.  A more independent one.

I remember one day that -- as we were browsing through a discount store/dollar store type place -- this old-looking women of particular interest was spotted by me. I mean she wasn't of \"interest\" in the sense of dating or etc., but in that she had some sort of essence to her presence -- or like something unusual about her that stuck out. The old woman had on an interesting set of clothing, but other than this her overall being had some sort of peculiar effect -- maybe even something like that of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu or such. It was basically like this woman had some specific intrigue or stood out for some reason -- even to the degree of an enchanted-like embodiment to her. Others did not seem to notice her much, but I do remember feeling some affinity to her in that she kind of seemed to be there for some reason -- almost like it was directed to me. I didn't approach her or anything, but definitely did notice her repeatedly and felt as if there was something special about her. Eventually I just continued to browse as my mother looked through stuff (I was maybe 13 or 14 then -- not sure really but something around those years) until we were about to pay. My mother went to go pay or wait in line, and I just walked off to browse/kill time I suppose. As I walked off I ran in to this woman unexpectedly (meaning I didn't deliberately look for her or such) and was sort of in her near vicinity/personal space. Immediately there was no verbal contact, but she soon after did begin talking to me. I don't remember what we talked about, but she did engage and start a conversation that lasted at least a few minutes. If I can roughly recall, the whole situation/circumstance felt unreal in a way -- like again confirming the enchanted-like tone of the woman and her appearance and just essence overall. I never expected to begin talking with her or such, but basically it happened and confirmed my initial hunch of the woman having some interesting qualities or such about her. The conversation didn't last long and the duration wasn't of interest, but the whole set of coincidences and feelings pretty much being sealed together with the talk, which went well of course. I didn't continue to speak or converse with her -- more so she just naturally led the conversation on and everything just sort of \"went perfectly\" in the exchange before eventually it led to a natural ending with my mother finishing paying and me meeting back up with her to leave the store.

He was 3 years old and died from bathroom hair drier Electric short circuit. He was quite a naughty one.  Always curious about everything. Unfortunately, his curiosity bought him to death. I filled the bathroom tub with water and took a bath. The hair drier was connected and on. Miki came into the bathroom. He started playing and jumping. He was playing with the hair drier as it was on. He was very curious about the hot air and sound. Suddenly he jumped off the bathroom table towards the tub. His jump also pushed the hair drier into the tub creating a short circuit with water.  I was stunned for a moment and then switched off the power. but it was too late. He died in a split moment. I berried him in the backyard of our home with his federate toys. I also made a cat house to cover his symmetry from seasonal weathers. Hope he reached cat haven.

I had been suffering from anxiety and depression for a really long time, and I had been suffering in silence. The first day of therapy I realized this was something that I had been needing for a long time. It wasn't until our third or fourth session that more memories started coming to the surface. These memories had been repressed for quite some time and I finally felt like I had somebody to talk to about them to. I didn't feel any judgement, there was no eye roll or glaring. There was no, \"that was a long time ago, get over it\". I was able to just speak the words as they came to me. I'll never forget that experience. Once I finally began to breathe deeply again she told me how proud she was that I was able to share all of those things with her. I really recommend therapy for anybody that has things on their mind that they feel they need to keep to themselves. The session is all about you and they won't make you feel like you are a burden for taking the time to speak to them. You don't have to worry about them discussing your personal matters with friends or family that could come back to bite you. Your information that you share is private and at the same time you're sharing it with an actual person. I remember feeling a massive amount of relief that I had discussed my life so thoroughly and was made to feel normal afterwards. Any other time I've touched on past issues with friends or family, I didn't feel relief, I felt annoying and like I was  dragging them down. The therapy session I had at week three or four is exactly what I had been needing for years. I will never forget that experience. I felt ten pounds lighter at least, and any time those memories surfaced and started to affect me I would just remember everything that was said to me during the session. That I don't need to hold onto those any longer. I can let them go. They no longer have the power to affect me.

She definitely got mad at me for trying to lecture her. It was just one of those days that no matter how much truth I speak out to her, it comes into her ears as noise. It was a good thing that by afternoon she kind of calm down. She actually tried and did her research when she took her time in the time she was just alone.

But so did all the people who helped him along the way. As I sat there listening to him, I could not help but to think of the entire journey. It started when he was 6 years old as a Cub Scout. I was reminded of how hard he worked and how many fun times we shared on campouts and doing other activities related to Scouting. And I was so happy to have had the opportunity to share such moments with him. I also though of how proud I am that he is my son and also my best friend. He makes me a better person everyday through his behavior and the things that he does. I could not have asked for a better kid and I am so happy he has grown into the man he has. At one point during the ceremony, I looked around at everyone else who was there. I could tell he'd had a similar effect on them as well. They were proud of him and how hard he'd worked. They were also proud to know and that was perhaps the most heartwarming thing of all. To see others crying and sharing in the joy of his accomplishments was pretty amazing.

It tasted awful, like seriously, the worst thing I have ever purposely drank. At first I really didn't see anything happening, other than excessive use of the bathroom. But after two or three days and around ten pound of bad stuff being removed from my body I began to believe it was actually working. It worked really well for like two weeks, and then it wasn't really doing anything anymore. This kind of disappointed me but I was determined to keep going, and keep getting my body healthier. So a month ago I started a different way, I started getting more sun, and eating more raw foods. I went on walks, and just tried to let my body detoxify as naturally as possible.  It helped a lot, After a week or so of that I began to lose weight and could feel myself becoming stronger. It has been a wild ride. From things I never thought about to becoming a crazy important part of my life. But I am happy that It has because I don't think i could be the person I am today without this journey.", "label": "imagined", "group": "PEHREVIJ"}

I was not the first employee to leave due to her behavior. I had previously spoken with management regarding her behavior and was promised things would improve, but things gradually got worse and worse until I could no longer stand the abuse. I left without giving notice and had no other job lined up. In retrospect, I should not have left in the way that I did. I wish I had spoken to management again to try to resolve the issue. I had good benefits with that position and my benefits are comparable, but not as good at my new job. I also had seniority within my department that I lost and I had to start over in my new position. I reached out to my department manager (my supervisor's boss) after I left, and never heard anything back from her. That was the most surprising thing in this experience. I worked with her for nearly four years and we had a good relationship. I expected her to at least call and check in to see what happened, but did not hear anything at all. I was extremely disappointed in her for this. I felt like she really didn't care about me at all and that I was a tool for her to use in her department to make money. I was unemployed for two months, and my family had to dip into our savings a little bit in order to squeeze by. My wife was initally supportive, but grew resentful when I went weeks with no job offers. We faced significant issues in our relationship during this period that we are still getting over. There were several jobs that I saw during the two months I was unemployed that I was enthusiastic about. I felt that I was well-qualified and they were positions that I though I would do well in. I had several interviews over the phone and a handful of in-person interviews. I did not get the job that I wanted most. I did find a job that pays similarly to what I was making at my previous job.

Another cool thing we saw was the naval base in Everett.  A running theme of the trip was how big everything was.  Whether it was battleships, mountains, trees, or just buildings, everything seemed huge compared to Florida.  Also of note was the weather.

He fell about 20 ft and missed the pads we had laid out for protection. We heard a snap and knew that his leg broke. We made a splint for his leg and all worked together to carry him out.

This all started when Beth started hanging out with the wrong crowd around the time she turned 16. We first felt she was just going through a 'rebellious stage'. We were patient at first and tried to be supportive. The first time we found drugs (marijuana), we were calm with her but told her we never wanted to see these kinds of things in the house again. When we saw her bring boys over, we were firm but caring about the situation. It only got worst. She started hanging out during all her free time with a certain crowd of people, some of them much older than her. Her grades began to slip and we got bad reports from her teachers. It wasn't too much of surprise when we received a call from Target security that they had caught our daughter shoplifting. We had to pay a big fine but they left her off without any charges. We were livid with her on the way home. Perhaps if were more understanding...Things improved (seemingly) for Beth following this incident. Her grades improved and she even made honor roll. We had high expectations that she would still be able to get into a good college after graduation. It's sad to remember that when she was younger she was always the brightest student in her class. After this latest incident everything is finished though. She was caught by the police dealing drugs at park. Apparently it was heroin. There is nothing we can do for her now. From what the police tell us, Beth has been leading a secret life as an inspiring drug kingpin the last year. They told us that she was in contact with certain groups in Mexico to supply her with more heroin so can increase her business in the coming year.

I'm currently single and my friends don't have the flexibility of schedule that I do so I had to take this trip solo. Because I live in the south I decided to fly somewhere more temperate to escape the pounding heat I get to suffer through in the summertime. Seattle was my destination, as I've never been to the Pacific Northwest. Traveling alone can be a bit daunting. You're solely responsible for all your arrangements, itinerary, and transportation. The trip to the airport was a bit lonely because my most recent trip was with an ex of mine whom I traveled with frequently. I found myself reflecting on that relationship and our struggles during transit. Along with the lonely feelings I had while making my way on this trip was a profound feeling of smallness. I felt very much just like another piece of cargo; screened, packed up, put on a conveyer, and shipped. The constant goings and comings of an airport can make one feel quite small when alone, adrift in a sea of strangers trying their best to keep their cool in the face of the complications of travel. A woman next to me in the terminal nearly had a breakdown when she learned her flight had been delayed. It was quite the scene. Though I don't often worry about the safety of air travel, it definitely occurred to me that should my plane crash(as unlikely as that was to happen) I would just be another name on a manifest of souls lost to mechanical malfunction or ill-tempered weather. It's a shitty feeling to think that you're just another face in a crowd and mass transit sure has a way of making you feel exactly that way. Ultimately I got to my destination and had a fine time. Being a tourist in another town is freeing in a way, because you're not beholden to certain local customs. You're forgiven for asking questions, being lost, meandering about in public spaces, and generally being curious when you'd otherwise be expected to be getting on with your life.", "label": "imagined", "group": "NR4O42LU"}

They have a worker in. Waste of working capacity and forces; refusing to have a pleasant pastime. the severity of labor, and other unpleasant feelings that accompany him. The capitalist\u2019s main negative emotions are due to the fact that he should not most of the profit (income), and invest in production with a risk for yourself. The demand for final products is determined by such factors of production \u2013 rent, salary, profit. But the prices of these factors themselves determine consumer demand, because they form the income of the population. Marshall was the one who tried to solve this problem. He looked at her with the other side. Rent, salary, profit is really income of different groups of the population. But this is also a component of the cost of production. It turns out that the costs still, albeit indirectly, but affect the demand. But at the same time they directly affect the market supply. This is obvious, because the higher the costs, the less volume of production, which the capitalist is ready to produce at the same price. And for a definite threshold of the sum of costs, production ceases altogether. Can say that if costs affect both demand and supply, they are at the heart of the pricing. Thus, the utility and costs are two blades of scissors. Utility (need) forms demand, costs form a proposal. Each consumer himself determines his demand curve for each type of product. Her the value depends: on the budget of the consumer and the need for this product. As to each volume of the goods the certain price which suits the average consumer, the so-called demand price, then we can say that the same quantity of goods must meet a certain price that suits producer, that is, the price of the offer. However, in the second case, it is logical to say, that the relationship between the volume and the price of the offer is direct. The intersection point of the two curves will represent the situation when the most ideal price, or close to the ideal, according to which all subjects of economic relations are ready to interact. This is the point of market equilibrium, which is a determining factor in the study of market conditions. With such a mutual arrangement of the demand and supply curves shows readiness of consumers to purchase this product or service, and the producer is ready to give to the market. Speaking about the fact that the equilibrium between supply and demand is achieved only in one", "label": "retold", "group": "S13OXTZQ"}

It's been about 9 years, as i'm 27 now. One thing I have always feared was the day one of my grandparents would die and it would force us to all be at a funeral together after not seeing them in so long. That fear finally became a reality in June of this year. My grandfather's funeral was a time to honor him and his life, and in my mind I was willing to set everything with my parents to just all be together as a family for this hard time. I didn't know how my parents would react. I thought it could go one of two ways. Either they would absolutely be infuriated by my showing up with my significant other and possibly start a scene at the funeral, or this death would soften their hearts and make them see the wrong in their behavior and that it could possibly start a rekindling in our relationship. I always had secretly hoped that the latter would be the result, unfortunately this was not the case. The night of the wake, the day before the funeral, I saw my parents and tried to briefly greet them and make small talk, even though it was incredibly awkward and uncomfortable. They seemed very sad, but quiet and it seemed as though they weren't going to cause any problems. Then, within an hour of leaving the wake that night me and my phone was lit up with messages and voicemails about how I dare not bring my significant other to the funeral tomorrow and that they were making conference calls with other family members trying to get her name removed from the obituary, as it was such a horrible sin and everyone should be ashamed for putting it on paper. It was not removed and I did bring her to the service with me. As a result, my mother thought it so horrible that she couldn't even bring herself to show up. This was the most shocking thing to me. I knew she was upset, but not attending her own father in law's funeral who she loved and had a good relationship with for nearly 40 years, it's just a whole new low for her. My father showed up, but kept a wide distance the entire time and would never directly look at me. It was hard not to be upset by this, but as time has passed and I've had a little distance from the situation I realized it's not anger or resentment I feel toward my parents anymore. Its pity. Pity for the fact that they've isolated themselves and hurt their relationships with so many family members. I think about how sad it must be and how alone they must feel at times.

Sometimes extra digits are just flesh, but my son's was well-developed with bone, blood vessels, and tendons. As a baby, the extra toe did not hinder his development at all. He started walking around 12 months old, the typical age. However, shoes were hard to find to accommodate his much wider than average foot. We spoke with a specialist when he was two years old, but she wanted to wait at least a year for the surgery because the risks from anesthesia lessen in slightly older children. We returned to the specialist just after he turned four. Given that the surgery wasn't an emergency, we had to wait a few months for an appointment time to be available. On the day of the surgery my son was calm and happy. Being so young, he wasn't really aware what was about to happen. The surgery was also taking place in a children's hospital, so they had a lot of toys and other accommodations to make him feel comfortable. The surgery went quickly and smoothly, but waking up was difficult for my son. He was in a lot of pain and required three shots of morphine into his IV before he felt better. However, after that initial discomfort, the rest of the recovery went really well. He never needed pain medicine and was up waking around with his cast by that evening. After two weeks, he was able to have his cast removed. His foot was tender and sensitive without the support and protection of the cast, but after about three days he was able to walk normally again.

When my daughter was born, she was blue and hadn't pinkened up. The umbilical cord was around her neck, but it didn't tighten until she was coming through the birth canal. There had been no distress in the womb, and the heartbeat had been regular. We had to call an ambulance, which showed up within 10 minutes. They immediately put an oxygen mask on my daughter to help her breathe. My husband accompanied my daughter in the ambulance to the hospital. My doula had to help me deliver the placenta and help me get cleaned up, dressed, and headed to the hospital. When I got to the hospital, I was put in a wheelchair because I still felt very weak, and I was pushed up to the NICU where my daughter and husband were.

The buffet at the casino was having a menu special for the holiday, with a lot of Irish dishes such as shepherd's pie, corned beef and cabbage, and fish and chips. I had planned to take my parents to eat at the buffet since my dad's birthday was coming up. The plan was to go right when they open because it can get pretty busy during these special menu days. My father must have forgotten and had eaten a big breakfast in the morning so he declined to go, and my parents were out of the trip. Not wanting to waste the special menu day, I head over there to partake in the buffet special. The meal was delicious, from eggs benedict to prime rib and then fish and chips and I discovered I'm not a fan of corned beef. The meal was for free, as I was an elite member at the casino since I do gamble regularly. After I was done, I decided to head to the high limit area of the casino. I had won quiet a bit since the beginning of the year, and I had a pretty high bankroll. I start with around 1500 dollars and begin to play. I wasn't really looking to take any risk, but being full from the delicious feast, I decided to entertain myself and gamble a bit. It did not take long to lose all my money. Now I was on full tilt, frustrated with my enormous losses. Instead of walking out, I decided to make a withdraw of another 1500. Down another 500, I decide to try one more machine. After a few spins, I hit the bonus playing at 20 a spin. The bonus game is pretty unique with the multiplier of win line hits goes up after every free game. The thing that happened was when there was a 7x multiplier, I had a line hit for over 7000!! The bonus ended with almost winning 9500 which is my biggest jackpot every. I was very emotional, with shock and disbelief of what occurred. This was a gift, as it helped me pay down a lot of debt.

It's money that YOU made, so it doesn't matter. It's actually my money anyway\". I think that the most memorable (and chilling) thing about the entire incident was the \"flat affect\" that he gave off when he didn't think that anyone aside from me was looking (in regard to this situation).

The only other thing that I had to do, quite luckily, was, go through the rather Kafkaesque process of attempting to find a therapist.

He got into the seat next to me and say \"Hi, dad!\". I asked him how his day was and he told me with a smile that he really liked the school and his new classes and that his math teacher was really cool. he said he'd met some pretty nice kids and then asked if he could invite them over sometime next week to play video games after school. I was so happy! \"Of course you can!\" I said, \"just make sure you do your homework first.\" I said and he hugged me, then we drove off home.

The most surprising bit of the event was when she used ripped up tortillas to lure him into her room, but he just took them and ran back to the bed with them to eat. I kept getting up an consoling him when she was trying to get him out of bed, he really doesn't like doing things he doesn't want to do. Since I'm the pack leader of the house, he mostly comes to me when he's scared or not feeling well. My wife was in the room and she was laughing so hard it hurt her sides, that was the part that stood out the most. She's generally a funny person and laughs a lot but this really put her over the edge. I really love good memories with my family. It was a nice way to end the night, kinda like icing on the cake of a great day. I found out the next morning that she had gotten him into the room while I was sleeping.

The weather did turn out nice and we made our way hiking into the park. There were many interesting paths around the park and we got to see many amazing sites. The mountains, forests, streams and odd bit of wildlife all added to how awed we were by it all. We were having such a good time, instead of moving off toward other parks, we spent an extra day at the park. Once we had packed up our camping gear we went on with the rest of the trip. We left to do the other half of our trip plan, which was mostly driving and exploring. We drive around the state seeing all that we could see and remaining floored by the beauty. Unfortunately the weather turned to rain during this part of our trip, but we powered through. We wish that we could have had more time out there, but we had to come home.

Upon moving in the house, I knew the house had heat but no central ac unit. I expected there to be some minor issues with the heat during the summer but the house became to hot without no ac. To remedy the matter, I decided to buy two AC units for the house, one for upstairs and one for downstairs. The units worked fine all summer without no complications and cooled the house down perfectly. After some time, I noticed there was water leakage near the downstairs unit but did not think much of it. As I recall as well, the units seemed as though they were not exuding as much cool air as before as well. As a few weeks went by, the leak became worse and then the unit upstairs began to leak. Once I noticed the water by the second unit, I surmised the units were the cause but thought they were minor issues. After a week a so and the water began to increase, I decided I had to find a solution. I did not have the money to send both units in for repair so I decided to look up information if I could correct the issues myself. I researched the issue on YouTube on seen the instructions for properly cleaning the units to clear the blockage that causes the leakage. I decided to work on each unit one week at a time and cleaned out the debris that filled the units. I followed the instructions from the videos to the letter and once completed, the units were working as new.

Suddenly, I could feel him drifting left to right and not have full control of the car. This scared me instantly, and I shut down the music being in the passenger seat, and told him to focus on the road. But there was a cop behind us looking at what we were doing, and he pulled us to the side just to ask to make sure if we were drunk or not. Just experiencing that part really scared us because we knew we all weren't drunk, but the feeling of being pulled aside is a scary moment. We continued with our journey, and the entire trip was great. However, just that moment was the one thing that resided within our minds throughout the entire trip.

There's usually a long line to get to the window just to order but today we only had to wait about eight minutes. I got the combination plate of brisket and ribs. Mona got turkey breast as usual. They brought it out to us in less than ten minutes and we sat at a picnic table under the large pecan trees that surrounded the lot. I have to admit it was among the best Texas style brisket that I've ever had. I couldn't believe that my own son had turned his hobby of  competing in BBQ competitions all over Texas into an actual restaurant. And this place was fast becoming a recognized BBQ joint on the famed Texas BBQ trail. Texas Monthly had singled Brett's place out in the top 50 in the state and among the top 25 new places in the state. It was that good! I'm proud that Brett followed his passion and opened up his own place. He's getting a lot of recognition for his BBQ in terms of taste, quality, and innovation in the dishes he comes up with. It is definitely not the typical old style Texas BBQ. This is true craft BBQ on par with Aaron Franklin's place in Austin. He's competing on that level now.

She said he would do best in a home where he was the only pet. I opened his cage and held the lead to take him on a walk and he obliged.

For any of the doubts, it was being to solve it by myself. I felt very guilty to talk any one in this company. One day there was a biggest problem came to me which was created by my seniors, to check the eligibility of my working capacity of my knowledge. They were eagerly waiting me to get out of this company. At that time. I took a courage situation to overcome all the obstacles in that place. So I put my complete effort to win this challenge. I referred many of my college professors for theory doubts that helps me in many ways to win this challenge and finally I made it.

She would frequently criticize employees in the open, in front of others, engaged in verbally abusive behavior, and was very manipulative. At the end of March, I decided I'd had enough and decided to quit my job. I did not leave gracefully, and should have turned in two weeks notice; but I was very frustrated and angry and walked out of my job on a Friday afternoon. I spent two months looking for a new job. There were ups and downs, much hope for certain positions and much letdown when I was turned down for many positions. There was animosity between myself and my wife, as I was not contributing to our household income for two months, and we had to dip into our savings. I did get to bond somewhat with my 5-year-old son, because I was taking him to school and picking him up in the afternoons. I was somewhat depressed and feeling down on myself for acting impulsively and leaving my job abruptly and putting my family in that situation. I was also somewhat disappointed in my manager (supervisor's boss) at my previous job, because I had worked with her for nearly four years and had expressed frustration and concern with my supervisor's behavior. My disappointment was due to the fact that nothing was done to change the situation; and also that I never heard from her after I left. I emailed to explain the situation, tried calling and left voicemails, but heard nothing. I now have another job that is much less stressful. The benefits are similar and my take home pay is a bit less; but the difference in atmosphere is worth it to me. This has been a valuable learning experience for me. I will never again leave a job without having something else lined up. I also learned to treat work relationships like work relationships.

Autumn was gradually turning into winter, and we were looking for something fun to do, as a family. But this was a special occasion, because my mom was in town, and I hadn't seen her in 2 years. Her health had been poor as of late, but new physical therapy brought life back into her body movement and spirit. So, she was looking to visit and see her family. She flew in the day before, and brought love and excitement into the occasion. My kids, ever excited to see grandma, and find something fun to do, began listing all their ideas. Jack, my son, screamed, \"beach,' and Joan, my daughter, yelled, \"fair!\" We all agreed, based on weather, that the fair was the best idea, so, we packed up the car, and trekked out into town, where the fair was located. Typically, Im not too keen on fairs; its always so noisy, sometimes dirty, and for some reason I always get the cold/flu there. Nonetheless, my opinion was not important, because this was about family and magic, so we got our tickets at the booth, and began perusing all the attractions. The kids went on the Whirly Wheel first, and my wife tried the Cup Shooting (she won a giant penguin for my daughter). It was during this time that I was able to take a few minutes to chat with my mom face to face; it was nice to see her, see her up and moving. It was at this moment my mom told me she hadn't been on a carousel in 60 years, since she was a child. So we got on together, she sat on a pink horse, and I stood beside her for physical support. The music began and we began to whirl, the light in her eyes was palpable. It was life a flashback to her childhood; it was truly a magical moment. Afterwards, we joined together again, and went off the concession stand. The kids had never had fried dough, so we got three big plates full, and indulged. They filled their mouths as they listened to the sights and sounds around them.  \"This place is magical, Dad,\" Joan yelled. \"Ya! Im glad we didnt go to the beach!\" Fireworks erupted overhead.

We got to talking and figured out a ride-sharing schedule that allowed us to rotate who drove each other to and from the campuses. Like one person would drive this week and then another would drive next week and the next week I would drive, etc. That way no one person had to put the mileage on their car and we all chipped in for gas. I was so thankful that I met that group, because I was really having trouble making ends meet with how much gas I was using making those trips. It doesn't seem like much, but even a few bucks can make the difference for a college student. I like carpooling because we get to talk about a lot of things on the ride.

As we got closer, we realized it was some kids and a family having fun up on a hill further on the path. We shouted back to the kids, just playing with them; but their group saw us and told us to come join them along the trail. As we talked for a little, Dale and I discovered this group was headed to the sampe campsite as ours, so our journey continued with new friends. We shared stories about our life, dreams, and our love of nature. Bonding with these new people felt nice, especially in such a magical place. As the end of the day approached, we finally arrived at our campsite and set up or camp, as did our new friends. Dale and I started a fire after everything was ready, cooked some food, and played some music just taking in the day and preparing ourselves for the awesome week ahead of us in this great place.", "label": "imagined", "group": "1D59H7EA"}

I remember the day more vividly than anything else I can think of. We woke up early and she wasn't feeling well. She hadn't been feeling well for a while and we were concerned, though we knew that pregnancy was a possibility. By noon, she still felt like she had to throw up constantly, so we made the decision to get a pregnancy test. Since she didn't feel good, I went up to the Dollar Tree alone to get two pregnancy tests. It was a beautiful day outside so I took my time and enjoyed myself on the way there. I was nervous buying the pregnancy kits. I'm not sure why, because I'm an adult in my mid 30s, but it still made me feel like I was doing something I shouldn't be doing. I headed straight home with the pregnancy tests, where my wife was ready and waiting to take one. She took one of the boxes from me and ran into the bathroom. About a minute later, she emerged with a smile on her face and held up the test to show me the positive result. We both smiled and hugged eachother. We held eachother for a minute and then kissed. Even though we knew it was possible she was pregnant, this made it real.", "label": "recalled", "group": "7O7R2FRV"}

He made the mistake if waiting too long to start looking not ever thinking for a second he would have a hard time finding employment due to his experience and work history.  It was a lot harder than he thought due to his age.  Finally, when we had exhausted every last dime possible, a job came through. We were able to catch u[ on utility bills and we were about to start paying on outstanding debt when the unimaginable happened again.  He got laid off again!  This time around he was able to find another job but this one is so far away it is taking a toll on him mentally and physically.  I worry about him.

It has been a while since I had a computer, and since I didn't have one, it made no sense to have an internet connection. I had thousands of emails to catch up on and friends to \"friend\" on Facebook.  When I am depressed, I have no desire to see what friends are doing especially if something wonderful is happening in their lives like getting married. Knowing that marriage is so far for me, I can not relate. But if I were to be totally honest, I am jealous. Jealous that they, seemingly, have normal lives. Some days I can hardly get our of bed because of the depression. My boyfriend has been so patient with me. He is a great friend and is always there for me when I can't be there for myself. Surprisingly, we met at Barnes and Noble. About 6 months ago, I was in the self-help section and he was looking for a book for his graduate studies in psychology. I did not notice him at first but smelled cigarettes and followed my nose to a thin man with a beard. I gave him on of those once overs, starting at the flash of red hair (oh how I love gingers). The beard was slightly more brown than his hair and his eyes were bright blue wearing tortoise shell Raybans. Moving down I noticed he was quite muscular despite his smallish stature. I stand 5 feet on a good day and he was a few feet taller. Wearing a white V-neck and perfectly fitted Levis, he somehow intrigued me. I moved a little closer to see if I could detect, through the cigarette smell, the cologne he was wearing. Yep, there is was, Aqua de Gio. My favorite and one that totally turns me on. I am getting slightly turned on now as I am writing this. What surprised me most was when he noticed me and asked me how my day was going. I blushed a little and said \"Great, now\". He asked me to have coffee with him in the Starbucks at the book store and as they say...\"the rest is history\".", "label": "imagined", "group": "TJYYK121"}

I was still optimistic about selling, but I was getting a little worried. Eventually, foreclosure procedures were started on the property.  I also had to pay utilities and other various taxes and bills.  It was a drain on my money, and reached the point where I was going to be losing money on the sale.  I was still willing to do it, because I wanted to avoid foreclosure. I finally got an offer on the house.  It was just enough that I would be able to afford the payoff I had gotten the month before.  I had to request a new payoff, and came to find that it had jumped $5000 since the last time, because of lawyers fees and escrow advancement. Because of this, at just the moment someone put in a good offer on the house, and I'd be able to sell and avoid foreclosure, the payoff amount jumped far beyond my means.  This left me with no other option than to wait for a foreclosure, and take the hit to my credit. I was greatly disappointed and annoyed, because I'd spent thousands of dollars trying to make the house ready for sale, and was willing to spend thousands more to sell it at a loss, but it all came crashing down because of the worst possible timing.", "label": "recalled", "group": "LLO6GWHJ"}

We are living our dream and cannot be happier.  We are still saving money as we want to purchase our own land and build a house within the next year or so.

As I was cutting the felling cut strong gust of wind came up and blew directly opposite where I wanted the tree to land. I then heard some cracking and so I ran 45\u00b0 away from the tree. And much to my horror the tree went backwards. this resulted in the tree getting hung up and some other trees which is an even more dangerous situation. I picked myself up off the ground and looked at the situation which was not what I had been expecting. It was frightening but the realization didn't really hit me until the adrenaline had gone down a bit. I know the chopping down trees is dangerous but it can be relatively safe as long as you follow a few rules. I learned that you definitely need to follow those rules that day.", "label": "retold", "group": "QAZNCDNO"}

He was such a force on this earth, everyone that knew him, had a funny story to tell about him.  He was loved by so many people in the small town I grew up in and anytime anyone found out he was my uncle they would beam a huge smile and tell me about their time spent while he was alive.  Several months ago, I came across an old Facebook post of a cousin on my mother's side of the family.  She had mentioned being at the bar my uncle was in with his friends on the night of his death.  He was thrown from the passenger sent out of the front dash because he wasn't wearing a seat belt.  His friend was obviously too drunk to be driving, but survived because he did have his seat belt on.  In my cousin's post, as I said before, she mentioned that she was there and that as he and his friend were leaving, she thought to herself, that it was a bad idea for them to be on the road and maybe someone should call cab.  This post is so frustrating for me.  I want so badly to have met this man.  My oldest son looks exactly like him and, oh, the pain when someone see him and says so.  I always hear, \"Your uncle would have just been so tickled with him (my son).\"  Yes, I believe he would be and would have been with me, too, as a child growing up.  I feel robbed of his presence in my life, even though I understand that he made the decisions that lead to his death.  Now with the added insult of knowing another family member was there and didn't make a effort help adds even more sickening feelings into my already overflowing pot of emotions.  Unfortunately, my cousin is now also deceased for nearly a year and I am angry and frustrated at the fact I can't pick her brain about that night or find any closure on my anger with her for not helping because she's dead, too.", "label": "retold", "group": "N5DCCA0D"}

This event was almost two months ago to the day when I went back to Michigan for my friends wedding and it changed the way I saw our relationship. To give some context we have had some tough times and ups/downs as friends and kind of lost the original closeness we had which was sad. There were some times where we had this big fights and our relationship had changed. When I went back for the wedding we spend a lot of time together and it felt like old times again. At one point he called me his best friend when we were in a group and I almost wanted to get teary because I had not heard him say something like that in a handful of years. It was really meaningful for me as an individual and I also think for us as a couple of friends as stupid as it sounds. One night we stayed up until about four am just sitting outside looking at the stars and telling dumb stories of things we used to do when we were younger. While we can never go back to that time exactly, it was really great feeling good again and knowing that we were friends without having to feel uncomfortable like we sometimes used to. We played ping pong and jammed on instruments, to be honest we also had some drinks while we were doing all of this! If we would have had more time we probably would have watched a movie but the guy had a wedding the next day! And then the day of the wedding it was just so great to see him happy and married. It was like everything bad that happened before didn't matter and we could go back to being best friends. Nothing else mattered, all of the fights and stupid things we got mad about.  I will never forget my best friends wedding, I am glad I made it back. We would do anything for each other and it was a great reminder of that very fact.", "label": "recalled", "group": "MHMZ9B9G"}

I was just suffering through these contractions at home, while my husband slept to get some rest. I waiting until my contractions were closer in intervals. When it start getting to about 4 minutes between each contraction, I told my husband that we needed to go to the hospital. So, we got a taxi and was at the hospital. I wanted to get the epidural to relieve my pain, but the nurse told me that my cervix was already 8 cm dilated, so since it was so close for me to push, she couldn't let me have the pain reliever. Now, I remember being in the room, I changed and laid down. Once, the doctor got there, it was time for me to push. In all of this pain, I tried my best to breathe through it. Active labor wasn't long, but it was so painful. The doctor even had to cut me, to get my baby out.

I got all packed up and ready to go on the camping trip with them and their friends, make 12 of us altogether. We met up at the camping park they picked out. Some of their other friends were already there, getting their tents ready. I found Angela and Jesus and saw they already had their tent up. I decided to put my tent near their tent. We helped other people as they arrived put up their tents. We didn't really do much that day as it started to get dark as the last tent was put up. We all worked together to get a fire going. Some people gathered sticks and small brush. Others got larger pieces of wood. I helped get a spot ready for the pit. I helped gather large rocks. We ended up making a large pit, as there were twelve of us altogether there, and we all wanted to be able to sit around the fire. We didn't make the fire that big that night as it was just more for enjoying the camping atmosphere, but the pit we made could easily be used for a bon fire. The next day we took a raft and went on the river. The raft was huge, and easily floated all of us down the river. It was fun, until the sky started to get dark. We got off the river and started heading back to the camp site. Sure enough a rain storm had moved in as we were on the river, and it started raining like crazy as we were walking back to the camp site. We all got soaked, but luckily by the time we got back to the camp site the rain stopped. We got a really big fire going that evening and had a lot of fun bonding over the fire and telling ghost stories. It was fun, even with the rain, and I wouldn't mind going on a camping trip with them again sometime.", "label": "imagined", "group": "TFESB7B8"}

We've been playing together for a few years now and have played a number of gigs in and around our home city, but this was a big opportunity for us.

We got to play in front of a few hundred people, and people really seemed to enjoy the music that we were playing! Though some of the people moved to and fro throughout the festival, there were a good portion that stayed to watch our set. We played for about 40 minutes in total, for a set that included 6 original songs and 1 cover. The cover was a song by the Grateful Dead, which is one of our favorite bands. We chose that song because it always goes over well when we play it live. The most surprising part of the story is that we even had the opportunity to play at all. We didn't know about the music festival until after the deadline to apply, but we sent an earnest email to the festival organizers asking them to consider our late submission. They must have responded well to the sample and the email that we sent them because they agreed! It was such an amazing opportunity. Even though we played in one of the earliest time slots, there were still loads of people enjoying the activities and it was a very meaningful experience for us. Playing and performing music is one of my life passions, and even though it isn't my career, it's still nice to be recognized for the hard work and to be given an opportunity to showcase that work in front of local fans.

I had to wear them despite my reservations and prepared my apologies for when I got there.  I knew the name of the hotel and gave them to the cab driver when I got in.

Since he was diagnosed, his condition has progressively gotten worse over time: he has difficulty controlling his bowels, suffers from poor energy levels, has difficulty keeping food down, etc.. He has gone to numerous doctors and has had several procedures performed, but his health has continued to decline. Still, he managed to remain mostly independent until sometime this year. Approximately 2 months ago, he had his first incident which required a 2-3 week stay at the hospital. He fell ill while at home and 911 was called to bring him to a local hospital. When I found out about the incident, I was basically forced to pick up responsibilities around my parent's home. This included picking up and helping drive my mother to and from the hospital on a daily basis so that she could see my father. It also included having to handle grocery shopping and basic household chores, such as doing the laundry, taking out the trash, and general housekeeping since my mother was frequently at my father's bedside in the hospital. All these sudden and additional tasks were a heavy burden on me because I had to juggle them in addition to my own normal everyday tasks. The incident also added an emotional burden because I now had to worry about my father's physical well-being while at work. I couldn't plan too far ahead in advance because I knew I had to be on call and be available whenever my parents needed my help. I was no longer taking care of my own affairs and I had to refocus my energies on helping my parents get through their difficulties before I could attend to my own. Since then, my father's condition hasn't really improved. Although he has returned home, I'm still on call at all hours in case he has another incident.

Now I really want to do as much as I can to help people, either similar to me or just not in a good spot, like I am for now. This also let me know that I might not always be in good spot, and that there are people out there who could and want to help me. Besides the important thing of helping people who needed it, the whole garden part about it was really nice as well. Now that I know more about that, and how it can bring people together, I am really intrigued by it. Its something that is a process, but at the same time it is also peaceful. I think that is a hobby when it comes to gardening that is something I am going to look into. It made those people happy, and it did me as well.  This was something that I am just glad I got to experience with people who really ended up making me happy in the end as well.

Because my friend lives on that same lake and I get down there to visit on a regular basis, it's  as if things have come full circle for him. I remember watching his dad teaching him to swim and ice skate, both at very early ages. I can see my friend already indicating as well as making mention that he plans to follow in those same footsteps with his son. It gives me great satisfaction as well as pleasure. However it definitely makes me wish that I had children of my own. Fortunately I have MANY nieces and nephews that I am able to interact with on a regular basis. It's very rewarding and satisfying to watch each of them grow up and grow into each of their own skins. Because almost all of their parents are raising their children \"old school\", the kids are well behaved and we'll mannered which unfortunately seems to be the exception to the rule these days. Not sure why so many parents these days allow their children to make their decisions for them, yet alone speak to them in the manner in which they allow them to speak to them. It seems like they want to be their children's friends rather than their parents. That only works after the children have become adults. You must be enforce rules and consequences as their role models. Without them, children will lack the direction they require. Consistency is also key in child's life as they grow up. Fortunately I was raised by both my Mom and Grandparents so I received the proper upbringing necessary to become a respectful member of society. It is unfortunate that so many children I observe as they grow up, obviously haven't received the proper foundation they need. This leads many times to the inappropriate behavior displayed by these same children. If our society continues to progress in this direction, I believe that our society will suffer.

I missed the comfort of a bed and TV so I rented a motel room. That was a big mistake. I didn't think about how much that would cut into my funds. After only a few days in the motel room I had run out of money. I was determined though. I did NOT want to go back to my boring 9 to 5 job and monotonous lifestyle. I kept trying to live this lifestyle because it felt so good to me. While continuing my adventure I found a parking lot that I could stay in because it was never really full. Having no money made it hard though, I really couldnt keep up the adventurous lifestyle of pleasure I was seeking the way I wanted to anymore But I wasn't going to give up. That is until the worst case scenario happened. A few days after moving into that parking lot I heard a knock on my window. Two police officers were outside and they looked mad. They asked me what I was doing and I confidently explained that I left home to pursue a life of personal pleasure and to get away from it all. They weren't hearing it though and a couple minutes later I was asked to step out of the car where they cuffed me and took me to jail.

The moment that I had been waiting for was finally here. The girls were greeted with a roaring \"SURPIRSE!\" as soon as the door opened. I was standing there, sweating more than I think I ever have! I'm not sure exactly what I said to her, I know I fumbled and stuttered through an \"I love you more than anything else,\" and I might have even shed a tear. All I know is that when that moment came, I got down on one knee and finally asked the question that I have wanted to ask since I laid eyes on her, \"Will you marry me, Alana Moser?\" Tears filled her eyes and she jumped eagerly into my open embrace, and tearfully accepted my proposal. It was the perfect place, time and occasion to take the leap with her! She is finally my fiance, and I couldn't be happier!", "label": "imagined", "group": "2HQPU67Q"}

It was finally a nice clear day out and we both had off from work.  We were catching up on what's been happening in our lives, and a deer shot across the trail.  It was very beautiful.  I'm used to seeing chipmunks and squirrels, but I didn't think I would see any deer.  As we were a couple miles in, we crossed a bridge.  I don't think I am afraid of heights, but what happened really changed my mind.  As I was going over the bridge, I looked down and the distance was so great. It really freaked me out.  Right behind me, another biker passed me, as I was trying to be extra cautious.  It was so scary.  The bridge reminded me of the bridges you see in fun houses that are shaky.  Seeing my friend on the other side of the bridge helped a lot.  She gave me confidence and encouraged me.  I am glad she was with me.  I don't think I would have crossed the bridge if she wasn't.", "label": "imagined", "group": "L8US8H51"}

I was good, I ate at the cafe that has salads and such. I had one of his french fried with ketchup and I couldn't believe how intense the saltiness was. I haven't had a lot of salt in the past few weeks so it was intense salt taste. I wanted to give him something really special and personal for Christmas (I believe it was our second or third Christmas together). I reflected back on gifts that my loved ones had given me through the years and decided that my absolute favorite gift was the photo album of my life that my parents put together for me. Given that my husband's parents had died several years before we met, I thought it would be the perfect way for me to get to know him and a beautiful memento of his life that he would cherish forever. I spent hours after work secretly rifling through a box of photos I found, gathering the best shots of him, his family, his homes and his beloved dogs. I hoped he wouldn't see any part of my project before it was over since I wanted him to be totally surprised. I took pride and delight in my project. My heart overflowed with love and I could hardly wait for Christmas morning when he would open it and laugh, cry, and appreciate me all the more.", "label": "imagined", "group": "Z6VV28X7"}

I had previously struggled to find an affordable place to live while I am in the process of saving money to pay off debts. I had just moved the previous year into a new home with a close friend, and having a roommate was saving me roughly $100/mo versus my expenses living alone in the smaller apartment I moved from. Unfortunately, after only living together a few months, my roommate, who was only 19 at the time, decided he wasn't ready to live on his own, and opted to move back in with his parents. His parents took him back without any problems, but this left me in the unfortunate position of not having the money to cover all of the expenses associated with moving, but also not earning enough every month to cover my expenses living in the 2-bedroom apartment alone. At first, I struggled to find a new roommate, but I was living in a rural location that was not very enticing to any of my similarly-aged single friends, who seek to live in an urban environment with nightlife. I then negotiated with my landlord for slightly cheaper rent in exchange for maintaining the property for him. I did things like mowing the grass and cleaning the other units in preparation for new tenants, and he took $100/mo off of my rent. This helped, but it didn't leave me any free time because I was constantly working or doing side jobs to earn extra income, taking care of the large property by myself, or cleaning my own large apartment. However, just a few months ago, a good friend of mine told me that he had a small house which he had been renting, but he was now preparing to sell. He thought it would be beneficial for me to have a cheap place to live, and it would be beneficial to him if he could sell the home to someone who would maintain it as a rental property. He allowed me to move in at a rental rate that was $200/mo cheaper than my current rate including my $100/mo discount. In addition, he waived the security deposit so that I could move in immediately. When he sold the home, I locked in my low rent with the new owner indefinitely with a year-to-year lease that automatically renews. I also pay less for utilities such as electricity because the home is smaller, and the internet providers here are cheaper than they were in my old apartment. Overall this has left hundreds more dollars in my pocket every month which I am now being able to use to dig myself out of debt faster.", "label": "recalled", "group": "LCC613Y3"}

They showed us how to put the lease on the dog and walk the dog properly and to keep them from getting in fights or into some type of trouble. The next day was my first day of volunteering. I took my first dog out for a spin. If I remember it was a lab/pitbull named Daisy. Daisy was quite a handful but we walked from the Humane Society to the nearby park  and around the park and then back to the Humane Society. I still had some time left with Daisy so I took her out into the yard behind the main society and toss the ball around to her. After that I took her to her cage and then spent some time with all of the cats that they have there. I also stopped by and visited with a couple of rabbits and the hamster. That was my first day at the Humane Society. I enjoyed myself and I will definitely go back there again. While I have the most fun with the dogs, I do spend time with the cats as well because they need human visitors too.

While there was no one to do this work, I took it upon myself to do the weeks and weeks of hard work for no pay.   I think that doing good works for people without really asking for anything in return us honorable.  My cousin told me that he got a price quote for 1,000 dollars to do all the work.  My cousin had been sick a long time and inherited his father's house when he died.  My cousin has inherited a lot of wealth, but is in bad health himself, which is not a good thing.  In my opinion, money cannot buy mental health or sanity.  Moreover, it can be more of a burden, inheriting thousands and thousands of dollars. I spent so many weekends in the heat of the summer, doing laborious yard work over six weekends, that I lost 5 pounds. I spent my 15 minutes breaks, drinking Powerade and water during the eighth or nine hours per day that I cut down all the overgrown hedges and weeds around my Uncle's house. I also trimmed around the shed and elsewhere on my Uncle's property.  It was all work and no play at my Uncle's old house.  I did like the views in their town.  The sky was open and there were plenty of views of the mountains.  I guess that was an upside to doing the work.  You did get the fresh air of the mountains. Over the six weekends that I was tidying up the yard out front and around back, the neighbors were pleasantly surprised that work was getting done.  The one neighbor of my Uncle was on his riding tractor, cutting his lawn like everyone in my Uncle's small town tend to do.  In fact, they were watching as I took some time, cutting all the large branches and large plants that were growing near the edge of the neighbor's property.  The neighbors in town don't miss a thing.  It is a town with very little crime from the statistics that I checked out.  My Uncle's town was very safe, since everyone knows each other's name. These weeds had been overgrown for a decade, but it got the neighbor's attention -- in a good way.

Nowadays, you can actually reserve seats and order food; you can get there 30 seconds before the movie starts, have your seats and have your food delivered to you. It cost almost $75 for the three of us, but it was worth it for him to have a fun day out. He really enjoyed seeing the movie with us, and had a blast seeing all the characters. In addition to the movie, I decided to have a surprise for him. He's been saying he wanted a buzz lightyear for himself, so I ordered one off amazon and hid it in the car. When we got into the movie, my wife told him someone wanted to see the movie with him. His eyes really lit up when she took the buzz out. He held him and sat with him through the whole movie. I think I even, at one point, saw him talking to buzz, telling him something about the movie. It was really one of my favorite moments. We have a younger daughter who wouldn't do well at the movies yet, but it really makes me think about how much fun the two of them will be together.

My husband and I went with my brother, sister-in-law, their nineteen month old, and our two kids, who are 15 months and 3. It was QUITE an experience. We stayed in a lovely rental house in Rosemary Beach, about an hour from Destin. The drive was not too bad, about five hours from our home, but it was long enough with small children in the car. I was nervous about this trip because it was our first family vacation and I have a hard time managing my two strong-willed children, especially when they are together. Sure enough, by Day 2 I was exhausted. I had to carry my youngest on my hip probably ninety percent of the time, even including when we were at home. He woke up at 5:30 AM every morning, so I was forced to do so as well. We engaged in a variety of activities including souvenir shopping, visiting the community pool, going to the beach, and watching a bottlenose dolphin show at an aquarium. Probably my favorite thing we did was go to a natural spring that wasn't far from where we were staying. The water was a beautiful aquamarine and clear as it could be. The only problem was it was COLD! We had a blast wading and swimming a bit, and just enjoying the beautiful scenery. Although it was hard to keep both kids organized and happy, it was a memorable experience and one that I'll not soon forget. It was wonderful to have time to spend with them and also with my brother and his family. They are very dear to us.", "label": "recalled", "group": "5DH5J1U5"}

I had even picked out a ring for her and had even planned to ask her to marry me this weekend in front of her family. Everything I knew about love and loyalty vanished in front of my eyes as soon as I heard the other voice on the end of the phone tell me this was her fiance.

He set the hook, then passed the rod of to me. Then, another rod bent all the way down. Another fish was on! The guide grabbed that pole and handed it to my dad. I was busy fighting the tarpon, and he was fighting his. After about 10 minutes, the tarpon on my line jumped in the air and snapped the line. I was disappointed, but still excited because I had a lot of fun fighting the fish. I looked over at my dad, and he was still fighting his fish.

As I walked up the steps to the therapists office I was deep in thought. Was this the right choice? I was so nervous. I slowly began to climb the stairs. On the third step my deep concentration on the talk to come distracted me from my climb and I fell backward down the stairs and hit my head. Pain burst through my scalp and my head immediately began throbbing. I reached to the back of my head and felt wetness. I yelled for help. The therapist came running out of her office and called 911. I was rushed to the emergency room and diagnosed with a minor concussion and got 3 stitches for the cut in my head. So much for my first therapy visit. After a week of rest and recovery I once again returned to my therapists office and this time I carefully used the railing as I climbed the stairs. Today I safely made it in to the office for my first official appointment. The first appointment went ok. I was a little nervous but the therapist was kind and I decided to come back twice a week at her suggestion. Since that day I have been seeing her twice a week and I have been able to share many difficult feelings. The more I see her the more I trust her and the more I am able to share about my experiences. Sometimes details that I have not thought about in many years come to me between visits so it is very useful to be able to return later in the week to discuss again.

My second theory turns out to be true, as he repeatedly turns in his seat to talk to me, succeeding in his attempts at insipid small talk while I give terse, disinterested answers. I live in the vain hope that my body language and preoccupation with my phone will eventually discourage him. I go to take a bite out of my breakfast sandwich and he turns around again, offering to buy me breakfast as he watches me chew. I stare at him, befuddled, finish chewing, swallow, and tell him no thank you before turning my attention to my phone, typing pointedly. He turns back, then minutes later turns back to me, and starts telling me a story about buying bread the other day. I have had it. I tell him I'm really not trying to be rude, but I'm just trying to eat my breakfast and take care of some work stuff. I wasn't in the mood to talk to anyone, sorry. He recoils, looks offended, and he repeatedly turns in his seat, then back at me petulantly, ranting about how he was just trying to be nice, he was just talking to me, I can't even be decent enough to talk to him? Because apparently I owe him conversation. I explain to him that I don't really care and to leave me alone. I can see a couple employees of the restaurant had sat down at one point, on break and/or checking in to see what was going on. I can see them watching quietly, trying to see if this escalates to the point where they need to intercede...again.

That's right, this is the second time in the last six months or so that I've gotten into an argument with a man who wouldn't leave me alone when I told him to. Apparently, he's had his fill, because he scrambles out of the booth, grabs his backpack, and starts retreating to the exit across the building. Again, he turns to walk away, stops, turns back to me, turns to walk away, turns back, rinse, repeat.

He seemed to be in no pain, but he could,nt get up. We brought him some water and he drank some. After calling tyhe vet, we had to put him into the car. That was very dfficult, because he could not move and he was heavy (105 lbs). We manged to put him in the car with a blanket and we drove to the vet. With some help, we took him inside. The vet checked him and looked troubled. He hardly had bloodpressure. He is in a shock. There wasa a possibility , to find out, what happened top him,but that was very expensive. ($4000),and the chance , there was nothing serious wrong was zero. So we decided to let him sleep. The vet gave him the shot, and we said goodbeye to him. We all cried. It was so hard. We still miss him. Now this statement below tells me , I have only typed 8 sentences. But when I count, there are more than 20. Hoiw is this possible? In the meantime, I typed 4 more and still have only 8.What do I have to do to make 15 sentences? One more. One more. Two more? Three more./Four more? Five more. Six more.

Coming off of fall break, I was struggling to find money for a train ticket. Luckily the dilemma was short lived. Because of my supporting family and friends they came up with a way to help me. With the support of family and close friends, they helped out tremendously. I was able to get back to school to finish out my spring semester with great grades. The lessons learned is saving money and looking into fares ahead of time as they are cheaper. People will pay a premium for train tickets if they purchase them late. Another lesson learned is to always have a strong support system. In addition to having a strong support system, it reminds me to never forget those whom helped me. Paying it forward is an important part of my journey in life. Keeping in mind a philosophy of interdependence, we all owe one another.

But the gas got everywhere! I got it all over my hands and my pants. I should have known to clean it up too after I reattached the line but I wasn't thinking and just started the cart back up. IT CAUGHT FIRE. It was so awful! I had to jump out of the cart so I didn't catch fire and run for the fire extinguisher. I managed to get it out okay and nothing on the track got damaged but my cart was ruined. My gas line was warped and important parts of the motor were completely melted. I think the owner of the track felt really bad for me because he agreed to store the cart until I decided what I wanted to do with it, try and repair it or just scrap it for parts. A new cart is so expensive though. I still don't know the answer to that one. But then I was kind of stuck. I didn't have my phone on me so I couldn't call someone for a ride and I certainly didn't have a go-cart to ride back home in. So I had to walk. I didn't even realize how far away the track was until I just had to huff it on foot. It's far! Like, at least five miles. It took me a whole hour to get home and I was exhausted.

I had worked as a server in a nice family restaurant for thirteen years, after owning my own business for twenty years and retiring to go RVing.  I never thought of my serving job as really hard work, because I enjoyed the people I worked with, enjoyed the customers, was proud of the product I sold, and in general had a good time working about 25 hours per week. I retired for the second time because I am just too darned old to carry heavy trays and do my share of the cleaning and side work which each employee is expected to finish each day as part of their job. I was really touched and surprised when, on my last day of work all my coworkers gave me a small party, with gifts and cake.  My manager gave me a gift certificate for Whole Foods, and another supervisor bought me a B-B gun to scare rabbits out of my garden.  About two years before retiring I bought some land outside of town and decided to try some sustainable farming techniques and permaculture experiments.  I sold my RV and put a small home om the land.  I planned to build a greenhouse right after retirement, but I got sick and could not really do anything on my farm for two months.  I was really depressed and was about to give up.  Then one morning I got a phone call from a co-worker and friend, asking if I was going to be home that day. About an hour after the call, I looked out my front window to see a caravan of pickups and cars coming down my road.  I walked out the door to see over half my co-workers unloading building suppiles from their trucks, and picnnic supplies with a barbeque grill from various SUVs and cars.  Over the next three days every single worker in the restaurant spent hours in their off time to build me a beautiful greenhouse, a carport and a fenced in area for a garden. I never knew that friends like this existed.  I hope I have helped out when needed.  I hope I have done my share to assist my co-workers when they needed help.  But I never expected the support and help I got from these wonderful friends, and hope I can someday pay it forward.", "label": "recalled", "group": "QQ44V919"}

I was not expecting it at all and I was so honored to be given this award. Afterwards I found out that a lot of people had known I was going to get this award and had actually nominated me for it. I work extremely hard to get people excited and want to be involved in serving their communities and to be a light in the world. I don't do the work I do for the recognition or awards, but sometimes it is nice to know that others see the effort and time that you put into something and to know that you are making a difference in the world.

I had briefly looked up, and saw something that at the time, didn't mean much to me. A woman had walked into my room, a dead look in her eyes as she started at me, before turning around and walking out. I had assumed it was somebody looking for the bathroom, but they didn't ask for instructions, instead me assuming they were just shocked at walking into a bedroom. I brushed it off, and continued with what I was doing, until I heard a shriek come from the living room. \"Who are you!?\" I heard my mother shout. I got up and ran to the front room, to see what was going on. I arrived just in time to see some of the guests escorting the mystery woman out of the house. It turned out that this wasn't somebody invited to the party at all, instead being some random drug addict. The people who walked the woman out told us that as she was leaving she said that she \"saw a party, and wanted to have fun too.\" Thankfully, she understood the hint, and didn't come back that night, but it's still something that I'll never forget.", "label": "imagined", "group": "IQFHNBMB"}

I finished doing all of that and watched them all chow down on some good quality kibble that someone had donated the day before. I was told that they don't receive a lot of high quality food donations, so this was really helpful. There are so many dogs here that it takes a large bag of kibble a day just to keep them fed. After feeding them all, it was time to start bathing the new pets that were brought to us this morning. I'm most comfortable washing small dogs, so I washed the 2 pomeranians that were brought in and left the Rottweiler to someone more experienced than me. I loved both of the little fluff balls, but the white one (a girl) was not happy with her bath at all. She was nervous and whining the entire time, while the brown one (a boy) was a champ about the whole thing. I bathed the white one first so she could get out and get dried off I was able to use a blow dryer on her, so she got dry pretty quickly. The boy pom was a lot easier to deal with, so it didn't take me long to bathe him off. They were both infested with fleas, the poor things. I get upset when I see animals mistreated like this. There's no excuse to be eaten up with fleas like that at all. All it takes is a regular bath to keep them mostly off and I don't understand why people can't do that like they're supposed to.

It had been an easy pregnancy, like my first, and there was no reason to think anything could be wrong. I'd had great prenatal care all the way through the pregnancy and totally trusted my doctors. So when I finally went into labor, I knew I'd be in good hands, and my main concern was meeting our baby daughter (and having the pain of labor and delivery be finished.)  My husband Joe took me to the hospital when the contractions indicated that they really meant business this time. We got there quickly, and within minutes, I was in a very comfortable, well-appointed labor-and-delivery room. My doctor soon showed up and hooked me up to the fetal monitor, which showed things like our little girl's heart rate.   The first sign anything was awry was evidenced by my sweet-natured doctor's expression.  She explained to us that our little girl was showing signs of distress, with a raised heartbeat and other signs.  This meant it was crucially important to deliver our baby quickly, which might necessitate a Caesarean.   However, the labor was progressing along quite quickly, so it was very possible the C-section could be averted.  The doctor and attending nurse monitored me closely, and as soon as I was fully dilated, which happened quickly, I was instructed to push as hard as I possibly could.  After several extremely intense and painful contractions and gut-ripping pushes, our little sweet one, to be named Carla, was out.  But something was very wrong.  While newborns are generally bluish when they are born, Carla was a deep purplish.  After letting us give her a too-brief cuddle, the doctors (now there was another) whisked her away for examination and further testing.  Joe and I were very worried we'd lose her, but the doctors reassured us that we were in the right place, and she would probably be fine. They had dealt with births like this before, they assured us, but we were terrified of losing her.... or something else going wrong...  About 45 minutes later, our doctor stepped back into the room.  Joe and I anxiously waited to hear the news, which was better, but definitely not perfect. Carla, the doctor explained, had been born with a small hole in her heart which caused a heart murmur, an irregular sounding beat.  It would need to be tracked and monitored, and possibly might be treatable when she got older, but for now, we would just watch and wait, and she would be fine.  A little later, our beloved newborn was wheeled back into the room, with a much healthier color.", "label": "imagined", "group": "URJ7JXSG"}

My son walked along my side during my illness and knew that reaching a point where I could travel with him would be the best reward I could hope for.

Animal Kingdom was by far our favorite resort with Epcot a close second. My son had been very careful to book all of our dining reservations with my needs in mind. A chef came to our table to ask me about my dietary restrictions and made beautiful meals for me. We even had a refrigerator and microwave in our room so I could prepare my own breakfast each day. We both agreed that Disneyland still outshines any theme park and will be our family favorite.

I just can't sit on these memories without reliving them again. I look forward to the day when I will see and feed my beloved giraffes. The good thing is that my boyfriend is an outgoing person. He loves to go to watch animals, and I think he just got himself a good companion. Come this weekend, I will be the first one to propose going to watch animals. I intend to carry goodies to my hosts.

Our other dog is a terrier mix around 30 pounds, Sadie, and she has a seizure disorder. They both recently just turned three and have spent the majority of their lives together. We adopted Sadie at three months, and Roxy at six months. Sadie developed a seizure disorder and would have seizures at night about once a month, and they are cluster seizures so they happen a few times within a 24-hour period. Roxy usually sleeps in her kennel downstairs at night so she hasn't been around the seizures. Starting six months ago, Sadie's seizures have progressed and happen every two weeks now and during the day as well. Starting six months ago, Roxy would attack Sadie during her seizures. We thought at first she was trying to help, but then it got worse. Last Friday night, everything seemed fine and it was gorgeous weather outside so we took the dogs for a walk. Roxy attacked Sadie in the woods behind our house even though Sadie was not having a seizure. Sadie is doing okay, we took her to the vet on Monday when they opened and she got some shots and cleaned up. We don't know what to do with Roxy though. Most likely we will have to put her down. I'm so upset and disturbed, this is one of the most difficult things I've ever done. I love them both to pieces. I wish I could re-home Roxy but we don't know anyone who can take her and our vet said she will probably be put down at a shelter. It's just an ugly and very unpleasant situation. We started Roxy on an antidepressant on Monday to help take the edge off of her aggression but then we will be boarding her for 14 days at a training facility.

This has been challenging for us both from a financial standpoint, as he is on workers comp instead of receiving his full pay for working, including his usual overtime hours, and from an emotional standpoint. It is difficult for him to sit idly at home most of the day rather than being productive in his physically demanding job. He is becoming very restless but is limited in his ability to even complete projects around the house during this time off from work due to the nature of the injury. He does attend physical therapy three times a week which gives him an outlet outside the house but progress is slow and on days after physical therapy, he's more exhausted and the pain flares a bit more so he's resigned to the couch for most of the day afterwards and can't even do many minor chores around the house. They told us it should be getting easier by now, but it's just not and that's hard to deal with. I don't know how many more months of this we can take. It's hard for me to shoulder the burden of the majority of the household tasks as he is physically unable right now. The other challenge is financial. We had become accustomed to the extra income from his overtime hours, and while I'm thankful for worker's compensation to help cover most of the missing income, it doesn't help with the income above and beyond his base rate. We had been making progress in building up our emergency savings and having some extra disposable income. Now without the overtime hours, the savings progress has come to a screeching halt. It's frustrating to say the least. I have no ability work overtime hours at my job so we're fairly stuck income wise for the time being. I really hope his injury starts healing faster and that he's able to go back to work in some capacity very soon because this is draining and stressful for everyone in our household right now.", "label": "imagined", "group": "W3U6VVXD"}

Thankfully, nobody was hurt and the bad guys were arrested. The whole ordeal was over in less than 10-minutes. It was probably the most frightening 10-minutes I have ever experienced.

We were on the road for about 5 hours when the car we were in experienced a flat tire.

We tried calling the rental car company and tried calling for help but there was no connection. My friends and I decided to walk back about 4 miles to where we saw a gas station to call for help. About an hour later we were at the gas station but there was no one there, and we still had no phone service. We decided to stay at the gas station for some time hoping that someone would show up. 4 hours later with no service and still waiting for help we decided to walk back to the car. 30 minutes after walking towards the car we saw a huge van start to head towards us, we jumped up and down for help and the van stopped and a musician who was playing at the same venue we were going to got out the van with his security. My friends and I explained the situation and they gave us a ride to the venue and backstage passes it was amazing. Before we got to the venue we were able to call the rental car company and they tracked the car to pick it up and return it to us.

So we decided to pack up our stuff in our car and a u-haul and drive back to the Pacific Northwest since both of our families are here and they were sort of asking us to come back. I remember very vividly our drive back across the country. I had this moment where I just felt free, like a huge weight had been lifted off both of us. Her grandmother was really nice and helped us so much when we were young and lost in life, to be fully clear. However, after nearly a decade of taking care of her it was a huge relief to just be free to worry about ourselves and focus on our lives and our relationship fully. That trip was maybe the best 2 weeks of my life. We took our time and saw the sights from coast to coast but the best part was definitely our time spent at the grand canyon. I always thought something like that was neat but pretty boring but seeing it for myself at that specific time in my life with the woman I love is something I'll never forget. We made it safely back home and now we're busy starting our lives with our families near us. I'd say we're in the best spot we've ever been in as far as our relationship is concerned.

The park is a big hill, so all paths into the park go upwards, but they generally aren\u2019t too steep. Once you get to the top of the park, it becomes a long flat path popular with joggers and off-leash dog walkers. The park is well-treed with lots of grass and is home to lot of birds and funny little squirrels with spiky head hair. The park has at least two playgrounds in it and tons of park benches to stop for snacks, enjoying the view, changing diapers etc. One of the main attractions of the park is the 75\u2032 tall working metronome, which is a wonderful replacement for the Joseph Stalin statue which used to sit there (it was the largest Stalin statue in the world, but it was destroyed by Krushchev in 1962). The metronome symbolizes the long struggle of the Czech Republic against Soviet control. It\u2019s located in a plaza with nice views of the city below. The kids had a lot of fun running and climbing stuff all around the plaza. After our little guy\u2019s nap, we went for a stroll on the promenade along the banks of the Vltava River, from Stefanikuv most bridge to the Manvesuv most bridge.

There are dedicated bike lanes in some portions and where there were not the bikers who used the path seemed careful and courteous.

I had perceived that I had done something to upset the organizer of this event a few months prior so I did not particularly wish to reach out and speak with him because I did not want relations strained more. The person I was chatting with sent me an invitation via instant messenger which went something like: \"Your presence is required Thursday at 8:00 pm.\" I had to give him directions to my place as I don't have the money for a car and he didn't care because he had a car rented for the duration of his stay. I actually delayed proceedings a bit because I was trying to get pictures done. A few people like what I can draw, although I don't think I'm all that particularly good, and since I didn't have an exorbitant amount of money like the person organizing the event, I wanted to do what little I could to contribute to the occasion. We ate at a restaurant where I could never go on my own. The most inexpensive item was something like $60!

I had just attended a lecture at the time, and I found the content extremely emotionally draining, so I wasn't in an excellent mood to begin with. The location where my tire blew out was congested with heavy rush hour traffic; my car broke down next to a sidewalk that was labeled \"no stopping any time.\" Many cars honked at me despite my obvious predicament. A woman in a giant black Mercedes halted everyone behind her to shout at me from her window; she had a thick Kardashian accent and a Starbucks cup in her hand as she called, \"The sign says NO STOPPING ANY TIME.\" I rushed to replace the tire, but I am a very small, not particularly strong person, so it was a slow going process. An older man in ragged clothes who smelled heavily of dirt and sweat approached me. My stomach dropped with dread. While I am generally not a cruel person and welcome interactions with people in unfortunate situations, being stuck as I was in ninety degree heat with drivers around me shouting angrily and honking, I wasn't in the most convenient position to help anyone. I didn't have any cash with me to give him, and I didn't know if I could handle a heart-wrenching conversation about how horrendous life can be or learning about the man's visions from God, if he had them. It wasn't kind of me, and in retrospect I am not proud of my feelings when he first approached. My anxieties were unfounded, and unfair. The man said nothing to me. He bent down beside my ruined tire, and began removing it from the car.  I have never been so moved by anything in my life. A person who I had unfairly feared, a man who was so much less fortunate than every luxury-vehicle driving heckler that drove by, was the only person who stopped to help me change my tire.

I still wake up and wonder about our true purpose in life, and how we come into play when called upon. Things happen in our lives which we really do not understand. We certainly do not have full control over all aspects of our lives. The element of surprise is always a real variable for which can play upon our actions at any time, and any place. What took place recently for me was certainly an element of surprise for which I was called to action without warning, or preparation. What this event did prove to me was that our worth as human beings is gauged by what we know, proving once again that knowledge is a very powerful force which absolutely can save lives. One particular morning I decided to stop into a major store to check on something I was interested in purchasing. For no other reason would I have been there that day. The real reason perhaps may have been out of my control, as though I was guided there to be in place for my contribution to mankind. As I was strolling through the store looking for my item of interest, I could not help noticing that someone seemed a bit irritated and somewhat irrational in how they were communicating with another person. I didn't think much about it and continued about my business. Just moments later, it was obvious that this person was having some sort of medical problem due to their behavior and the apparent breathing problems that I had detected. I am CPR certified, and am trained on what to do in case of a medical emergency. Probably a good thing since there was not anyone else around the scene which I believe was in any position to help this person. I then took control and intervened immediately to check on the situation. As I had surmised, the person in trouble was an elderly man who had just collapsed, struggling to breath, and very incoherent to response. Immediately I commanded the closest person to call 911 and get help as fast as possible. I then evaluated the situation and began administering CPR until the medics could arrive. I noticed that the man had a medical bracelet  for which I instructed the caller to give that information to the 911 center to prepare the medics as they were en route to the scene. What seemed like an eternity to save this man's life while I was still in control, became like a major relief once the EMS team arrived, and took over. In short, The man lived without any severe consequences, and was doing great after a short stay in the hospital. This gave me a whole new perspective on life, and just how fragile we really are as we go about our lives.

This position is a career path that I hadn't necessarily thought of in my youth, but I did always have it in my mind that I wanted to be a direct help to my community, either through police work, fire work or other service aspect. Following my son's birth in May 2018, I talked to my wife about these aspirations as it was a far cry from what I am currently doing. She was thrilled to hear about this idea despite the dangers the career path could put me on. I started the lengthy process that summer which consisted of detailed applications, written tests and the latest step, the CPAT. The CPAT process started this summer, around May 2019. There were several opportunities to prepare and pass the test, yet I kept falling short. What was encouraging, aside from my wife, was that each leg of the process I was getting better. While I wouldn't pass during the attempts nor the practices, I was able to improve a little each time without any regression. On my final attempt, I was beyond nervous. The difference between passing and failing this test was the difference between continuing on my path versus waiting THREE YEARS to try again. Needing to put my family in a financially stable position, failing was not an option. I buckled down and drove through that test to the best of my ability, finishing with just under 40 seconds left on the clock. I still was not where I want to be physically, but I passed which is all that they were concerned with.

I work in customer service and I am on the phones 8 hours a day 5 days a week. I was slowing loosing my voice and then boom, I woke up and my phone was gone. I couldn't talk and when attempting to do so, it was very painful. This was the week before memorial weekend. I reached out to my boss via email and explained the situation to her, she had already been aware that my voice was in bad shape.   I had to call out. I called out but didn't go to the doctor that day. I figured I would drink some tea, and would be fine, well I had hoped I would be fine. I woke up the next day, which was my day off and it had gotten worse. my glands were severely swollen. I didn't have health insurance so I had no choice but to go to the hospital, which I incurred a $800 bill due to that visit. Now I forgot to mention that fact, that now my glands are swollen I freaked out, because my dad had passed away from throat cancer and prior to that so did his father. I was scared to death sitting in the waiting area, waiting to be called. After sitting in the waiting room literally for 4 hours I was then seen by urgent care. He looked in my throat never even checked my glands and told me it's possible it was a virus. He gave me a shot of Steroids in which he stated will help the swelling to go down, and he made me an appointment with an ENT specialist. The appointment was 2 weeks away. My voice got a little better, but there was no way I was able to talk on the phones for 8 hours especially since I had 3 upsells per phone call. I used up my personal days. I reached out to my boss and informed her that I was going to have to resign, my appointment was two weeks away, I was freaking out thinking it might be cancer. The doctor only gave me a note for 3 days. if I was out one more day. She put a recommendation in for me to be rehired. I went to my ENT doctor and he said I had a virus and he took a better look at my glands and said my glands being swollen was due to me having blockage in one of my saliva glands and not drinking enough water caused it to flair up and lose my voice.", "label": "recalled", "group": "Y4L2YXXH"}

His condition was not improving, so we thought the trip would be a great way for all of us to bond with him at least one last time. The actual trip itself was fantastic. I had never been on a cruise before, and although I was slightly nervous given the way the media portrays cruises (i.e. Titanic), once I got on board I had forgotten all about that. The boat was huge and beautiful and there were friendly faces where ever you went. There were musical performances every night, and so many activities every day to do, from quiz shows based on disney properties, to learning how to fold towels into animals. There was even a theater on the ship, where I saw Coco for the first time (which I definitely teared up over). But the best thing was the food. There were a lot of restaurants, each with their own theme. Between buffets in the morning and five star meals in the evening, I was never hungry. My grandfather was with us for most of the activities, but there was one instance that gave us quite a scare. As I was moving around the ship with my sister, I received a message from my uncle telling me to come to his cabin immediately. Apparently my grandfather was really not doing well. When we got to the cabin the rest of the family was surrounding him as he laid still on the bed. There was a look of concern on everyone's face. My mom was trying to get him to eat a banana earlier, but he had stopped eating. As we were all looking at him worriedly, he suddenly jumped up and bit the banana that was in my mom's hand.

My friends were overjoyed that I would invite them to such a program because it was something that touched the hearts of all of us.

Then there were some that felt love was a hummingbird that sought nectar from all of life. I could not help but agre with all three sentiments and feel that love takes many forms. some of these forms are seen in relationships between two people. Another form is between a parent and a child. There is also the form of love between friends which is most equal. There also exists a form of love between a teacher and a student.

I met many interesting managers, owners and employees in many of them, but the most memorable to me was with a man who was Sales Director at first, and is now one of the owners of a gallery in Chelsea.  I went to his gallery 5 or 6 times, but it was not only because I liked the painters he represented, but because I enjoyed talking and playing nice and sophisticated verbal 'games' with him.  He was very engaging as I talked to him about recommending some of one of his artists'  paintings to my sister, a collector, but even before that e discussed ballet because of one of the paintings that included a ballet  dancer, about which I am very knowledgeable.  He is not quite a close friend yet, but I was very impressed with his graceful technique, which most with the purpose of selling do not do nearly that well, so it looks like it will be something to look forward to in the coming months and years since I live close by and can go there often. Once there were some poster-type paintings, one of which included the George Bernard Shaw quote \"If you say something cannot be done, do not interrupt those who are doing it\".  I told him about how funny I thought it was, and this was a kind of teasing that he responded to, understanding me completely.  That was the second time I went to that gallery, mostly to see what had changed from coming early.  He is a very experienced gallerist, and always patiently took time with the two artists I settled on, the two who interested me and who interested my sister, who is a collector.  I found out she was interested in these works from an attachment he sent me, there were two abstract painters from which she might still choose to have in her home in Georgia.  He then extended the invitation to me and her alike to visit the favourite painter's studio in New Jersey when she is ready for purchase.  She comes to town once or twice a year, so she was excited that we would be able to do this.  She has outlined her preference in colour to narrow it down for what works best in her home.  I stay in touch with him about this eventuality, which may not happen due to family health problems till spring, but I also just go over and visit with him to see what new work he is showing and talk to him about art in general.  It's a good physical exercise (the gallery is a little over a mile walk for me), and he is always funny and generous about giving me more information on the artists.

It felt more special than any other wedding because it was mine and I was surrounded by the people who mattered most to not only me but my husband. We had the ceremony in the backyard of the ranch, overlooking the mountains next to us. We could hear the river flowing below us as we recited our vows we wrote to each other. I will never forget seeing my husband\u2019s face when I walked to him down the aisle. I knew I was marrying the right man when I took the tears from his eyes. The most magical part of the wedding was after our ceremony. We just barely had enough time to finish family photos before it started to rain over the mountains. We all ran inside and then to the pavilion. I remember standing there looking at the rain coming over the mountains and I was in awe. Standing there with my family and friends and new husband meant the world to me because I had just started the new chapter of my life and I had them all with me. The rain was breathtaking. I knew the rain signified that our relationship would last through anything and I constantly look back at that moment as my favorite. We had spent months and years planning this wedding and it was definitely the most significant aspect of my life to date. I would love to write about this event in the future.", "label": "recalled", "group": "AVQYBEAS"}

We implemented \"cousin camp\" this year, where we got together with the 4 cousins and did fun things all together. We went to a science museum, a splash pad, a trampoline park, out to eat, and swimming. The kids (they're all 7 and under) had a great time doing smaller, low-stress \"local\" things. It was fun to bond with my sister. I am still suprised that we are the \"grown ups\"! I love seeing our children bond. I also loved the rare opportunity I had to disconnect from work and just play for a few weeks. On the way home, I stopped with my daughters at a state park after seeing a sign for it at an exit on the interstate. It was a lot longer of a trip off of the interstate than i would have thought, and I almost turned around. But, we went all the way out there, hiked a trail, and then went swimming in the suprisingly awesome pool (with a big slide!). My newly 6 year old daredevil of a daughter was very interested in the slide, so she ran stairs while her sister and I frolicked around. After that, we went to eat pizza at a local place. We hit terrible rush hour traffic on the way home. All of us were all nearly in tears at the length of the trip home (generally 4 hours, but way longer on this occasion).", "label": "retold", "group": "V2UJ18KU"}

My sister's ex fiance and father of the baby chose not to be a part of her pregnancy or the baby's life and that made me sad for her and my nephew. I feel a great responsibility to guide her with taking care of a child since I have two of my own children. The moment I got to hold my nephew was such a happy time. Looking at his innocent face, I wonder how his father could ever make the decision not to be a part of his life. I fully accept the responsibility of helping her raise this precious child. We have room in our basement for them to live when they leave the hospital. I felt good to know that I can provide them with shelter, food and love. I feel certain I can be a positive influence in this baby's life. I plan on encouraging my sister to finish getting her bachelor's degree and keep her motivated.

I get to immigration and someone tells me to sit down and nobody says a word to me for about an hour. I terrified that one of the military officers with AK-47s are just going to shoot me in the face and get it over with.  I go over everything that I could have done wrong and after nearly calling my mom and asking for a teddy bear I find out that the Vietnamese Consulate in SF made a mistake on my Visa and everything is fine. I hate them but its fine.    After finally getting through immigration and getting my bags I finally go outside to find a taxi to my hotel. Its about three in the morning but surprisingly there a lot of option. Some guy runs over and asks if I need a taxi and I say yes so we head over to his car. He says it will cost forty dollars and I say im only using the meter since this was something I read constantly. We go back and fourth and he says he doesnt have one. I finally say okay since im completely exhausted and I dont care at this point.

We went miniature golfing. We rented canoes on a lake nearby. One weekend we went hiking. Another weekend we went camping. We went to a museum. And generally had a good time each day whatever we decided to do. I tried to keep the boys busy throughout each day so that they wouldn't be tempted to spend days on the couch playing video games.  Or being on their computers. All in all we had a very nice Summer. The boys not only had fun, but they learned some things. I must say that as the Summer was coming to a close, I really thought that I was looking forward to them heading back to school. But once they went back, I really missed them and it made me sad. The house seemed very empty each day. Especially for the first month. I was surprised. I thought I so wanted my alone time.

This was about 4 months ago, and was in the south of Spain, a part of Spain I had never been to before. Before the trip, I was extremely busy and had very limited time to actually plan the trip. Therefore, I had fairly low expectations about it and didn't think too much about it until it actually happened. I had been fairly often to Spain before (mostly the North), and therefore thought that the South was very similar to it culturally. However, once I arrived to Ubeda, the little village where my friend's wedding was taking place, I realized I had been all wrong. The streets were narrow, the town was full of culture and beautiful monuments due to the its rich history and culture, and I couldn't believe my eyes. The trip made a strong impression on me and made me fall in love with the town. People were friendly, the food was delicious. Over there, people have jamon, with bread, tomatoes, and olive oil at breakfast. Initially, it seemed strange to me but by the third day, it seemed so natural to me and I feel like I had lived there my whole life. My best friend's family was warm and lovely as well. I realized quickly that it was a defining personality trait of people from the south of Spain. Toward the end of my week-long trip, I began dreading my departure from the city, and tried to take as many mental pictures of the trip as I could so I would never forget it. Specifically, the wedding cathedral, the endless olive oil fields, the jamon available at every restaurant in town, the beautiful weather and the friendliness of the people.

It was very helpful for my child to select ones they are interested in and would pursue their studies in the future. It is is very important to touch these necessary information early prior to their application deadlines. We drove to a few cities nearby where the universities we are interested in located. We visited 2 schools each day during this trip. We first visited a few schools on the east coast, then visited others on the southwest side. A few Ivy leagues schools were included into this trip. According to the well known rule, we divided these schools into three categories, reach, match, and safe to schedule our visit concentrations. For a reach school, we focused on to learn more about the admission policy. For a match or safe school, we concentrated on the required documents including SAT test scores. During the visit, we figured out which major could be more promising one when applying for a reach school, considering as a premed track student later on. For a match or safe school, we strictly followed up the most interested major such as Biomedical engineering in one engineering school. We compared the similar ranks of schools in terms of student population size, campus life, major strength, faculty to student ratio etc. We finally narrowed down to 10 schools in our list. One of things need to mentioned especially here: be sure to check in on time prior to your information session. For example, WashU treated a campus visiting as the demonstrated interesting of a student on them. Some of schools followed up us after our campus visiting. It is also useful for a family to on-site check the student residence and meal plan in one specific school.

So, every time that I passed by her I would say something. Trying to get her to talk. We had brief conversations. When I say brief I mean really brief. I should have asked her for her name. I did not. If i were to ever run into this person again. I might ask her for her name. She was supper pretty.", "label": "recalled", "group": "2WAK6AN9"}

We purchased their best plants and then headed out to enjoy the rest of the nature and scenery as well as a few other fun activities. We decided to do a bit of hiking in some near by woods, set down on a homemade blanket my mom made me when I was 12 and enjoyed our surroundings whilst lighting up a blaze. I laid back to admire the tall tress reaching for the heavens, I closed my eyes to listen to the wind blowing through the leaves. I could hear the others laughing and talking among themselves and I smiled, I smiled because they were smiling. I stretched out my arms, stretched them out as wide as I could, as if I was trying to each either side of the woods. I dug my fingers into the soil, as the soil dug back deep underneath my finger nails. After passing our rolled plant around a bit, a few puffs later we decided to head down to a local ranch to do a bit of horseback riding but first we stopped by a casino because someone wanted to hit the slots. I'm not much for throwing my coins down the toilet so I just watched the others and after just a bit we left. When we finally got to the ranch my head was a bit funny, I had the giggles and the horses were absolutely stunning. We went into the barn to pick out the horses we wanted and I picked out the one that I felt was my spirit animal, her name was June and she was magnificent. We all got saddled up and started along a path, the sun was shinning, the whether was perfect and I had this powerful beast between my legs, it was turning out to be the perfect day, until I slipped off and nearly busted my ass; turns out I got so wrapped up in the moment that I forgot to hold on to the reins. After falling off the horse, I was a little shook but I barely felt a thing, thanks to the legal plants we part took earlier that day. We headed to a local dinner after the ranch, being that we were all starving and/or had the munchies; I ordered something greasy and unhealthy, like the rest; I promise to hit the gym sometime next Tuesday. After a long day we all headed back, I fell asleep in the back of the car, my head resting of the shoulder of my BFF and my wannabe lover, with the light summer breeze on my skin, and a smile permanently print on my soul...This was definitely a day I will always remember.", "label": "imagined", "group": "V8UTCOOB"}

She once told me a story about how when she was growing up her father made her feel abandoned. He would say he was going to come pick her up, and she would sit on the curb outside her house waiting with her luggage. She would sit there for hours and he would never show up. Now when I think about that story I feel bitter. She has done the very same thing to her family. She leaves on a whim with almost no notice and is gone for months. This will be the third time she has done this. She even knowingly missed my sons birth. He is her only grandson. She says she's excited about him and then leaves and misses out on his milestones.

My girlfriend was in Miami, planning to visit me for our birthdays. Needless to say, when she arrived, our plans were all cancelled. I tried my best to continue on with our travel plans but the pain was horrible. We ended up at the ER after a week of her visiting. I was admitted immediately into the hospital. I was losing feeling in my right foot. The doctors in ER were concerned and scheduled emergency back surgery for the next morning.  My girl didn't skip a beat. She left the hospital and went back to take care of my dogs. The next day she was back and stayed by my side until I was released. I wasn't able to lift or walk much. She offered to stay on in AZ for an additional three weeks to help me with bathing, walking, cooking, basically everything I'd need during my recovery. I couldn't drive so she has to do shopping and take the dogs out on their daily walks. I don't know how I would have survived this time without her by my side. She really showed me what true love and friendship is all about. She didn't ask for anything in return. She was supportive in every way imaginable and I saw what a genuine, wonderful woman she is. Before she returned to FL, we decided we'd get an apartment and she would come back to help even more. I found a place 2 blocks from my office. This helped  with my recovery and instead of driving 2 hours every day, I now drive 2 minutes one way.

Doctors came rushing in, they ended up having to usher me out; they had to a CT scan/MRI on him. They found that he had 3 damaged heart valves, and because of that, his heart wasn't able to get enough of his oxygen in his blood to his lungs and every subsequent problem. He had to have emergency heart surgery. Recovery was expected to take 6 months, with very light exercise after 3 months. Only 2 more months left until he's fully recovered.

After breakfast, we hopped in the car and we drove off to meet up with the rest of the family. When we arrived at the aquarium, we found a parking spot and pulled in. We had arrived a little bit early so we sat in the car and waited for my sister to show up. We saw their car pull into the parking lot and my dad waved them over so they could park near us. Their family got out of the car and I gave my sister and her husband a hug since I hadn't seen them in a long time. I said hi to my nieces and we walked over to the entrance to the Aquarium. We got in line to get in as we looked at the walls painted with water and fish images. My nieces were enthralled by the walls and we hadn't even gotten inside yet. Upon walking through the gate, we were greeted by a large water tank filled with colorful fish and plantlife. My nieces immediately ran up to the tank and pressed their faces against it so they could look at it closely. We all laughed at how excited the girls were as we discussed where to go first. We decided to visit the penguins first since one of my nieces loves penguins. We walked down a hallway that had been painted to look like a glacier as we approached the room with penguins in it. Inside, there was a tank with water and ice and several penguins were swimming while others were walking around on top of the ice. My niece shrieked with excitement and started jumping up and down. We then visited the exhibit that had a couple sharks in it, but didn't stay for long since my nieces were a bit creeped out due to the darkness of the room and the sharks. We then stopped off to see a killer whale, but it was quite busy so we didn't get a great look at it. We stopped off at the gift shop on the way out and my nieces both got a stuffed penguin. We said our goodbyes and we drove our separate ways after having a very fun day with each other.", "label": "imagined", "group": "8SZ60C1E"}

But I have never been his sole protector and advocate during one.  I have prayed that I would never see the day that I would be alone with him when one happened. But that day came. My husband and I went to their home to babysit so my daughter and son-in-law could go to an evening wedding of a friend.  As my grandson stood at the window waving goodbye to them, he turned slightly towards me and became rigid. I knew that he was about to go into a seizure. I laid him gently on the carpet and turned him onto his side. I told my husband to run outside and try to flag them down. I grabbed my cell phone to note what time the seizure began.  I made sure he was breathing. He jerked slightly for about a minute, and then his body relaxed and he gave a big sigh.  It was over. My husband had been able to stop them, and they all came in around that point. My grandson was very confused, and then became  sleepy, so my daughter held him for a long nap. I was very emotionally drained afterwards.  When someone has a seizure they are totally defenseless and helpless. My grandson's frailties and vulnerabilities was driven into me that evening.  It was a traumatizing event for me.   If someone near you has a seizure, you must act to help them. Get them safely to the ground, otherwise a fall could be very injurious or even fatal. Turn them to their side to keep the airway open. If they have been eating, clear the mouth. Note the time, and call for help if it goes over two minutes.", "label": "recalled", "group": "XJRWM8MF"}

My aunt and i decided to do a little traveling and considered how we would do this. we thought about taking a train but that would have been a limiting factor if we wanted to make a stop here and there. so Judy (who is my aunt of course) said \"Lets take a road trip instead! it would be fun\" and of course i agreed and off we went. Thought out the course of 8 days we did a ton of sight seeing as well as hiking and some swimming! We stayed at a few 5 star hotels but we rather sleep under the stars so we would set up some tents and star gaze looking for the famous fast streaks in the sky that shooting stars often leave. But the best part of this story is the friends and family we stopped to visit! the first stop we made was at my friends Rudy's house and with out notice because we wanted to to be a surprise. Well guess what? The surprise was on us! Rudy (who is a long time friend Judy and i) was getting married! And was throwing a party that night (we were dipping into the punch bowl more then once might i add) but that's not the exciting part, he is getting married to my sister! No one told me about it because they wanted it to be a surprise using this magical road trip i went on.  so in the following days Judy and i continued to stop at some more friends houses before we attended the wedding. Let me tell, you it was the most amazing wedding i ever attended. we threw more rice that day then we could of possibly eaten in a year. At the reception, we danced till we dropped an let me tell you my legs were soooo sore the next day i could of stayed in bed for a week! Judy and i had an absolute blast at the wedding and a day to remember for the rest of our lives. In conclusion Judy an i do plan on another road trip but that is all i will say for now but you will want to tune in for that trip because we plan on something very special!", "label": "imagined", "group": "F2KENH2U"}

See, Asian families have this idea of who a perfect partner for your child is. The thing they don't understand is that they want their child to marry a stranger just because they like that person, not even considering the opinion or the choice of their own child. Our case was similar. He was tall and I was short, I was a bit on the chubby side and I wore glasses. The only issue his family had with me was that I was fat, ugly and a christian. Too bad they didn't realize that I was a warrior. There was this one time when his father actually told my father that I was fat, and my father responded saying, \"I feed my children well and unlike your kids mine aren't malnourished.\"!

This of course leads to its own types of pain, but they're more manageable. Anyway, recently I had been doing my walking meditation as usual. I like to do an hour a day whenever I can since I work from home and can leave my computer for short times here and there. I usually break this down into 10-15 minute sessions just to make it easier to get the practice in without disturbing my work day too much. One late afternoon/early evening I was doing my walking and reached a very peaceful and tranquil state. My mind was significantly more quiet than it usually is, although there were still thoughts bubbling up here and there. I also realized at the time that the movement in my mind was starting to slow down. My mind was no longer jumping from one thought to another endlessly. This mental state continued for a few minutes as I continued to pace back and forth on my walking path and just observed it.

Fast forward again to three months ago. I'm checking Facebook and I see a post in the group for my old neighborhood I lived in the year prior. A lady found a cat in the neighborhood and he had been badly beat up. She initially brought him in to rehab him for a catch and release, but he didn't want to be released. I was immediately drawn to this cat, so I messaged my girlfriend and asked her, \"What do you think?\" She immediately responded \"YES, you're more of a cat person anyways.\" Thinking that a cat surely would be more practical for me since I lived in an apartment, I went to visit the cat and immediately fell in love with him. He was so cute and reserved, and the lady swore to me that he would eventually open up to me and be the biggest cuddle cat in the world. I took him home that day, and he's been my cuddly cat ever since. I realized that I really am a cat person, and that cats are just so much better to have as a pet when living in an apartment building. He is the best decision I've made within the last 3 months, at least if you don't ask my wallet.", "label": "recalled", "group": "YC3TI6KQ"}

Where I wish she would have just listened to us when we said the migraines weren't normal, and for a woman like my mom to be bedridden for days in pain was not normal. She never listened until that day. Seizures in the kitchen, collapsing. My father calling to hospital, only because she was too sick to say no at that point... She only lived for three months after that day. They did scans of her brain around the clock, while my father and I shared wooden and metal benches to sleep on, waking up only to see if there was any news. Once we got the news, they told us she would die soon. I couldn't take it, her laying there, lifeless and empty. The same woman who danced me around the kitchen to Elton John and Stevie Nicks, now laying lifeless incapable of the most basic human tasks. I begged my father to pull the plug on the day before her last, crying hysterically. He was trying to hang on to her, she was suffering, she was never coming back, the cancer had spread too far. When she died, her lifeless face broke into somewhat of a smile and her eyes sealed like a tomb, or maybe that's just the grief talking.", "label": "imagined", "group": "H01I5LXX"}

This greatly annoyed my girlfriend because she thought I was just doing it to be a pain in the butt. We did not argue about this until I had come back from the store. All in all, we probably fussed about the issue for a few minutes before it seemed the issue had been resolved. I was wrong. Later on that night my girlfriend unexpectedly slapped me across the face and told me it was because of my behavior earlier. I was very shocked because this had never happened before. I did not react much because I was so taken off guard. She did not react much either. She just simply told me to continue watching TV and acted like it never happened. Later on that same night she proceeded to hit me three more times. This was for a different reason than the argument we had had earlier. I did not hit her back after any of these attempts.

That's when it happened; the event would change the course of my life for the next several months. On my way upstairs, I slipped on the wooden steps. Somehow I tripped and my left foot got caught underneath me.  I crawled up the rest of the steps to take stock of what had happened. I was hoping it was just some kind of sprain but I had no idea. I had a client meeting and it was too late to reschedule for that day. So in considerable pain, I showered, shaved, and got dressed. It was no simple task to put on shoes but my foot was not yet swollen so it wasn't impossible. I was able to walk painfully with a limp. I dealt with the meeting. I went to urgent care where an x-ray was taken. All told, I had 4 broken metatarsals. One was seriously dislocated. I would end up needing two surgeries. And nearly three months later, I still cannot put weight on this foot. So much for summer and all of my grand plans. So much can change in the course of a minute.

A gust of wind blew over the windscreen set up around the stove and toppled the pot of water off of the stove. The water was forced out of the pot and onto my abdomen. Fortunately, I had cell service and called 911. I was instructed to put cold water on the burn while I waited for the ambulance to arrive, but the only thing I had available was a cold bottle of Gatorade. I held the cold bottle to my abdomen while the dispatcher was trying to figure out exactly where I was located. My call had hit a cell tower in a different county. It took the ambulance 30 minutes to get to me and another 30 minutes to get me to the hospital. The wait seemed like an eternity, and I was feeling the worst pain I ever felt in my life. The emergency department doctor told me I had second and third degree burns over 45 percent of my abdomen. I passed out immediately after they gave me a shot of morphine. When I woke up, I no longer felt pain. They put a special ointment on my burn that totally relieved the pain. I needed to get back to my campsite, where my vehicle was located. The hospital called a taxi for me, and I was sent back to my primitive campsite. I felt very weak and could not pack my camping gear into my vehicle, so I ended up sleeping in my hammock. I spent two days in that hammock, trying to get the strength for the two and a half hour drive home. When I finally arrived home, I had to go to another emergency room to have my burn cleaned.

He was being expected to work the jobs of three people and only get underpaid for the job of one person.  He was stressed and fed up with the job so he decided to start his own business.  Literally only a month and a half later, with only a company name and super basic website, his boss found out about the new business and fired him on the spot.  No questions were asked - he assumed my husband was trying to undercut the company and steal work.  My husband had no such desire, he wanted to get away from the work that company did but was planning to stay with the company until his contracts that he had brought in were completed since nobody else in the company was qualified to work on those contracts.  Its also worth mentioning that at least three other employees were doing side work or had side businesses and the boss had no problems with that what so ever.  So now we are still working super hard to get this new business up and running.  It normally takes a long time to get a business off the ground so we are really struggling.  My husband is working long hours and much of it is without pay because its just his efforts towards a blog and another project that does not have funding yet.  We are hopeful for the future but there is a lot that is still unsure in our lives.  I am doing my best to be a supportive and encouraging wife and contribute as I can.

I had never met the woman, but I've so many stories that I feel like I did.  This past July, her family and I flew out to the Big Island in Hawaii to spread the ashes.  The day came to spread the ashes and we made the picturesque drive across the Island to the Hawaii Tropical Botanical Garden.  I have never seen such breathtaking sights in my entire life: lush, verdant, practically alien-to-me plants everywhere; the most colorful flowers you can imagine; awe-inspiring waterfalls; and a medley of countless exotic birds all singing their enchanting island songs.  Once we arrived to the gardens and began the descent down the trail, it was even more sublime than the drive.  I truly felt like I was transported to another reality in which nothing existed but this sprawling, magical rain forest.  I was nervous that the day was going to be difficult for my girlfriend, her sister and all their children, but I approached it with a level of confidence in my abilities to comfort that I didn't even know existed.  We gathered at a stopping point and everyone said words that celebrated the life that had been lost.  The plan for everyone to find spots in the gardens that spoke to them and spread portions of the ashes.  The remains were divvied up and we resumed our journey downward. The atmosphere grew quiet and the birds almost seemed to sense this:  their songs had quieted into barely audible chirps.  Everyone's faces had a mixture of sorrow and happiness and I just maintained a stoic, yet positive look throughout.  The silence was interrupted by my girlfriend's oldest daughter who shrieked as she sprinkled some of the ashes, \"Ewwwww bones!\"  My stomach sank for a moment, but everyone else chuckled a little bit and we moved on. The group slowly began to separate a little bit and my girlfriend led me down a path as she clutched my hand.  \"Find a place that you'd like to spread some,\" she said.  I panicked for a moment and said, \"I don't think that's appropri---.\"  She cut me off with a firm shush.  \"She would have loved you.  Please do this for me,\" my girlfriend said as tears were welling up in her eyes.  I quickly, albeit a bit reluctantly, agreed. A few moments later we came to a majestic, spindly tree reaching higher than all the others around it.  A solitary bright beam of sunlight was gleaming through the canopy above and had illuminated an orchid.  The orchid was a beautiful mixture of purple fading into pink with little flecks of periwinkle on all the petals and it was swaying ever-so-slightly from a breeze; I knew this was the place. As I sprinkled the ash just underneath the orchid onto the moss-covered ground, the birds stopped singing entirely and I was enraptured by a tender, touching silence like I had never experienced in my life.", "label": "recalled", "group": "WVDFZ9QG"}

And it's not usually the native populations who win in the end. What's happening with Mauna Kea is \"no different than what they did to the Native American Indians in Arizona,For the Native Hawaiians, it is not a question of faith against science. It's cultural preservation versus blind commercialism \u2013 the prioritization of capital over human interest. Located on the Big Island, Mauna Kea is not only an inactive volcano, but also the globe's highest sea mountain. For a decade now, international scientists have aimed to build the $1.4 billion project on the land, due to the absence of both light pollution and moisture in the air. Supporters favor the predicted economic growth with accompanying job opportunities. But the plan has encountered indigenous opposition every step of the way. At this point, thousands of Hawaiians have engaged in peaceful protest, blocking passage to the summit. K\u016bpuna, or elders, gather at the forefront. 30 elders were arrested at the the Mauna Kea access road as they attempted to block construction crews from proceeding up the mountain. They are not disputing technological progress, but pushing to maintain a sacred site of Hawaiian spirituality. Already the summit hosts 13 other telescopes that dishonor Mauna Kea's true purposes. Mauna Kea means respecting the earth. With its delicate ecosystem, the mountain and its endangered species face threats from human development, like habitat loss. Ultimately, it means native rights. So much social justice nowadays centers around finally giving indigenous communities \u2013 peoples with irrefutable historic connections to these lands \u2013 their duThanks to international media coverage and campaigns to #ProtectMaunaKea, the Thirty Meter Telescope announced a potential alternative to construct on the Canary Islands.

But that only occurred the month prior. My aunt and I compared notes that month and she had experienced the same thing and that was the first clue that anything was wrong. My mother retired to Florida about 20 years ago, my aunt lives in Ohio and I live in Texas and we get to see each other maybe once a year. My mother is 80 so she doesn't do email or text and she doesn't have a smartphone, just the old style flip phone with the big numbers on it. But we all talk to each other almost every week, that is, we used to talk to each other each week until this past March when we saw the first signs. Then April rolled around and that's the month of my birthday and she always calls on that day but this year there was no call. I let it pass and didn't think much of it until my aunt called me towards the end of April when we both realized neither of us had spoken to her for the entire month. We call my brother went over there and found her in bed pretty much incoherent, the condo was a mess and she mumbled something about falling. He took her to the hospital to get her checked out and the doctor said there were no signs of a stroke but he saw bruising on her hip, knee and arm and noted that he thought she probably had taken a bad fall so she stayed in the hospital for a few days under observation. The doctor told them she needed a walker because her knee was not supporting her weight very well and also advised them to have her schedule an appointment with her primary physician because she probably needed a brain scan to rule out other causes of her confusion. It was 3 weeks before she was able to get the brain scan and the confirmed diagnosis at that point was Alzheimer's. She was in a long term care facility within a month and she started losing ground fast. She no longer recognized anyone and she couldn't use the phone at all anymore so no more phone calls. After 2 months she quit eating and they had to put her in hospice which is where she remains today. She gets more attention there and has recovered at least some of the body weight she lost because she simply didn't experience or recognize hunger any longer.

Her street was plugged with cars. A thick line of them crept forward at the end of her driveway. There are five routes out of Paradise. The three major ones spread south like the legs of a tripod, passing through the heart of town and continuing downhill toward Chico and the valley below. Fisher lived in the northern part of town, on the easternmost leg of the tripod, Pentz Road; she rented a bedroom from a woman who worked at a nursing home in town. It baffled her to see that all the cars in front of her house were heading north on Pentz, cramming themselves away from the center of Paradise, away from the valley, and further uphill. The opposite lane, meanwhile, was totally empty. It seemed obvious to Fisher that, if the fire was approaching from somewhere in the canyon behind her house, there would be plenty of Paradise left in which to safely wait it out. So she pushed across the traffic, into the empty lane. But she barely went 100 yards before a driver sitting in the jam alongside her rolled down his window and explained that Pentz was blocked up ahead.", "label": "imagined", "group": "WME27YVY"}

Three months ago she and I decided to take a break from it all and booked a room at a hotel in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. To warrant the costs we treated it as an early anniversary gift to ourselves, as we were coming up on 10 years of being married. As my family is in another state, and her parents are no longer with us, we also booked our favorite babysitter to watch the three kids. The kids were ecstatic to learn that the babysitter was going to be watching them for two nights. We left once Lauren came and made our way to the White Mountains. It was a nostalgic trip up as we hadn't been in that area since before we were married. A lot had changed in the 10 plus years, more shops and everything looked new and expensive. The one exception was the restaurant that we had visited more times than we could count when we were fresh out of college and in that area, the Moat! We had dinner that night in the restaurant and walked through all that had changed since we were last there. We reflected on the hardships, where our life had turned in unforeseen ways and how little we were eventually prepared for all that had happened since. As we continued on throughout the weekend I reflected on how comfortable I had become with being next to my wife. Reflecting on the feeling I can only think of our relationship as a well worn tool that has seen the passage of hundreds of hours of time. Worn down a little, but smooth and comfortable. It sounds almost like a bad thing when I read it here but I also know that I find myself more and more in love with my wife the deeper into life we go.", "label": "recalled", "group": "C52NCKTK"}

Anyway two months ago my CPU suddenly just died. At first I had no idea what had went wrong, but apparently the cooling gel used to keep the CPU under extreme temps had mostly evaporated, so the CPU was over heating during my late night gaming sessions. At the point in time I didn't have enough money to buy a better CPU, I had just finished paying off a bunch of debt that I collected over the years. I pretty much thought I was screwed and maybe had to go out and get a temp job until I had enough money to replace my broken CPU. Anyway I had told my mom about it and I guess she told the family because a few days later my mom came over and handed me an envelop of money . At first I thought it was from her and I declined it, I didn't want to take my mother's hard earned money she got from working all those years. But she informed me a few of my brothers and sisters got together and pooled in money, enough that I could replace my CPU with a brand new powerful one. I'm not much of an emotional guy, at least in front of others. I try to always keep my cool and play it straight, but I couldn't help as the tears started to fall from my eyes. I was so grateful an thankful that people who loved and cared for me came through and went the extra mile for this. My family isn't rich, so I know them giving up their hard earned money to help me out was big. Not saying we're poor, but we're not rich enough were we can just give away money without a care in the world. My mom gave me a big hug and in that moment I felt the deepest amount of gratitude I ever experienced in my entire life. From the bottom of my heart I was truly deeply thankful.

My mother has been experiencing difficulty swallowing and shortness of breath for a few weeks now, and from some testing done since then doctors concluded that it was probably thyroid cancer. On Monday, she got an MRI (I think that's what it was) that gave the doctors a much clearer picture of what was going on. Anyway, they called her in for a consultation on Friday, and I went along just to provide support. After a little bit of bouncing around trying to find the right place (it was a new hospital), we were brought to a patient waiting room. A nurse took some preliminary readings and then left. Then a doctor came in to get an overview of events from my mother. I was there to add any details she'd missed, but I ended up not needing to. I mostly just sat in the corner and nodded. Anyway, before she had finished there was a knock on the door, and moments later there were about 10 people coming into the room - mostly doctors and a few nurses. They were all different specialties (radiation, chemotherapy, recovery therapy, etc.) but focused on throat and neck diseases. At this point, the room was fairly crowded so I was definitely aware of my position off in the corner. I was just trying to stay out of the way now. They ran a small camera into her nostril to check out the vocal cords. While it was in there, they asked her to do a few breathing/vocal exercises and to swallow water/applesauce. It was sort of hard to watch. It seemed like they spotted what they thought they'd seen because after a few seconds of recovery they began walking her through what they were thinking. Apparently the cancer had spread to her lymph nodes and lungs and was continuing to grow fast. I won't focus on the details here, but the plan was about two weeks of radiation as soon as possible and chemotherapy from there. The overall outlook looks very poor. Like I said, this was not information thrown at us all at once right then and there. The picture was revealed throughout the week via correspondence and examiner's reactions. Still, this was everything being laid out for sure. It was a moment of clarity I guess you could say. Then the doctors all explained how they would be involved in the process and introduced themselves and left for now - I'll end the story here because I'm getting the warning", "label": "recalled", "group": "LMR3GZ6H"}

We ended up choosing Anju, a new Korean place which had rave reviews. Next, I locked down the reservations, and made sure everybody knew when it was happening. However, we made sure to keep it a secret from Pablo, in hopes of surprising him. Once the night of the dinner arrived, I went over to Pablo's apartment to pick him up. He was a bit confused on what we were doing, but I told him we would go grab a slice of pizza or something. As we arrived at the Korean restaurant, Pablo begin to suspect that something was up. As soon as he seen all of our friends waiting outside, he knew he had been surprised. Everybody jumped out and yelled \"surprise\" in unison. It was really well done, and Pablo was laughing so hard he began to cry. We filed into the restaurant, and began our meal. We had a lot of laughs, told a lot of stories, and ate our fair share of delicious Korean cuisine. As we finished our main course, the staff came out with another surprise - a large chocolate cake, with \"goodbye Pablo\" spelled out in white icing. It looked amazing!

This was the first time I had ever been in an accident and I really hope it's the last time.  A man freaked out because he was surrounded by a motorcycle on each side of him and that caused the accident. My perspectiveAuto accidents can be very distressing.  When I was in my teens, my car was hit by a drunk driver while I was driving to a friend's house.  I was alone in the car.  It happened so quickly and so unexpectedly, I didn't have time to react or try to avoid being hit. He knocked my vehicle off the road and into a wooded area.  The windshield shattered, and several pieces of glass fell onto my lap.  I remember feeling stunned when it was over.  My hands were trembling and I couldn't open my car door - it had been pushed in too hard.  Several cars that witnessed the accident stopped to check on me, for which I was very grateful. The police arrived on the scene quickly.  They had to pry the driver side door off my car to get me out.  I still can't believe I wasn't seriously injured.  The police were rather aggressive with the other drive as it became very apparent that he was drunk.  They arrested him and took him away and then another officer very kindly drove me home, since my car was un-driveable.

I moved from my parents house and packed up all my belongings over the course of a week or so, then my girlfriend drove down from Northern Maine(I lived in Mass). We loaded up her car and mine, and began the 7 hour drive to our new place. After several weeks of preparation, organizing everything and getting stuff set up and purchased how we would need them, we were finally ready for this huge transition. In the coming weeks after that long drive, we unpacked everything and set up our new place how we wanted it. There was a lot of frustration and sweat and swearing as we struggled to shift furniture around the apartment, but we managed. Then some weeks later, I managed to find a job in a medical office. A position I took to readily and have since been excelling at. The actual act of moving was a stressful one, we spent a lot of time worrying ourselves over money, over my ability to find a job, over how I\"d manage to work out my schooling, all of it. Not to mention the fact that my family strongly disapproved of the decision and began treating me incredibly poorly once I broke the news to them. We drove for several hours before making our first stop, me trailing behind her, as her car was larger and she had packed it up to the point where she couldn't really see behind her. We stopped to pick up something to drink and use the restroom, as well as refuel our cars. THe drive was one we'd made many times before so the actual act of driving wasn't too bad, however, it was somewhat exhausting for her since she made the drive down just the day prior.

The rest of the trip was pretty uneventful, and we stopped first at our new apartment to drop off some of the stuff.

If you'd just DO what needs to be done instead of procrastinating and enforcing the cycle of dread and overwhelm. It took me a couple months to believe that I wasn't suddenly just a useless, lazy waste of oxygen. That I needed someone who wasn't me to judge the situation. I had a hard time with the meds at first. There's a stigma. And therapy didn't magically fix me either. All my therapist could do was try and teach me coping methods and how to recognize the warning signs. Recognizing that there was a chemical imbalance in my brain didn't immediately cure me. It wasn't a waste of time but I still had a lot of work to do and it took time. Somewhere in there I decided I was worth the effort. Not every day is perfect but I've really been feeling back to myself the past couple months and it's amazing the difference. I wonder how I didn't notice how off kilter I was when I was in the trenches. It seems obvious to me, now,that I shouldn't feel the need to cry over an, admittedly, endless pile of dishes in the sink. I shouldn't feel defeated at the thought of taking a shower. I hope I never forget how I felt in that hard time, so I feel compassion and understanding for those struggling and can do my best to help others while remaining reasonable and unoffended when I am unable to \"fix\" them.", "label": "imagined", "group": "D4SQBW98"}

It is a special event and there are a lot of extras like photo booths and face painting and things like that. We enjoy getting to go on all of the rides a lot faster and have the park not be very crowded. What was really memorable is that the Walking Dead ride was closed for the majority of the night. When it opened it was very late in the evening, but we made ourselves second in line. There was a woman in a wheel chair getting wheeled in  by her family just before us and she was mad and cussing that she had to go. Part way through the whole ride shut down and the lights came on. They told us to go to the emergency exits, but what was funny is zombies were running around not knowing what to do. Some were pointing at the emergency exits still in character. It was hilarious.

It had been thirty years since we last talked but, it felt like we hadn't talked for a few days instead. We talked about old times, all the things we did in high school all the trouble we had gotten into when we were younger. We discussed old friends and old loves we had. We discussed our families and anyone we were still in contact with. I learned that he had married one of our old friends from high school and we actually made plans to have dinner at his house so that I can meet their kids and see his wife again. Its crazy to think his youngest kid of 4 children is a senior in high school. I feel like it was only a couple years ago that we were having house parties and running from the cops. Of course, that's years ago now at this point. I found out that he had a few dark years after high school, he told me the trouble he got into. He spent a few years in jail for burglary, but said those days are long behind him. We are both old now. We kind of realized simultaneously at the restaurant how two punk kids whose parents and teachers told them they were going to be nothing ended up having pretty nice lives. Also, it didn't matter anyway all the people who had their sour opinions about us are dead at this point anyway. We talked for a few more hours, before we realized that it had been a few hours.

I started looking up plants online and watching other videos about plant identification. I started slowly by looking for one single type of plant and trying to identify it multiple times. After I was confident that I could identify the plant, I ate a couple of leaves just to test out the effects of it. I would wait a day and when nothing happened negative, I became more confident in my id's. I ate more the next time and continued to find out as much as I could about the plants habitat and features. Immersing myself in one plant at a time has been a great way to expand my knowledge. Now I can identify many plants in my area. I know the leaves, fruits, colors and features of a number of edible plants. This has given me a food source other than buying food from the grocery.

I feared getting into serious trouble. In July of last year I concluded that it was indeed taxable. So I made plans to see an accountant and file for back taxes. According to my research on Google the IRS was required to allow installment payments I could afford, but I was still quite apprehensive in the months leading up to the meeting. In March I met with the accountant, gave him documentation of the additional income, and paid him $400 for preparing four years' amended returns. This was considerably cheaper than my worst-case estimate, and was in itself a significant relief. And he confirmed my information about making installment payments. In the months since, the IRS sent me a bill for back taxes and I arranged a modest $64/month installment payment. I also subtract 15% self-employment tax.

I hadn't been there since I was a small child so it was fun to see the city.  It was an emotional experience for me as it made me realize how much I want to leave Illinois.  I would like to start a new life with my family somewhere new. Memphis, while not ideal, showed me that other areas are a lot more in tune with what I want in life.   Seeing the nightlife, the family activities and places to live showed me the whole picture. It made me sad to have to leave.  This experience has motivated me to get serious about saving money so we can move somewhere in the South.  I think that it will help our family have a better life.", "label": "recalled", "group": "MD1UFQDS"}

For years after high school, I attended college with the intent of being the first in my family to walk away with a degree. I also wanted to be involved in college, and I got so wrapped up in Greek life, I paid no attention to my physical health. I went about 3 years being a glutton and a drinker, although never becoming an alcoholic. My ties were eventually broken with my fraternity, and I went completely down south, and gained quite a bit of weight. To this day I'm trying to finish my degree, but this story is about making change and maintaining discipline. About 6 months ago I decided enough is enough, and that I want to recapture my athleticism, my original form. Now, this didn't come easy, as I knew that if I were to stray any farther, that I may never get any better. This process was no easy task, and was less about obtaining a certain weight, as with all great things come with discipline and practice. I needed to get my diet straight, and to stop binge eating, and to take multiple small meals as opposed to one big one. More than that, I need an intense training regimen that would target a fat burning heartbeat, alongside High Intensity Interval Training. It was painful. But as Eric Thomas once said, \"You're already hurt, get a reward for it.\" I fought, I fell, I got back up again, and I won. 6 months from when I first started, I have last 60 lbs and continue to lose more. My journey isn't at an end, but I have forever changed my lifestyle. I do fully intend to finish off my degree and become a teacher, and my my new endurance and overall self respect has given me newfound ambition.", "label": "recalled", "group": "6ORMSK4L"}

It isn't so much of a research and looking to beat the disease as it is to help families lead some kind of a normal life and allows children to do things like attend camps and parents to have such things that are taken for granted like \"date nights\".  I played with three of my good friends who I have known since high school.  One of my friends recently lost his dad to cancer.  I was very close to his dad and remain close to his entire family.  It was a very hard time that he went though as well as the rest of the family.  Truthfully I struggled with it as well as, although he had been fighting cancer for 20 years, the end came pretty quick.  At this tournament there was one hole that is called the dedication hole.  On this hole every person is given a new golf ball where they write the name of someone who has been effected by cancer in your life.  Without being prompted all of us put down my friends dad's name.  It was at this point that my friend and I both became very emotional.  This is a tournament that both of us have played in for a number of years, but even so I didn't foresee the level of emotions that we would have at this point.  I think that this will be something that will stick with both of us for a long time.

My wife and I laughed because it reminded us of our first date together in college. We ended up going to a frat party, where they were drinking Rainier beer. It had a drawing of Rainier on the logo. Anyway, when we arrived at the campground, we were absolutely struck by how beautiful the national park was. We were going to be hiking a very long trail the next day, so we quickly set up the tent and got our campsite squared away. My wife, who hadn't been camping very often, was a little bit skittish about the signs we had seen warning of bears. Every time a twig snapped or the wind blew our tent flaps against the tent walls, she started in fright. Eventually, we both drifted off to sleep after the long drive. The next morning, we secured our campsite and headed off to begin our 5 mile hike. We packed food and water and started up the trail. There were dark clouds in the horizon, and I commented that we might be in for rain. But my wife thought it'd be okay to continue. It never did rain and we had a wonderful hike.

I had graduated college three months before (nine months ago) and landed a steady full-time salaried job four weeks after graduation.

I was concerned that my parents would be sad that I was leaving home as we are very close and I help out with my sisters. However, I was tired of not having privacy to spend time with my long-time boyfriend. I was also bothered every night to spend time with my family after I returned home from a long day at work and just wanted to relax. It was time to spread my wings and put down new roots of my own. After looking at three apartments, I decided on a very nice remodeled building with a parking space for my car and large windows with lots of light and closet space. I signed the papers and put down the deposit, still without talking to my parents.

I waited for frowns or tears but both of them stood up and hugged me.

I obliged, and she set a pregnancy test on top of a paper towel that had been placed on the table in front of me.  It indicated that she was pregnant.  I wasn't sure how to feel.  I was excited, but nervous. This certainly was not a planned event. But regardless of how I felt, I needed to deal with it as best I could.  My take home pay was just enough to cover our existing lifestyle, and now I would have to purchase diapers, baby food, clothing, and all of the other baby-related items.  Our medical bills would increase.  It was stressful. However, I knew we could handle it, as we had before.  My job was quite flexible, and I could work more hours and bring home more pay.  My wife could work online - she was a medical transcriptionist before she quit to take care of our first child, and her company offered to keep her employed on a part-time basis if she ever needed the work.

It looked like someone was in my car. I got up to take a closer look and sure enough, two people were sitting in my car, rummaging through my belongs. Anger took over me, and without thinking, I ran downstairs to confront them. \"Hey, what the hell are you doing in my car? You know I'm a federal officer, and you just broke into my car??\" I said. One of the men replied, \"so?\" I didn't say anything else, I just turned around to walk back to my apartment so I could call the cops. As I'm coming up the stairs, my roommate is coming downstairs. She had seen everything from the bedroom window and came down to see what was going on. I rushed passed her, heading up the stairs, as I ran past her I told her they just broke into my car and I was calling the police. While I'm running up the stairs, I can hear my roommate trash talking the suspects. Telling them to get a job and things like that. I live on the third floor and by the time I got to the bottom of the third floor stairs I heard my roommate yell out \"he just tried to hit me with a bat\" I hurried as fast as I could to get to my apartment. I grabbed the closest weapon I could find, a knife, and headed back downstairs to help my roommate. I ran up to the guys with the bat and one proceeded to swing at me several times. I put my arm up as he tried to swing for my head, and he broke my arm. Eventually the suspects were arrested. I will never forget this day and how much fear and anger I felt, and still feel to this day.

This time, his breathing was so bad that he almost didn't make it to the adjoining town, which has a much larger hospital. He was sent by ambulance and it was immediately determined after arrival that both lungs were full of pneumonia. They also discovered two spots on one of his lungs. At first they did have him stabilized, but he continued to spit up blood and it got much worse over the next couple of days. The white hospital wash clothes were turned completely red. The doctors started testing him for a much worse type of pneumonia, called \"fungal pneumonia\". We never found out the results of that test because he passed away before the results came back.

My brother start to discuss his journey and why he was here. I could gather that he was homesick and was not about to miss another holiday without celebrating with his family. Young and old, I could see smiling faces and positive interactions. As the day came to a close, I was pulled aside by my brother to learn his health scare. I was sworn into secrecy. I knew there was another reason behind his visit as the holidays though approaching were still several weeks away. I was happy that he did want to be with his family at this time of sadness.

It was around 3am when I started to feel very strangely, dizzy, disoriented and scared. I woke my husband up and asked him to take me to the emergency room. Once we got there they ran many tests to find out why I was feeling the way I was. My blood sugar was very high, dangerously so. The doctor was surprised I wasn't in a diabetic coma. I was in the hospital for around 20 hours while they tried to determine if anything else was wrong with me. They were worried I might have had a stroke due to some of my symptoms. I had lots of blood work and a contract MRI done, as well as x-rays and cognitive tests. Once they were sure that I hadn't had a stroke they tried to bring my blood sugar down to a safe level. I was given multiple injections over several hours that failed to bring it down significantly. Finally it came down just barely into safe levels and they sent me home. Since that incident I have changed my life style. I've changed how I eat, started working out and running six days a week and lost forty pounds.

I looked at my phone and saw on my calendar that today was the big day I had been waiting for, after the past 4 years of responsible studying and grueling all night cram sessions. I was to receive my diploma, my B.A. in Computer Science, officially today on stage. I quickly got up, took a shower, brushed my teeth, got dressed and skipped to the kitchen to have breakfast. I lived alone, with just my dog, in a small apartment. So we enjoyed a lovely and quiet breakfast together. I later went for a walk with my best friend around the block, it helped to calm my nerves and expel the butterflies in my stomach, as well as calm down my furry friend. After our morning routine, I arranged my gown and cap, made sure to press them down, wrinkle free, and folded and packed them neatly to wear for later. I got in my car and drove to the graduation ceremony location, a large auditorium on campus that was usually reserved for putting on plays and concerts. I greeted my two best friends, Jared and Jake, and my scarce family there as well ; at the school. My family and I were a smaller than average bunch, with me being an only child and my father passing away at a early age, it was only my mom and my uncle there to cheer me on. I gave them both great big hugs and we took some pictures together with great big smiles. I left to get dressed up and ready for the ceremony. After getting dressed, we took our seats next everyone else in the large auditorium. The usual mandatory, long winded speeches were given, with our special guest speaker a famous vocalist who I cannot recall the name of, someone from American Idol I think. When the time finally came for us to walk up one by one to receive our diploma, I was a bit nervous and weary, as everyone before me had received such large applause and cheer from the crowd. With only two of my family members attending, I thought it might be a bit embarrassing to not have any sort of uproarious applause for my name being called. I got in line, and slowly proceeded to walk on stage, with our names being alphabetically announced, I was soon to be next. When my name was heard over the speakers, I was quite surprised and excited. What I thought would be a few claps, turned out to be an enthusiastic and encouraging applause of a multitude of people. I was humbled by the support and it gave me the confidence boost I needed to stride on stage and shake hands with my teachers with pride. I couldn't remove the large smile on my face for that entire day because of how nice everyone was to me and because of this moment, I will never forget the sense of exhilarated bliss that I experienced from not only the culmination of my 4 years of hard work, but the positive support of strangers, friends and family.", "label": "imagined", "group": "6OXZWVUA"}

He was only 57 and had been suffering for three and a half years. The came six months after our Dad had passed from complications due to a stroke. This summer was particularly challenging for my sister as my Dad's birthday and her anniversary was in July so she was very sad. When I called my sister on her anniversary to let her know I was thinking of her, she told me she had not even heard from our mother was very hurt by that as our mother, out of everyone, should have known how my sister was feeling that day. Whenever I would speak to my sister, she would be upset about something our mother had said to her. For example, in trying to go through paperwork, my mother would say to her, \"at least you have your girls to help, I have no one\". It's hard for me to even think our mother could be so harsh because my sister's husband died so young whereas my dad was in his 80's and had lived a great life. This insenstivity extended to our younger sister, who instead of offering her support, chose to bring up an event that happening 8 years ago at our parent's 50th anniversary. It escalated earlier this summer over text messages with some very vile things said to each other and they are no longer speaking to each other. In fact, my younger sister tried to get me to take her side when I went for a visit for her son's graduation. Thankfully, my younger sister's husband told her that she should not drag other people into her fight with my older sister. It was heartbreaking to her that our mother and younger sister are that insensitive to my older sister and what she is going through.

She came dressed in a Frozen 2 princess dress and sneakers, and looked like she was ready for action. She had just gotten some Barbie dolls for her birthday and, as an only child, had no one to play with, so I volunteered. It was incredible to see how smart she was, and how she could figure things out on her own. I hadn't seen her since last Christmas, and with so many family members around, it's a little hard to be with anyone individually. I remember her as a shy little girl who really wanted nothing to do with me, so seeing her break out of her shell this time was such a revelation and joy for me. I was incredibly impressed at how she bounced around from one activity to another, and I had trouble keeping up with her! I only made things worse by giving her a small piece of candy - one little Reese's peanut butter candy and she was hyper! Eventually, my brother showed me a way to calm her down... by letting her watch some videos on YouTube that I had no concept of, but entertained her to no end. She asked to take her shoes and socks off - so polite - and proceeded to spend the rest of her time here as a barefoot little angel. After that, we did some coloring, and played with her dolls some more. It was all too soon that her dad was telling her it was time to go home, but she didn't want to! She said she wanted to stay there and play with me... something that touched me so dearly! I was so appreciative that I was able to have such an effect on her!

He and I went for a long run to get it out of our systems.   I couldn't sleep that night, I was angry at the kids and upset for my son.  Even though he said he was ok, I knew that he wasn't and I could see the hurt and frustration in his eyes.  The next day, I called the coach and took it upon myself to report the situation.  He was surprised because everyone likes my son, and was concerned that he opted not to say anything to him about it.  The coach wound up looking at the security footage from the field for that day, and though he couldn't hear what was being said, he was able to determine who it was, and what was happening.

One got a 20-year jail sentence. The other got 5-long periods of probation. \"I think these two cases are not instances of something besides the realities. The realities and the law being applied accurately,\" Hon. Penny Wolfgang, a resigned State Supreme Court Justice, said. So why such a uniqueness between the two sentences if the wrongdoing was the equivalent? The explanation - government versus state courts. Carlique DeBerry, 40, Buffalo, was accused of \"dissemination of fentanyl causing demise\" in a government court. \"It was the medications that the individual disseminated that brought about the passing,\" U.S. Lawyer James P. Kennedy, Jr., said. That requires an obligatory least sentence of 20-years. Marla Fenner, 27, Geneva, a first-time guilty party, exchanged fentanyl for two yogurts and a squeezed apple. That individual later kicked the bucket from an overdose. The way in to her case is that she was accused of \"third-degree criminal closeout of a controlled substance\" in state court. \"Options in contrast to imprisonment especially including medications, attempting to empower treatment,\" Wolfgang said. She wasn't accused of a murder or even criminal carelessness (by implication causing somebody's passing). As per the First Assistant District Attorney Jason MacBride, under state law, demonstrating an immediate connection between somebody who overdoses and the merchant isn't simple. Actually, conveyance of a controlled substance warrants a more serious discipline than a criminally careless charge.

We thought about possible names. We settled on Dana if it was a girl and Dale if it was a boy. We realized it was quite early on, but the excitement just overtook us. This excitement would soon change to a different feeling. I was at work one afternoon about two weeks after we found out and felt sick. I was very worried, but it passed and I thought nothing of it. About one week later, the unthinkable. I went in for a routine exam with my doctor who gave us the shock of our lives. Our sweet baby's heart had stopped beating. I was devastated and in disbelief. I refused to acknowledge the news. Reality set in three weeks later when I miscarried. My doctor suggested I write my thoughts in a journal as therapy, but the emotional pain is still there.", "label": "imagined", "group": "RYN1EIYJ"}

She explained that the Drs had found a mass on her right breast and they had some concerns, she asked if i could come home for sometime and stay with her. I was frightened and we both went to the first Dr. appointments together, after the biopsy. They found out it was cancer and that is was an aggressive form. So we scheduled the surgery as soon as possible. They did the surgery and they actually messed up. she was home and violently ill we took her back and they had punctured her lung and not bothered to read the x-rays after the surgery. which to me is mal-practice. She had to get a tube put in her and another surgery. We were worried the hospital may kill her if the cancer didn't. We tried to converse with a lawyer but no one would look at it. So instead we found another Dr about 2 hours north that had a way better reputation and we went with him. That was over 5 months ago and she has gone through the worst of it. the chemo was bad and afterwards the radiation we just got done with. the good news is. She is actually in remission and doing much better. I am still home looking after her and she is happy about it and so am I. we have re- kindled our relationship and we get along very good these days. In a way I'm glad it happened, but im sorry she had to go through it. but good things came from it. things I never thought could happen. we never talked much after my dad passed away, but now we are best friends and that is a blessing unto itself.

If my blood sugar is too high, I will need to take insulin to bring it down.  Otherwise, I can get extremely sick.  If my blood sugar is too low, I need to eat food and drink with carbohydrates in order to raise my blood sugar.  If I don't treat my low blood sugar quickly, I can have a seizure which can lead to my death.  One Saturday afternoon several months ago, I began to prepare my dinner.  I was going to eat two chickens breasts and a cup of brown rice.  In order to prevent blood sugar spikes, I need to take my insulin around 30 minutes before I eat.  On this day, I took around 10 units of insulin in order to cover my rice.  The food took around 30 minutes to prepare and it smelled delicious.  I was very eager to eat try out the chicken breasts due to a new recipe I used so I ate both of the chicken breasts first.  The chicken was absolutely delicious.  However, I had become uncomfortably full.  I was full to the point where I felt like I needed to vomit.  Unfortunately, at this time my insulin was starting to kick in which dragged my blood sugars down to dangerously low levels.  Chicken doesn't have any carbohydrates in them so they wouldn't have prevented my blood sugars from dropping.  I needed to eat the rice, but I couldn't because I felt like I was going to vomit.  My strength started to go and my body started to spasm.  It was harder for me to think clearly due to my low blood sugar.  I knew I needed something light that had a lot of carbohydrates to bring up my sugar quick.  Through my haze, I remember I had Gatorade Energy Gels.  I typically used these gels when I exercise because they have a lot of carbohydrates in them.  I tore the gels out of their packets and let them sit under my tongue to dissolve.  After sitting and eating the gels, it took about 25 minutes for my blood sugar to get back up to a safe level.  I remember sitting on the floor of my living room, drenched in sweat, and feeling relief that I made it through the ordeal.", "label": "retold", "group": "4SLOQWDX"}

This particular weekend they all got together, found a board for me, and took me to the beach since the waves were not too rough on that day, and perfect for a beginner. They were all trying to explain to me what I needed to do, and then they finally made me go out into the waves and try it. The experience was amazing. I was shocked that I got up onto the board on my first attempt. I certainly did not expect that. The feeling of gliding on the wave is difficult to describe. I surfed with my friends for the better part of the morning, until I was exhausted. This was one of the most memorable experiences of my life. I will never forget the wonder I felt on the first surfing day of my life. I am hoping that surfing will now become a regular part of my life.

Cliche as it sounds and as over dramatic as I may come off as, I'd have to say it meant the world to me to finally meet somebody with a head on their shoulders and who isn't a completely horrible person. Well, let me clarify that not everyone is that, but my prior relationships in both instances were enough to turn me off of the very thought of another for a lifetime. Between mental abuse, lies, manipulation and cheating, I somehow managed to hit the jackpot back to back, in the worst of ways. I won't go into details about that, simply to save everyone the displeasure of a history lesson and a guy who couldn't see similar signs from two different people, but instead finally go into details about this next one. Through a neutral friend we ended up meeting one another and neither really had any wants or desires for a relationship. We started out as friends, we'd bullshit around and usually did things with the group. Although we both had some unique, silly tastes that the entire group hadn't enjoyed (But parts did). Anyways, as time passed and we continued to learn from one another that we enjoyed quite a bit together, we decided to do more things on a one on one basis, without so many people around. Recently though this came to a head as we finally realized what we were doing and came to talk about it. She was a veteran, with obvious problems from her time serving, along with a horrible ex-husband and failures afterwards. Obviously what she endured had been worse than mine, but it's ultimately not a competition. We shared more intimate things and our reasoning for backing off when it came to a full on commitment. It was probably there that it should have been finalized, one way or the other but instead we just thanked each other for listening, understanding and continued to do our things together. Then, finally, one night we had both finally had enough and began to moan, complain and so on about how the other couldn't make the first move, or how things were obvious and we were both being dumb. Just people complaining for the sake of it and to get it off their chests. After that we finally shut one another up and decided to go for it. That was roughly three months ago and things have been incredible. Really the first relationship I feel comfortable in and am not staying around for out of guilt or manipulation.

This even showed me different sides of of and what I could be and in this sense it is significant and I would even say life changing.  Some of the other things that I remember is playing darts with people I never met before, we had fun and I felt connected just playing this simple game. I also remember meeting a cute girl, she a blond hair and her name was Anabel, I felt like I known her for ages for some reason, maybe it was the music that made me feel nostalgic but probably it was just a dejavu. The birthdays itself lasted for two days, since it stated on the weekend and my friend could afford an even longer holiday. There were a lot of fun thing to do and the food was amazing, my favorite dish was pizza of course, it was a real Italian pizza from some high end catering service. Also the fresh sashimi was great and tasty. The music was great and the DJ did a great job adjusting to our mood and taking guest requests into consideration. So this birthday was more of a concert than a typical home birthday I am used to and expected to experience.  There were some people whom I've know since I was a kid and it was a very pleasant meeting since we haven't seen each other for ages.  At midnight there was a fireworks show and not like a small fireworks that you can buy anywhere on Halloween but an actual commercial grade fireworks which were huge and loud like it was a major holiday or something, so I really enjoyed that part since you don't see that too often in a common weekend. Since it was a two day celebration and since my friend has a big house, most guests could just stay overnight in one of the bedrooms, it made us all feel even closer and the next morning I felt even more connected to the new people I have met the previous day as well as to my old childhood friends.  Overall it was one of the best birthday celebrations in my life and I really enjoyed it and will probably remember it for a long time if not till the rest of my life.  It was his 30th birthday and I guess that's why he decided to do on such a large scale and many of us felt grateful for that, especially since we knew what a good and kind person he was and this wasn't even necessary for us to start thinking of him even better.", "label": "imagined", "group": "ZV3W27YQ"}

When we pulled up to his new apartment, I put on a smile and brave face even though I was torn to pieces on the inside. My stress levels were through the roof even as his excitement was abounding. We moved him in and he was in a hurry to rush me out the door so that he could begin his solo journey. I was totally crushed. I sobbed as I gave him a hug and told him how much I loved him and would miss him. I got back in my car and cried the whole way home. I cried for the next few days.

Just EAT!\"And that woman was crazy. Forcing yourself to eat probably works most of the time for most people. But what I was suffering from was almost ... an ANTI-eating illness. My body didn't WANT me to eat food. And that is truly weird. I should do some Internet research and find out what was going on with my system.\tAnd I still find it .... interesting, that after taking the medication I was given to make me eat, I now eat regularly with no problem. (I just wish I had better food to eat!)I wonder if my current weird eating habits now have anything to do with my previous problem? I love toast with scads of margarine spread on it. And I'm suddenly really like strawberry. Strawberry ice cream, strawberry jam, strawberry whatever. :)But just so long as I am EATING, it is much, **much** better for me, health wise, than what I was going through a few months ago.

I have quite a bit of free time since I am disabled so I thought I'd put some of it to good use. I really enjoy being around animals and they needed volunteers at the Humane Society so I thought it was a perfect fit. I had never done this before, so I wasn't sure what I was getting into but I didn't know that that particular Humane Society treats animals very well and is a no-kill shelter. So I went down there and there were five or six other volunteers there and we had to go through a brief training class about how to handle dogs. After that was over some of us stuck around and took a tour of the whole place and check out some of the animals that were there. Not only did they have dogs but they had lot of cats and kittens as well as other small pets like rabbits, guinea pigs, and even a rat. Since I was already down there, I thought I would go ahead and take a dog out for a spin. I found a really cute pitbull by the name of Dolly. Most people think that pitbulls are mean but Dolly was and anything but. She was one of the friendliest dogs I ever met. If I was able to have a dog at my apartment, I would have adopted her for sure. We went on a walk in the adjacent park and stop a couple of times to look at flocks of birds or people having a picnic or we just sat by the pond. Every time we sat down Dolly would start jumping up and licking my face all over. It took me a little bit together to stop but eventually, she did. She was very animated and it looked like she was even smiling during this whole time. I've taken plenty of other dogs out for walks but so far, Dolly has been my favorite for sure. She wasn't at the shelter very long since everybody enjoyed her company. She got adopted pretty quickly. I was sad to see her go but there were plenty of other dogs that I could take for walks and play with in the shelter's backyard.", "label": "recalled", "group": "DEH1GAZ2"}

This year we managed to convince a new friend to go with us on top of our usual group. We traveled there during the middle of the day and were lucky enough to not have to deal with any snow this year. The previous year was quite snowy when we were driving up. We also managed to get lucky and get a room with a balcony again. We try our best to get one every year but since so many people are going it's often tricky to not find them all booked already. The balcony adds a really nice relaxing place to hang out where you can still see some of the event while taking a break up at your room, it really adds to the experience. The event has a 24-hour arcade that runs every day and we have found over the years that it's best to be up and night and sleep during the day. That way you get to enjoy the arcade with less people and can sleep when everything is super crowded. This year especially I mostly focused on the arcade so I was asleep a lot during the day and just stayed up all night. You also have to be careful about where you get food and when because of how busy everything is. Typically we get a bunch of snacks and things for our room to have something as filler since we aren't sure when we might manage to eat. We also try to make at least one trip to a nearby steak place every year we go, as well as a trip to the local Chinese food place. We did our best to teach our new attending friend our tricks but we mostly let him enjoy whatever he wanted to do and he ended up liking the event a lot which is good. I believe he managed to get something signed by a composer he likes. I hope he comes again next year and we can have another addition to our yearly crew. Overall it was a great time and I look forward to going again early next year. This is so far the main thing I do reliably every year so I hope we get to keep doing it.

I have been a huge Star Wars fan for over 20 years, so going to this land was really exciting for me. When we were in the land, my husband and I were going around the land and I was completely entranced with all of the details of the land. Now my husband is not that huge of a Star Wars fan. He hasn't even seen all of the movies, but he went through the whole thing with me and supported me as I nerd-ed out. As we walked through, he started asking me more and more about what he was seeing. I was able to explain a lot of inside things that a normal fan may not have known about. He really took an interest. Eventually we made our way to the made gift shop, the Den of Antiquities. This is hands own one of the coolest gift shops I have ever seen. The gift shop is divided into two main areas: one for the Light Side and one of the Dark. In the middle of the shop are the legacy lightsabers and a bunch of artifacts from other characters that did not fall into either side. We went back to that gift shop quite a few times in our time there, trying to decide what souvenirs to bring home. On one of our last trips into the shop, my husband asked me to step outside. Knowing he was up to something, I did as he asked with no argument. When he came outside to join me he had a small black, velvet bag with him. When I opened it I found a necklace. But not just any necklace, the exact replica from the one Rose wore in Episode 8. It was so amazing!

I was told it was all in my head and to keep it and quickly released.  The cravings worsened. The cravings worsened and I relapsed on heroin.  The relapse worsened and I OD'd.  Fortunately, my boyfriend discovered me and called 911. I was taken by ambulance to the emergency room and revived.

About 3 months ago I got a raise and a promotion at my job. But today was great because I started working on my own, my training is finished and I can move forward in my new job. Before then I was feeling really down and possibly looking for a new employer. I didn't feel like I was making the progress I would like to in my job. I didn't feel noticed. I had briefly mentioned my wanting to move up the corporate letter to my boss during a review, but I didn't see a promotion coming along anytime back then. To my surprise Becky the HR coordinator called me to her office out of the blue around 3 months ago, and along with my department manager Will they discussed that I was being promoted and that my salary was going up substantially. I was shocked. I think I might have almost cried when they first brought it up to me. They told me that it would be a rather long training schedule for the new position as they wanted me to succeed in my new position. I didn't quite know what to expect. Several months later here I am leading my own team. I am confident. I am happy to come into work everyday. I am glad that I put in the effort to move forward in my career.

It's really one of the things that has drawn me to the Catholic religion-the ceremony and sacredness of every little thing that is done. I love the music. The beauty of the church is striking. Anyway, we finished our little ceremony with few mistakes. We had walked up the steps at the alter to be closer to the priest, who isn't a young man and he's slightly limited in mobility. Turned out he wasn't going to come close to us, and our sponsors were to come around from behind to face us and do part of the blessing that the priest would have done.

On our last day, we decided to try to do a nearby hike in hopes of seeing the sun set from a particularly choice location. We got a tip from a local and decided to set out in the late afternoon. As we left our cabin, a few local dogs seemed to just understand where we were heading and suddenly followed us.

They played and trotted in front of us, taking us through a dense path of beautiful trees. As they led us up the mountain, the sun began to fall.

My wife and I were actually going to work on starting a family next year, however, it seems as though the universe had other plans. I was not sure at first how to feel about it but when I heard the baby's heartbeat for the first time, we were emotionally overwhelmed with joy. Hearing the heartbeat and seeing that little flicker of light on the screen was like staring at a star in space. It was a whole new experience for me as a person and seemed to remind me of the divine forces that work in our life sometimes. This new experience in my life also triggered so many other emotions, particularly the relationship with my family. My relationship with my family has been a roller coaster throughout my life and one of the most negative aspects in my life. The addition of a new baby seems to have bright some much needed positivity within my family but there is still some hesitation on my part to embrace my family. However, I do want my child to know their family and recognize how important that is. I have to remind myself that I need not project the failures of my parents on to my child and understand that those failures do not determine the quality of parent I am looking to be. My approach and mentality will be different. The situation my child will be born in to is already better than the one I was born in to. The changing of my priorities is scary but this is now my path. My baby's life is now at the forefront of my thinking and I must do everything in my power to ensure the life of this child can excel and prosper. This is my new normal and I look forward to learning many new things about myself and the world.", "label": "recalled", "group": "YMXH3Q38"}
{"id": "3NVC2EB65RL8WVQNU8SHVHRHDFPY3X", "text": "My dad got remarried. It came as a sudden surprise as he had not told us anything about it and so me and my younger brother were shocked. The emotional wounds of losing our mother 2 years prior were still fresh and the pain had yet to fade. So when he invited us out to dinner and brought along a lady-friend, we were surprised to say the least when he announced to us that this was his fiance and that they were to be wed in a few days. Our dad was never really close to us growing up so communication was always a little awkward. We respected him and he respected us, but he was never much of a \"father\". Instead it was our mom that kept us on track, fed us, drove us to all our activities, and was there when we needed someone to talk to. I guess this is typical of an Asian family, stereotype or not. But still, he mourned just as much as me or my brother when it came to the loss of our mom and I had felt our familial ties pull taught as now we were down to just the three of us. At that time I was just graduating college and my brother was transferring between universities, so none of us were prepared to lose someone so important so early on. It felt like our lives were just beginning and we imagined our mom to be there every step of the way, to introducing our future girlfriends to eventually seeing our mom hold our future kids with the same love that they had blessed our childhood with. All of that was gone now. So him announcing his new marriage just 2 years later felt so fast and abrupt to me. I felt like we barely had any time to process my mom's death, and now I suddenly had to face another big shift in our family. Maybe it partly had to due with my dad's lack of communication, but that fault also laid with me as I had not really attempted to make any headway in understanding each other either. So I guess in hindsight it's understandable, why he chose to wait until the very last minute to announce a new family member. It didn't feel like a replacement of our mom. It just felt like a new companion for our dad, someone to keep him busy and help him move on. I still don't even refer to her as \"mom\" but as \"auntie\" and she seems to be very understanding of such. After all, how can you replace someone that loved you for 25 years of your life. My dad got an early start, and we're all starting to progress in our own lives now, but the memory of my mom lives on.", "label": "recalled", "group": "UN8IIW8C"}

I also made just enough to pay bills with a little extras spending money, and I could not afford to pay for childcare for her to work more hours.

I explained that the decision had nothing to do with them and everything to do with low teacher pay. They understood my situation completely. Teachers are underpaid and overworked.

During this training, I'm expected to complete every kick, block, punch, and form that I've learned up to this point in my training.  I also have to learn 3 step sparring, which is learning how to fight someone, and counter the move they're doing when they attack you.  In addition to this, I have to run up to 5 miles, run stairs, and other conditioning, in order to prepare for my black belt test.  This training will continue on for another 5 months or so, until I am able to obtain a certain amount of time, certain amount of days training, certain classes taken, and a certain amount of tournaments entered and competed in.  Only then will I be allowed to test for my black belt.  I've heard from black belts that the actual test will last about 6 to 8 hours.  The reason they make us train so long and so hard in order to test for black belt is they want us to be in the best shape possible when we become black belts.  I agree with this thought process.  If we need to defend ourselves using Martial Arts, we need to be ready to do whatever is necessary in order to defend ourselves.  This is one of the reasons I enjoy going to tournaments.  I want to be able to defend myself using martial arts, should it ever be necessary.  In order to prepare to the best of my ability for this scenario, I feel it's necessary to fight other competitors in tournaments to see how I react to people attempting to attack me.  In all reality, I hope I never have to learn what I've learned in martial arts in a real life scenario.  I enjoy training to keep me active, physically.  However, I feel confident that I can apply the skills I've learned, should it ever become necessary.", "label": "retold", "group": "5D33MS4O"}

I knew my friend and I were really good friends, but I had no idea he valued my friendship this much. Part of me wonders if I was selected because of my photographing skills, but I'd like to imagine it was because of our close friendship as well. The day was one of the greatest days of my life. The small venue and exclusiveness of the wedding made it feel a lot different. Much more different than any other wedding I've been to. Due to the fact my friend and their significant other did not need to spend a lot of money on extra guests, we had a very personalized experience. The food was absolutely top notch, much better than anything I've ever tasted. I got to capture photos that were much more intimate than any wedding. I got to solely focus on the immediate family and the couple, as there were not a log of guests to bog down my time. Not only did I get to take the serious and core photos of the family and couple, but I also got to take a bunch of silly ones. Though this occurred 4 months ago, I can still remember everything in perfect details. In fact, I have the pictures to prove it! The scenery chosen was beautiful, fountains and amazing flowers encompasses the backgrounds. I think my favorite part was the genuinely happy faces that everyone held the entire time. I'm not sure I've ever seen a wedding where everyone was so happy. In summary, I will always remember this wedding, not only because of the exclusiveness but how wonderful I enjoyed it on a personal and professional level.

I feel this was so important for my daughter.  She felt like she bonded with her cousins even more.  Since this event, they have been staying in touch with their phones.  They have a group chat with another one of our cousins who lives on the west coast.  It seems as if the other two cousins don't have a lot of friends either.

We wanted to keep our family together, so we all moved together, my husband, me, and our two children who are also in elementary school. I decided that for awhile I will be a stay at home mom and take care of our two boys while they are in their younger years. I think my teaching background will help with this and make it a good experience for them. I was very sad to leave my job because I love my coworkers and students. My students have always been great, and they gave me little cards that they made to wish me good luck in the future and told me that they will miss me. At the same time, I think there will be an opportunity for me in the future to become principal of a local school in our new area. I had thought about moving up like this for awhile and might have the opportunity a few years down the road. I have enrolled in a graduate program to prepare me for this next step in my journey and will be able to dedicate more time to it since I will be staying at home with the kids and will have some time during the day while they are at school. It was difficult for me to leave everything I knew and the city I grew up in to move away with my husband, but I think it will also open new doors and new opportunities for me. I have needed a little push to get me going in the direction I want to be going, and this might help me take the leap and go the next step in my career. My husband is very happy about his promotion and transfer, and I think this will end up being a promotion for me as well. My students and I all took a picture on my last day and I have it framed in our new house. It was hard and tear-filled when I had to say goodbye to my colleagues and leave the building with a box of my stuff. Most surprising to me has been that several of my students parents have reached out to me on social media, so I think that will be a nice way to keep in touch with my roots and not completely lose touch with my home town. I have become friends with one parent in particular who I always viewed as a difficult parent, but she is very well-meaning and wants the best for her children and I have a completely different view of her now that we are friends and not just seeing each other in parent-teacher meetings. It is interesting to see different sides of people and see things you didn't think you would see. The other thing that was difficult for me was that our new town is smaller than our old one and it seems a little bit more difficult to meet people but I am hoping that being in school will help with that, and I might try to start some social groups, which is something I had always thought about doing.

As I was reading the newspaper one day many years ago, I found an advertisement for a rescue dog. Intrigued, I visited the rescue dog shelter. There were many dogs, very excited to see people. There was one, however, that I really connected with. His name was Rufus, a German Shepherd. After talking to the rescue dog shelter volunteer, I applied to adopt a dog and requested Rufus. After waiting on pins and needles for a week, I finally got a call from the rescue dog shelter. Rufus was officially mine, and I can go over to pick him up! For the next 10 years, we had so many good memories. We spent a lot of time on walks, being active in the backyard, and even some of the mischief he had caused.  He had this long face any time he looked at me, but he was a very happy dog whenever we had visitors or just going about everyday life. The joy he brought into my life is immeasurable. After 10 years, he passed away from old age.  I was heartbroken. I knew the time would come, but I never wanted it to. The bond Rufus and I had will remain with me together, and I cannot wait to see him again.", "label": "imagined", "group": "E2AEJGZW"}

To me it was a memorable experience because I thought about when I moved into college 11 years ago. I remember driving down there with him and our parents and the whole process just brought back a lot of memories. It started with helping load the car with his things and carrying everything up to his dorm room. There were hundreds of students moving in and the campus yard was huge. Looking at the dorm room itself was especially nostalgic because of the double beds and the desk that looked exactly like the one I had in college. I felt like my brother was more creative with decorating than I was because he wanted to hand lights above his bed and put up nice pictures. My mother was being how she always is with making sure that everything was in order and asking him if he had everything he needed along with helping him make his bed and put away his stuff. He had this really fluffy white rug beside his bed and his bed sheets and comforter looked really comfortable. He also had a \"bed in a suitcase\" thing that I didn't have when I moved into college. I helped him hang his lights and even took a photo and kept comparing how it was for me moving into college and how my process wasn't as big due to the fact that the school I attended was smaller and there weren't as many students. It was weird leaving because he didn't seem like he would be homesick and he was ready to just start doing what he needs to do without us around. I felt really old and like I was the parent, which is why it was so weird. I even remember my mother saying that if he needs things he will have to go to the store himself, which is the first step to independence because I remember myself when I moved and needed to walk to the store. It was funny to me when he asked my mother to take him to the store to get stuff before we left and she said no because she wants him to learn to do that stuff on his own.  The whole experience was just nostalgic to me, which is why is was memorable.", "label": "recalled", "group": "2A0NWGIY"}

It happened at a week-long festivity called Sirius Rising, located on the campgrounds of Brushwood Folklore Center in Sherman, NY.  The kiss we shared happened without warning and struck a special chord in my heart as well as my mind.  The moment we kissed unfolded Thursday night, while I was waiting for a concert to start.  Earlier in the day, I attended a mystical workshop at the Sirius Rising event led by a kind middle-aged lady in a electric wheelchair.  I got to meet this lady and know a little bit about her as well as her profession during this workshop.  As I was waiting for the concert hosted by a world-famous juggler to start, I met the middle-aged lady again and she set up a seat next to me.  After we exchanged a few pleasantries, my mind went into overdrive as I noticed she was leaning in for a kiss.  The moment I noticed she was leaning in for a kiss, I did not hesitate; I immediately leaned over and gave her the most tender kiss I could possibly give her.  Instinct took over in that moment; 2 seconds seemed like 10, my thoughts no longer required any form of concentration, and I revealed my true character to her without blemish.  The kiss we shared was exciting and invigorating.  Although I had never kissed a woman before, the experience reached out to me in ways I did not think it could reach.  I never believe something as soft as a kiss could get past my hardened heart and mind, but it did in a way that was pleasent.  When our lips left, I did not feel any sort of negative emotions as we continued to talk to each other about a variety of topics that are best kept to myself.  The kiss we shared is truly unique, and because it was my first kiss, I doubt it will ever happen again, which is why I will cherish the experience forever.", "label": "recalled", "group": "DFJKOYKB"}

We start a fire for light, I teach my sons how to carve wood with their scout knives. We all thought it was a relatively safe area but then I started hearing loud pops in the distance. At first I thought it was fireworks, then I realized they were gunshots from a rifle. The area isn't meant for hunting and the only animals that would be worth hunting for here would be bears. I assume that this is the case, but my kids are scared at this point. They've seen the news regarding mass shooting and they're not as familiar with guns as I am. The shooting gets closer and the threat of both gunmen and wild animals means I have to call the rangers and alert them of the situation. I go into my jeep and grab my rifle and tell both my sons to hunker in the vehicle until they come. Luckily, it gets uneventful afterwards. The rangers come by to acknowledge our presence and tell us that there were indeed people shooting at a bear about a mile or so away.

Most of us live in Florida, so we departed from Miami and had stops in Key West, Mexico and Belize before returning home. The reason we decided to do the trip was it had been 10 years since we graduated from college and went on a graduation cruise together. While taking that first trip, we made a pact to take a cruise every decade to reconnect and have fun together. Our work and personal lives have made it hard to see one another that often, but we managed to coordinate our schedules to take this trip. I roomed with one friend on the ship, while the other four had a larger cabin that they all shared with one another. Each day, we had a different activity to do. On our two days at sea, we went to the pool and the casino during the day, while enjoying some adult beverages. While we were in Key West, we walked around the town and visited local restaurants and bars. In Mexico, we were only there for a few hours due to inclement weather, but managed to do some duty-free shopping. And while we were in Belize, we got a taxi and went to a local beach and tavern to enjoy the natural beauty of that country. During the evening, we had our own table in the ship\u2019s dining room and then would go to one of the shows that the ship had and then to a bar or club onboard. There was plenty of time for all of us to reconnect with one another, reminisce about when we were younger, and have fun. On our last night, it was hard to believe how fast the trip went and how many of us won\u2019t get to see one another for a long period of time. There were a few misty eyes, but we pledged to do this trip again in 10 years and to keep better in touch with one another in the interim. Since then, we regularly text one another and share social media posts. I have been able to grab a bite to eat with two of them recently, while they were in town for the day.

My brother asked if I was going to go over to the facility, but I said not tonight, but that I would go in the morning. I have mixed feelings about that decision. You see, my dad had been diagnosed with Parkinson's and had been moved to an assistant living facility for people with chronic mental issues when my mom was no longer able to care for him. He was pretty much in a vegetative state in that he didn't speak or move. He breathed unassisted and had to be fed, bathed and changed. I had visited him a few times at the facility and hated seeing him that way. He didn't communicate with me at all. I talked to him but had no idea if he was hearing any of it. He lay on his side in a semi-fetal position, his hands frozen in a curled, claw like posture; his face expressionless, his mouth frozen in an open position.  His eyes didn't move or follow you in any way. I secretly hoped he would pass on quietly and peacefully in his sleep, sooner rather than later. I didn't know what else to do. He wasn't going to get any better, and no one knew how long this would go on. I remember thinking how can anyone in this world think this is the way anyone would want to live? It made me think how selfish people were, because the only people who could see this as an acceptable way for another person to live would be someone not going through it, but willing to put someone else through it just so they would not have to deal with the death of a loved one. If it was possible to choose to have him euthanized, I would have done it. But that is not an option in our \"civilized\" world, so I was stuck just hoping nature would take its course, sooner rather than later. I do not regret those thoughts. I do, however, regret not having gone to the facility the night my brother called and being by my dad's side when he died.

I also tried not to rehash the moment with any of my co-workers because just reliving it gives me anxiety. I have started to look for a new job but the truth is that its a bit scary to just jump ship and I don't want to do that until the right position comes along. I need to pay the rent. I really do believe in karma and things began to slowly put themselves in place when we got a sudden and unexpected visit from one of the regional directors on Friday. I get the feeling someone in the office may have contacted the head office and reported David because it just seems like too much of a coincidence considering that, after working there for 5 years, I don't ever remember any visits without prior knowledge. As a matter of fact, David would usually stress about these visits for at least a week ahead of time. I have never met a superior that was SO insecure of himself!!...It's beyond me how he ever got to the position of Department Head in the first place. Anyway, the next thing I know, Mr. Samuel begins to call us in for one-on-one private interviews in the conference room. I wish I knew what he asked of everyone else but from me he just wanted to know about how I was getting along with the latest project, which I was happy to tell him about. Then, he totally surprised me by asking me if I was happy.... I have not been asked that by any superior EVER in all my 30 years of work experience. And then the damn burst. I stupidly let it all out...tears, snot and all. I told him everything that David had said about me and my supposed \"lack of cooperation\" and \"selfishness\" and how he pretty much implied that I would never get a promotion if he could help it. All this screamed to me at the top of his lungs in the middle of the office. I told him that in a way I could understand how I had provoked David by refusing to change project group at this late stage of the game. But I felt that I needed to defend my work and that I was tired of David switching me out at the last minute so that he could do the presentations and get credit. Lets see how this ends....", "label": "imagined", "group": "OA6VJDJY"}

The pay was okay, but it was more about finally being able to do what I love, what I spent so long trying to achieve. Unfortunately, we took budget cuts. I was the last hired, so I was the first fired. I had to accept a teaching job at a public school after getting used to my dreamy, safe, private school job. The pay is horrendous, it's almost like the government doesn't want kids to learn anything. I had to buy most of the supplies, and some of the kids are so poor, I ended up having to buy supplies for the kids to even be able to learn. Cheap backpacks and notebooks apparently add up. I thought my student loans were bad... these credit card bills as a public school teacher may kill me before I even get a chance to get a raise in 10 years. But these kids... They need me.

We were having issues and I felt that she was withdrawing from me, most noticeably, in a sexual manner.

After I played with the audio for my own liking, I realized that I was hearing a couple male voices and one female voice on a video that was designed for me only. When I asked her about it, she said I was hearing things that were not there. That is when I took a closer look at even older videos. I found one other video in which I heard a male voice. When I questioned her about it, she denied it of course. Then I went to even older videos, and I realized that she was watching something over and over and that those videos were made in advance of them being sent to me. Yes, I did \"tweak\" the speed and enhance the audio, but that did not affect the fact that I realized that she was watching a video. I discovered that she was watching the same video over and over as she performed a solo sexual act. As I became better adapted to settings that would bring out background audio and hard to see objects in a visual sense I started seeing what I was previously being distracted from seeing. I realized that the women I loved and the one I had moved to Europe for and waited for 13 months to marry after returning from Europe was not performing for me or because of me. When I looked closer, I realized that what I was seeing was her watching a video of a dog performing oral sex on her.

I was freaking out pretty hard when it dawned on me that hey, I was marrying the girl of my dreams. The way we had met was spectacular, and totally happenstance. We had both been at a Spiritual guidance gathering at a retreat in the woods, and from the moment I saw her I knew that I needed to talk to her. I approached her with a soft smile on my face and we caught eyes, and I could immediately tell that she was the one. Now here we are, two and half years later, and I'm struggling with my damn tie and sweating and just overall a nervous wreck. Like I said, I realized that this is the girl of my dream, and the way we met was just serendipitous. I waited at the altar with a lump in my throat, waiting for her beautiful face to be led down the aisle by her Father. When that moment arrived, I was starstruck, I damn near fell over due to how beautiful she actually was, I hadn't actually seen her in about three days, due to the bachelorette party, and of course the tradition of the groom not seeing the bride before this moment on their wedding day. As soon as she reached the altar, I felt all the panick in my heart dissolve. We smiled at eachother and took one anothers hands as we looked towards the priest to begin the ceremony. I couldn't wait to make her mine, to bring her into my life as my wife, and I knew she felt the same way. It was absolutely lovely, and everything I could have expected and more. The reception was a blast as well, plenty of people laughing and telling happy stories of the two of us, and wishing us an absolutely blissful life together. That being said, I think we can leave the honeymoon out of this, because that might get a little racy, even for you diary. When we arrived home from the honeymoon, and I had to return to work, it was with great disdain that I left my new bride home alone, though I knew I would be back to see her in only eight short hours. I made haste to the office to begin my day and effectively my new life. When I walked into the office, I was immediately called into my supervisors office and I thought trouble immediately, only to be relieved that there was no trouble at all. In fact, it had been a promotion waiting for me for all of my diligent work and loyalty to the company. Could this get any better? I mean, I have had some pretty damn good luck all things considered, but is it really luck? Or is it this result of my hard work, patience and determination in succeeding in this life?

I had been chosen from over 300 students to travel to the state of Maine to participate in a research study. The trip will be paid in full by my university. I was one of two students chosen at my university for this research. The choice was determined by GPA, leadership and overall ability to succeed. I am overwhelmed and grateful for this opportunity. My first few years of college were great. The next few were a bit of a mess. I fell into the party scene and neglected my studies to the point of being dropped from a major university. I moved back home and spent the following 12 months getting my life together with the help of my family. I enrolled in a different university and put all of my focus on my studies. I have worked very hard to get my GPA back up and this opportunity  has shown the dedication that I have shown towards making a good life for myself. My mentor is aware of my previous problems with college and he has shown a great deal of respect for me considering my previous problems in college. This opportunity is one that I never thought I would have, so I am extremely exited and grateful. The most positive outcome of this is the fact that the research that I will be conducting will be published in an academic journal. This means that I will have published work before graduating with my Bachelor's degree. This will be a very positive asset to have when I apply for graduate school.

She passed away only 4 months after our grandmother passed away. So her mom (my aunt) not only lost her mother but also lost her only child all within a few months. My aunt was trying her best to keep her head above water and grieve in her own time and way but she completely let grief take her over. I had been witnessing a steady decline in her mental health the past few years and her behavior getting more erratic and manic and suspected that she was self-medicating. This became clear around Christmas time this year when she was staying with our family for the holiday and she was inebriated so much that she did not realize that she had accidentally turned on the gas on the gas stove in the middle of the night. Luckily my brother smelled the gas and remedied the situation. So that incident told me that she was not doing well at all. Then a couple of months later in the spring she had a complete mental break. Which in a way was what she needed I think, as much as it pained me to see her like this. I think she finally needed to break and hit rock bottom and scare herself to realize how much she had not been dealing with her grief. We had long talks about this, she and I, and she admits that she had not actually been dealing with her grief even though she thought she was and doing it to the best of her ability. We started sharing our travels of grief and I confided in her that I had gone to grief therapy, which she knew was a huge step for me because I have been against myself (only myself) going to therapy since I was made to go to family counseling against my will when I was younger. I told her how angry I had become after losing both my grandmother and my cousin and that anger was how grief had manifested in me. I also told her that it was OK to let grief in even though it is so painful. The more you push it down the worse it will be to overcome later. She worked hard to pull herself up to a \"standing position\" and is since doing much better and has found a great community to support her and seems to be getting back on her feet.", "label": "recalled", "group": "NGXGHQ5Q"}

I said I wanted to ride in the ambulance but they told me it was against regulations. They drove off with her with her daughter following in her car. I said I'd be right there. All of a sudden it hit me that I had to to something with our puppy. I heard a voice behind me saying \"sir, sir\". I turned around and there was a woman with a young boy and she said \"we live 2 doors down and if there's anything we can do to help, just let us know.\" I explained to her a little of what was happening and asked if there was any way she could watch our puppy. I didn't know what time I'd be coming home from the hospital. She said they would be happy to, not to worry and they would take care of the puppy for as long as I needed. I gave her the keys to my house and thanked her profusely. As it turned out they took care of our sweet little girl for 5 days.", "label": "retold", "group": "WEHFU040"}

Several months ago my brother passed away.  Since that time I have been searching my soul.  I have felt the need to get my life in order.  I had two or three unresolved issues in my life and I have felt the need to resolve those issues.  Resolving those issues has been a struggle for me, but while on this journey, I have felt and experienced God's amazing love and grace through it all.  I started by taking an intense Bible study that lasted ten weeks.  I have spent time in prayer, pouring my heart out to God.  I have learned that my past mistakes, hurts, and pain does not define who I am, but my life in Christ defines who I am.  While studying the Bible, I have found so many verses about God's unfailing love, His truths and promises, forgiveness, and strongholds that Satan has reminded me of for too many years.  I started writing these verses in a small notebook and when I am having a bad day, I can quickly find what I want. I have learned to forgive and let certain people know that I have forgiven them, and I have learned to ask for forgiveness for things I have done. I am on my way to freedom! Sometimes freedom it is not an instantaneous thing, but a work in progress.  To find it, I must study God's word and apply His truths to my life every day.  God's love and grace is so amazing.  I am glad he did not give up on me! Recently I have been able to share my story with a couple of good friends.  One of them gave me a small card the other day.  One side of the card said something about faith is like a tiny mustard seed that can move mountains.  The other side said \"I have been assigned this mountain to show others it can be done.\"", "label": "recalled", "group": "0Y5LK9WP"}

All white Americans are the descendants of people who immigrated, most over 100 years ago. I like how Andrew Yang wants to give a \"freedom dividend.\" This means that every American over 18 will get $1,000 a month \"no strings attached.\" Personally I think that with automation and AI (Artificial Intelligence) in the future there are not going to be enough jobs for people. \"If you brought it a trucker brought it.\" It is safe to say that soon cars and trucks are going to be self driving. Within a decade your food order and a fast food restaurant will most likely be prepared by a robot. The self checkout lines at Target and Walmart are just the start, pretty robots will be stocking the shelves and running the warehouse. Yes, some high paying tech IT and engineering jobs will be created, but not enough to off set the loss of jobs. However, I LOVE robotics and AI (Artificial Intelligence). Just think of all of the accidents that self driving cars will prevent. Wouldn't it be awesome to relax  on your way to work and let the car drive itself? I favor and agree and lot with moderate Republicans. However, I think that Trump realizes that in the future there will not be enough jobs for the working and middles classes due to AI (Artificial Intelligence). He wants to avoid a situation where Universal Basic Income would need to be implemented. My theory is that he wants to get rid of all of the immigrant workers. He then will install tough work standards for people to get public assistance (Welfare/Food Stamps). Who would pay for Universal Basic Income, $1,000 a month for every American over 18? You need a thousand million to make a billion. To just crack the top 1% for a given year for a couple filling jointly or a single person looking at total income (wages, capital gains, and inheritances) you would need about $469,000 annually. If you are working and middle class please consider Andrew Yang the son of Korean Immigrants for President. You will get $1,000 per month starting at age 18.

The park has a stream running through it which has a rock bottom. Kids are able to gradually hike up or down stream through the park and view several smaller waterfalls. It was a bit challenging to keep track of our two oldest sons (ages 1 and 4 at the time) because my wife was responsible for carrying our newborn. We had a chance to take several pictures of the boys playing in the water and enjoying their time at the park.

When our son, Jackson, started preschool, notes and telephone calls from his teachers regarding his inattentiveness began almost immediately.  He had difficulty sitting still during circle time and couldn't keep his hands and feet to himself.  He often started an activity, scribbled something on a piece of paper, and then would walk off to begin another activity. He couldn't concentrate long enough to finish his work.  This pattern of behavior followed him to elementary school where the classes were larger and the interruptions and misbehavior had bigger implications.  My husband and I had always recognized that Jackson had difficulties keeping himself occupied at home.  We eventually stopped attending church because his disruptiveness during the service was embarrassing. He'd crawl under the pews, roll around on the floor, and would often yawn loudly during sermons.  Despite our best efforts to discipline him, set boundaries, and accommodate his misbehavior, we felt like we were failing him.  Eventually, when he turned seven, we took him to his pediatrician, and she immediately diagnosed him with ADHD.  We felt a sense of relief that we had professional confirmation.  That was four months ago, and my husband and I are still grappling with both his diagnosis and whether or not to medicate him.  I've talked with several friends and family members who either have ADHD themselves or parent a child with the disorder.  The parents almost unanimously sing the praises of medication, claiming that the positive effects completely outweigh the negative effects such as lack of appetite.  However, the feedback from those who have ADHD and have taken medication has been somewhat of a mixed bag.  Some have told us about the depression that seems to appear once the medication regime has begun.  Others claim that lack of appetite is by far the worst side effect.  They all have conceded that they are more focused, able to complete work or activities, and feel like they are able to fit in with peers during events.  My husband and I remain undecided as to whether or not we want Jackson to take medication that might help him succeed in school, but would come at a price.

I felt like a member of the family with them more than I'd ever felt with my own and it really contrasted with the past few years. Afterwards, we headed home and collapsed at around 9pm, her due to sickness and me due to the stress of the season. When we got up, she was hardly in any state to do anything and we, as mentioned above, just had a day for us. I cooked us some macaroni and cheese, we opened presents and watched Christmas movies. It was a nice time for us. We spent the next week playing catch up and seeing all her family that we were supposed to see on Christmas.", "label": "retold", "group": "248D3HYK"}

A few weeks prior to the trip, I went to the jeweler that I had been ring shopping at for months and purchased the ring. I made sure that I kept it in the box but also inside another small container so she would never suspect it. I placed it inside one of my bags that I was bringing with me to the beach so I would not forget it. We were at the beach for a few days and when we were walking on the beach at sunset, I decided to propose right then and there. I got down on one knee on the sand and asked her if she would be my wife. She thankfully said yes, and at that moment I was the happiest person on the planet. It was also kind of funny because I recall not seeing anyone too close to us, but after she said yes I heard a couple people start clapping in the distance. I remember it being one of, if not the most, nerve wracking and scary moments of my life. I knew that she would say yes, but at the same time it still made me incredibly nervous.

It helped us have some romantic time we needed, and a way to try to reconnect. After our walks, we would go sit on the quiet and breezy beach in the beach chairs. We would chat, and almost just seemed it was just us alone there. We also took this time to become closer as a family. We would go do family activities on the days that we didn't go to the beach for the day, or in the afternoons. We had bowled one day, and played games at the arcade. This made my husband and I feel a bit more youthful and carefree. This was good for our overall emotional and mental health, but also feel a bit closer.

Not to mention the cost of living in general was so much more in California as well. It was also difficult because all of my friends and family were in New Jersey. Although there were a few musicians I was friends with, it would be almost like starting over completely since I wouldn't have my close friends anymore. However, I knew I had to try because there was so much more opportunities in LA. The music scene was much bigger in LA and there are a lot more venues that I could be booked at. My band had similar concerns but everyone except our lead guitar player, Bob, was down to go. Rob, our lead singer, didn't really have any doubts but our drummer John was difficult to convince. Anyways, we eventually got to him and decided to drive all the way from New Jersey to LA in our minivan. It was not a fun experience as everything was cramped because we had to squeeze in all of our gear. When we got to LA, everything seemed fine for the first few months. Our manager already booked us at a few venues prior to getting there and all we had to do was find a replacement for Bob. That seemed easy. Or so we thought. As we auditioned dozens of people, we quickly realized the mistake we made. The chemistry and energy Bob brought to our band was almost irreplaceable. He was an amazing backup singer and lead guitarist and none of the people we tried out came close to his level. We hastily chose someone else because we had a couple of shows coming up in a week. It wasn't a surprise that it turned out to be a disaster and we weren't booked for any more shows after that.", "label": "imagined", "group": "8MVCKPFA"}

They are an older band (from the 80s) and every time they tour, they never quite make it to my area, so I was quite excited to see them! Unfortunately, I had to go alone, so the build-up to the show was kind of dull/anxiety laced, as I had no one to talk to until they played the show. I was a bit irritated since initially my boyfriend said he would go with me, but ultimately admitted that he didn't want to go due to not really enjoying the kind of music this band plays. I was frustrated because while I didn't want him to go and have a bad time, I also didn't want to be completely alone in a room where everyone has someone else to talk to and be with. I tried my best to get over the feeling of being notable alone as I made my way to the event and stepped inside. As I try to do when I really like a band, I finagled my way as close as I could to the front of the stage, where I eventually got to the very front and held on to the barricade for dear life! The crowd all pushed forward and I watched so many grown adults like myself get way too close to one another, sweating and spewing out face paced lyrics like we wrote them ourselves. It was such a happy experience for me, the connection of strangers through music that we all really love. The bad interacted with the crowd as well and that is always a great thing to be a part of! By the end of the concert, I was very sweaty, dehydrated, my makeup was smeared and my hair was highly questionable. I felt similar to how I felt so long ago as a teenager...Alive, a part of something. Together with others, unified by something greater than us as individuals. A sort of familiarity despite not actually knowing one another.

My parents and brothers look excited and happy, although my mom is a little fidgety with eating the sushi. My mom has always been a little squemish when it came to unfamiliar food, however she seemed to be a good sport today. We all laugh and have a good time as our food arrive, and we all seem to really enjoy it. My mom was surprised with how much she liked the sushi in general, and raved about wanting to get it more often. My little brother accidentally ate some of the wassabi sauce by itself to taste it, which provided a great laugh for all of us at the table. Following the restaurant, we all head home to enjoy some cake my mom had made that night and just hang and play games.

The wedding took place at sunset on the shore of a lake in the Dallas/Fort Worth area and I had the privilege of walking my aunt, the brides mother, down the aisle. While I enjoyed spending time with my family I found it especially difficult to interact with anyone else in attendance. I can't say for sure why I struggle so much with events that are meant to be joyous, I only know that I have a difficult time allowing myself to feel happiness in conjunction with the happiness of others. For whatever reason, past sadnesses tend to bubble to the surface at these types of events. I think I've been to a few too many funerals. I was especially triggered by the father daughter dance, because the specific structure was inspired by the dance my sister and father did at her wedding. Neither my father or mother are alive anymore, so to relive that experience in a different setting was somewhat surreal and upsetting. I had to leave the venue to smoke a cigarette and collect myself. I know it's petty, but I kind of don't appreciate how my uncle co-opted this specific dance structure for both his daughter's weddings. I don't feel like he has proper ownership of it, and it's cheap and derivative. I don't like that I feel that bitter about something that is supposed to be joyous.

I've also seen the numerous depictions in film of McMurtry's stories. I first discovered the adventures of Call and McCrae in my freshman year of high school. My new girlfriend at the time (who considered herself a bit of a cowgirl) was obsessed with the series. She wasn't exaggerating to say she'd tried her hand at being a cowboy; she once joined an old fashioned cattle drive that took a herd of livestock from idaho to montana by horse. She was so taken by the series and it's characters that she even had her bicep tattooed with a full half-sleeve of McCrae rearing back on a horse. It was quite good work and I was quite jealous. I wouldn't mind going back to visit some of the timeless characters in those novels, they really do hold up in their unflinching depiction of the old american west, blemishes and all. Some of the most profound things I took from the stories were the details surrounding the cultures of the various native american tribes the cowboys encounter along the journeys. It's very interesting to know how the comanches and apaches were so desperately feared, and some other tribes simply were not as their way of life was much different. It also doesn't surprise me that plains native americans would be so tough and willing to fight to defend themselves given the overall harsh environment of north and west texas. One of the most striking moments in the series is when the long time adversary of Call and McCrae, the former chief of the comanches, is on his death-bed and seeks a personal journey to die alone and apart from his tribe. The cowboys have fought him for decades and want nothing but vengeance but they never get it. Instead the reader is treated to a profound moment of acceptance from an incredibly strong-willed man as he ushers himself from his world. It is truly one of my favorite books and having grown up in Texas, I some sense of pride imagining that events as romantic if at time brutal  probably took place. It makes me feel at the very least that Texas is as unique a state as we Texans would like to believe and often proclaim.", "label": "imagined", "group": "NR4O42LU"}

My mother and father parted ways when I was just 4 years old, and I lived with my mom and two older brothers. I rarely saw my father, although he was still a part of my life and made me try different sports or went bicycling with me. I rarely dwell in the past and sometimes my distant memories even seem to be from another person\u2019s life. I have changed so much over the years that I often wonder what kind of magic lead me to this current place. I am so used to my new self that sometimes I can\u2019t even explain my transformation. Everything has become so natural that if someone asked me how can I be so happy or peaceful, then it\u2019s possible that I wouldn\u2019t know the answer. Happiness just seems to be the natural state for humans. Why should I be miserable? However, that kind of attitude would\u2019ve been a complete utopia many years back, because I felt like the most unfortunate person alive. When i was 9 years old, waiting for one of my best friend\u2019s birthday party after 3rd grade school ceremony. I was also invited to my grandmother\u2019s birthday by my family, but I chose to stay home and go to my friend\u2019s place instead. But before that I went to a nearby shop to buy some snacks. There I met a few friends, who wished for some excitement. I still had about 2 hours until the birthday party so I decided to join them. There was an abandoned and fenceless construction site near my home, which was our typical playground. We had gone there dozens of times before to play games or have a picnic. On that day the four of us decided to play hide and seek, so we split into two teams. We crawled through the hollow spaces of long blocks of concrete, made silent movements and scouted around the place, sometimes lifting our heads up to see where the other boys were located. I felt very excited like normally. Nothing seemed to be different. But suddenly\u2026 after my teammate had finished scouting, he jumped off a concrete block which was insecurely supported by another. The jump caused the block to lose its balance while I was directly in front of it. As soon as I realized that, I was already on the ground face down, noticing only some dust flying around.", "label": "recalled", "group": "YSN7NXJU"}

I wake up and notice I have a missed text from my roommate saying something to the effect of \"lol who's the drunk snoring guy?\" I honestly think nothing of this because we live nearby both a homeless camp and an Eagle's Club, so we're used to people roaming our streets at night doing crazy shit. I get out of bed and go downstairs to complete these chores when I notice a pair of feet/shoes hanging off our couch. My stomach sinks as I remember the text I just read. I peak around the corner and see a drunk snoring stranger asleep on the couch. I wonder for a split second if the guy is maybe the maintenance man that's supposed to fix our shower and wonder if after a night out drinking he came over to our house early and decided to nap. I run upstairs, lock my cat in my room, and wake my roommate up. I tell her I don't know the drunk snoring man either and she looks just as scared as me. She gets up out of bed, grabs an empty bottle of wine and we walk back downstairs. My roommate either pokes the guy or says \"hey\" in his face to wake him up and asks him who he is and why he's in our apartment. The guy looks really confused and then really embarrassed and he tells us he got the wrong house. He tells us that he climbed into our window in the middle of the night but meant to climb into his friend's window in the apartment behind us. He also tells us this is not his first time doing this and he previously did this with the cat lady next door's house. My roommate offers him water and makes fun of him a little bit for how bad he smells like alcohol, but we both laugh and tell him it's no big deal.", "label": "retold", "group": "O1N0838H"}

I had just broken up wtih my long-time boyfriend (who I was in a long-distance romance with for the last year of our relationship) and the breaking up was not of my doing. At that point in time, I was prepared to move back to his state (California) and we were to get married.  He decided he no longer wanted that even though he still loved me.  So, here I was, in the Midwest, just having quit my job and thinking, \"now what\"?  I fell into a deep depression that was only quashed by some one-on-one therapy sessions (and after that didn't work), a visit to a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with clinical depression.  At that time, anti-depressants weren't all that available but I was prescribed one and took it for 6 months.  A horrible situation in my life but I got better and moved on.  Although I moved on, when describing my inner self to a friend, I say that something in me died.  I'm fine; I laugh; I enjoy a good time with friends, but there's a part of me that died with that experience and I have never gotten it to come back to life.  I feel that I am an \"almost whole\" person but not quite complete as a result of that time in my life.  I don't wish it on anybody.  I can completely empathize with the summary above.  I know what it is like to experience depression.  It is a horrible place to be in, mentally.  But the good news is that there is help, even for those who fall into the deep pit of despair, as I did.  One of the worst parts for me was that I saw how it affected those around me.  I was staying with my Mom for a while during this time, and she would cry (in private but I knew that she was crying because of me.    It hurt her to her core that I was going through this.

He was surprised but sounded really happy about it. I took my family to his place and we sat in silence for a little while. His new wife was the woman he cheated on my mom with and was the reason that they got a divorce. She took my kids outside and they played. I told my dad that I was there to figure out why he did it. I needed answers so I could forgive and move on from this. He explained everything. After sitting and crying for a while with him about how much of the past few years we have missed from each other, we hugged and patched things up. My kids came running in and talking about catching frogs with my dad's wife and how much fun it was. My wife took to my dad's wife as well.

At this point I felt an extreme amount of shame and embarrassment because I knew from day 1 I shouldn't have done this.  I was forced to go home and tell my family that I had been fired.

When we first got there, we enjoyed a bit of wine and some great appetizers that my sister in law had made.  She always has the nicest \"spread\".  Then we went on with our day to go wine tasting.  We went to a small town named Woodinville.  Woodinville is a quaint little town that is known in Washington for wine tasting.  The drive was beautiful.  Summer in Washington is such a lovely time compared to the hideous rain!!!!  The first winery we went to was where we tried a wine called mead. It is a wine made with honey.  It was too sweet for me.  We went to a few other wineries and settled down at one that we thought we'd enjoy.  We all sat outside at a table covered by an umbrella.  Our server brought us a selection of different wines.  We fully enjoyed them as well as the conversation.  It's so fun to get together and talk about our lives.  I remember that after that we were getting hungry, so decided to go back to Bellevue to eat.  We located an Italian restaurant that looked inviting.

She started crying and asking for my forgiveness. While continuing crying, she apologized for all of the things that she did to me. I was starting to get embarrassed as other people were looking over at our table. Awhile ago I had said that I would never forgive her for the constant insults and verbal abuse that she hurled at me over the years. But in that moment, I saw the sincerity and remorse in her eyes.

This was a very difficult time in my life, as we had been together for about nine years, she was a step mom to my two children, who adored her very much. My daughter, whose in her teens, had a very close relationship with her. I tried for months, to get her to work things out, but nothing that I tried or did, worked. I felt hopeless, utterly broken. I later found out, that the last year of our relationship she was seeing someone, and it further drove me into a downward spiral. But as they say, time heals all things. A few months ago, my ex reached out to me out of the blue. We had spoken before, briefly, but nothing of substance. Her texts through me for a loop, and for a moment, I felt like my prayers had been answered. She told me how she had missed me, my family, and thought about us a lot. After an exchange of texts for a few days, we met up, and it was the first time since our divorce, that I had seen her and it was like I was seeing her for the first time all over again. I told her how I felt about things, after finding everything out, how much it hurt, but also, that I still cared for her and there is nothing that could hold me back from wanting to give us another try. I thought things were looking up, I felt great. We went out on a few dates and things felt good. However, she was moving about an hour away, taking a new job and buying a house. I told her again, how I felt about her and she told me she wasn't in the same place. Ultimately, this hurt me quite a bit, and I felt like I was right back to where I was. Why did she text me to begin with? Did she want to know that I'd still be here? Things stopped after that, and we exchanged texts only occasionally, until she moved. I told her good luck with everything and to let me know if she ever needed anything. In those moments, I felt like we could be working towards something great, only to be left yet again, by the same person.

It seems that cousin Deena is now a full-fledged member of an actual cult. I NEVER would have seen this coming when I was just an innocent kid who used to go Down South each summer and stay with her over other nearby relatives because she was so kind to me. Although it's been decades, I remember her taking me to the movies (thanks for introducing me to Burt Reynolds and making \"Smokey and the Bandit\" one of my all-time nostalgia faves), amusement parks (NOTE: avoid falling down in a pit of animal poo when at the zoo) and our annual family reunion barbecue. This was before her child was born, so it was just me and her for the most part when we weren't out and about. Those were the days -- miss 'em indeed. Now her child is grown and she looks like an anorexic, bug-eyed, stressed-out version of her old dour, well-fed self. She has literally lost dozens of pounds and is so skinny, the entire family is afraid severe weight loss will end her before any other medical problem can. I first found out about the cult she joined from relatives who, unlike me, talk to her fairly regularly. We went to see her in person this summer because of increasing concerns about her state of mind, and were we in for a shock. Her formerly well-kept home, which she has owned for years, was a complete mess, like a hurricane flew through it several times over. SHE was a complete mess, too. It was so sad to see her but not recognize the random ramblings about her new group of \"friends.\" Unfortunately, we did not get to meet any of them, so there were no confrontations with the people dragging her down. Our only hope is that eventually we will be able to stage a successful intervention to help her reclaim her life.

I was on the way back, and I noticed a car driving slowly next to me, and I heard a couple of sharp cracks, and I was startled, I thought maybe a tree had fallen or something. Very quickly I noticed a sharp pain in my back, and while this was going on,  I noticed one of the people in the car was leaning out the window staring at me. I saw her ugly brown face staring at me, and saw she was holding something. As it turned out, it was a paintball gun, and was still shooting at me. This 'disadvantaged' ethnic minority type had just injured me, but not badly enough, she wanted to shoot me in the face or something, so maybe I'd fall off my bike and get hurt real bad, as some form of liberal social justice. Well, I stopped my bike, and reached into my fanny pack to my own gun, a real one, and they quickly sped up their car and drove away. I considered taking a shot at them, but I realized it was unlikely I'd hit them, and so I decided against it. I was in a decent amount of pain by this point, but I decided to take a detour to the liquor store instead of going straight home, picked up a 6 pack of beer, and had the people at the store tell me how much paint and crap were on my shirt, and backpack.  As it turned out, my backpack had absorbed most of the shots, so it was the article of clothing that was most paint-soaked. I got my beer, and painfully cycled home. When I arrived I took off my backpack, and shirt, and observed the injury in the mirror, it was like there was a golf ball sized dent in one of the large muscles of my back, and a nice fist sized red mark surrounding it. I put some ice on the injury, drank my beer, and tried to sleep, though it really hurt. Since then, I've been more cautious about passing cars, and bystanders in general, and I've practiced getting out my gun more quickly in case something like this happens again. I've also thought about it a lot, if someone assaults me in a similar way in the future, am I prepared to respond to them with lethal force? The answer to that is yes, I only suffered a minor injury but if things had happened a bit differently I could have been hurt very badly, and it's only right, that surrounded by people who will hurt me badly for no reason at all, other than some vague ethnic/identity/liberal ideology, I have to be prepared to hurt them first, to protect myself, at all times.", "label": "recalled", "group": "GRO4FBEJ"}

And even once I realized that the level of the competition was not impossibly high for me, I still did not focus on winning, but rather on doing the best I could. And I think that's what made winning it such a great learning experience for me: that you don't need to be obsessed with victory, but rather give it your best. It was very comforting to realize that. You see so many people who crave victory at all costs and who are so competitive, that it sometimes obscures the meaning of accomplishment and success. After the competition I felt so secure and confident. And not mostly because I had won, but rather because it validated that hard work and dedication were the way to go. And it's something I'm good at - I work a lot when I want to get better at something. It kind of makes me feel grounded and I like it.

Some parents usually just tries to mingle and drink when it comes to spending time on a kids party, but me, I love kids birthday parties. I observe how the kids party was planned and I was definitely impressed with the party I attended. I saw a lot of fun games being prepared, so I asked or suggested to my friend if we could held a fun game kids usually play but let adults get to play it. She of course accepted my request because she is one of the fun friends I have like me. So we invited all the parents willing to join the sack race. It was just not a typical sack race, we put more layers to it. It was a sack race in which everyone should wear a blindfold and at the same time spell out words every time they jump. I was the one who planned the game, and obviously I was the one who won the game. They said I cheated because I was the one who formulated the game, but honestly they were just joking around and was very happy and had fun with the game. Instead of just talking and gossiping and drinking, I created something fun for people to join into. I was definitely proud of myself and I self commended my work that day, I just want people to have fun honestly.", "label": "recalled", "group": "I36DMRSZ"}

I had planned to move in with my beau who had just left the area to return home. I met friends who shared similar situations with me, many unsure of how & if their lives would ever change: many who were judged by the townspeople they encountered. Beautiful people with all the potential in the world; although it may not seem that way. One day, a few of these friends were on their way to an Indian Reservation somewhere in the desert states. They asked if I wanted to join, and although I wanted to, I instead called my beau and inquired if he would like a visit. He told me that I could just stop by and stay until I built myself up. I was incredibly grateful to finally be leaving this situation, although I still miss the friends I had made. I plan to make a trip up there soon, and hope to see them living their best lives possible. I worry about them, but know they have a great group to make sure everyone's alright. I hope that anyone in similar places in life knows that it is only temporary and hope that the world works together to ensure that no one is without their own shelter: where they feel comfortable and can exist as they like. Judging those going through difficult times is counterproductive and only induces hate.

I had been having abdominal pain for years and was told by three different doctors that I just had scar tissue from a previous surgery and it would probably get better. Needless to say,  it only got worse.  I had to go for surgery for an infection in my abdominal wall which ended up being not infection, just inflammation from the endometriosis.  They did a biopsy of a \"mass\" as the doctor called it, which ended up being endometriosis.  With this new diagnosis, I then knew why I have been unable to have kids and that was for sure the reason I hurt almost constantly for the past several years. Finally in May I was able to start the fertility treatments. I was so excited and overwhelmed. That now give me the hope that one day I will possibly be having my own little baby.  It has been a trying time and for sure a very emotional one. The hormones make me feel, at times, that I am going to go crazy,  but in the long run I know it will be well worth the wait. I have an enormous support system. My doctors, friends, family and my boyfriend have been by my side the whole time since I have started with the fertility specialists.  The pills I take are usually not that bad on me,  however the shot that I have to take is what really gets me.  I have to stick myself in the belly with a NEEDLE!! I never saw myself being able to do that. The shot leaves a small red spot around where I take it and it is a little sore for several days. We have already finished three rounds of the medication and shots only.  I think we are going to try and start IUI/IVF in the next few months to give us a greater chance of having a baby.

However, my story was about realizing that in my relationship when I wanted to think none of it was my fault I realized that some of it is, and that you really have to be committed to view the other person's perspective. It doesn't mean you have to agree, but you should always be learning. The most surprising thing was when I learned that my SO felt a certain way that I would have never thought of, and suddenly a lot became clear. I always thought of myself as pretty emotionally intelligent, but when I learned I was wrong it really opened some doors to more thinking. The only thing this really means to me is again, it's important to keep learning and keep having and open mind and keep trying to better yourself. It doesn't mean things will work out. It doesn't mean everything will be OK. But it will probably be better for the person trying to grow, even if you end up broken-hearted in the end. There's not much you can do about that.

Because of my extreme obesity and sedentary lifestyle, I was putting a lot of strain on my heart and developed many ailments due to my condition and the shape that I was in. The most distressing was my diagnosis of congestive heart failure. My heart was not functioning problem because of the huge amount of weight that I was carrying. I also suffered from hypertensive, sleep apnea, irregular heart beat and chronic muscle and joint pain. I was extremely depressed and receiving this diagnosis made matters even worse. My cardiologist informed me that my heart was on the brink of completely giving out and I was put on blood thinners to help protect me from stokes and blood clots. Because of the blood thinners, weight loss surgery was risky and not recommended. To top things off, I had a sluggish thyroid which meant that my metabolism was not working effectively either, making weight loss almost impossible. My only option was to hold on to my faith in God and push past the barriers before me. The first thing that I did was change my eating habits. I chose a complete lifestyle change, one that I could live with for the rest of my life. I avoided high carb foods and sugary sweets and instead ate plenty of fruit and vegetables. I did internet research looking for healthy choices that would help me achieve my goals. I chose low carbs as opposed to no carbs because I knew this was a lifestyle change. I also ate plenty of protein, starting each day off with eggs and turkey breakfast sausages. I had healthy salads for lunch with a bowl of delicious homemade soup, packed with ingredients that helped boost my metabolism naturally. Dinner was lean protein, healthy vegetables, a huge salad and fresh fruit for dessert. I notices rapid results and soon I was able to begin walking.

I wish that more family could have come to share the day with us but it was special and will be something t beat when we get our vows renewed in the future. When I was younger I did imagine me to at least have a nice white dress and a bridesmaid in a church. The fact that it wasnt in a church did bother me a little, and i wore a regular but nice red dress i got on sale for $40. I would have loved to have flowers because my husband always brings me red roses. Being that it was in between our birthdays will be nice for a anniversary. I am thankful that my kids where there. I am thankful that my grandparents where present. I am thankful to be able to legally marry my husband. And I am thankful that it was a nice day.

Last year we just lost our grandmother because of her hitting her head on the floor. My grandma cared for me and my siblings when we were little. I was very young to remember but my parents used to tell me a lot of memories my grandma used to do when she was alive. The doctors said that my amniotic fluid was more than average. And I remember being too worried prior to my daughter's delivery. I had to get induced into pregnancy because it was taking too long. My husband and my siblings were there in the hospital with me. But I also felt that grandma was there with me making sure I was okay. During labor I was very pale and I feel like I was going to lose my daughter. It was excruciatingly painful but I wasn't concerned about me, I was concerned about my daughter's life. I was panicking but I felt my grandmother's presence in the operating room. It's almost as if she's whispering to me, \"I'm here, granddaughter. Take a deep breath and it will be okay.\" And it turned out to be okay. My daughter is now four years old and she's very intelligent and very curious about the modern world. She's way too young to be curious about the things going on around her that I am afraid she might grow up and learn about the evils in the world very early.

Approximately three months ago, my company was having an outing for its employees as a way to reward them for their hard work. They provided tickets for us to go to a baseball game. We could bring one person with us. Naturally, I decided to bring my boyfriend. I had never been to a baseball game before and this sounded like a fun thing to do, so I was really looking forward to it. My boyfriend and I sat close to the stadium, I had a hot dog in one hand a drink in another and I was chewing on the hot dog when suddenly, I noticed my face on a big screen above the stadium. Someone called my name. My boyfriend held my hand and led me to the courtyard, got down on one knee and as I held my breath and tried not to cry, he proposed to me while holding out the most precious, blue sapphire ring I'd ever seen. The entire experience felt surreal and he took my breath away at that moment. I had always seen these things happening to other people on TV, but never in a million years did I expect something this grand to happen to me, as much as I wanted it to. He mumbled a few romantic words and I could tell he was nervous. I was smiling. I was trying hard not to cry. I didn't want to ruin the moment for him. I heard him say he wanted to spend the rest of his life with me. He called me his best friend. His true souls mate. It couldn't get any more romantic than that. then he popped the question. Naturally, I said yes! My co-workers cheered. I started crying as he slipped the ring on my finger.

Its like those scenarios you build up in your mind where you could imagine the worst possible thing happening to you and then it does.

I felt celebrated in the most perfect way and that was being surrounded by all the people that I love and cherish. One thing that surprised me the most  is that my family was able to keep it a secret from me for so long. They are usually bad at keeping secrets and the fact that they managed to do so was impressive. Plus the day got even better when I received a personalized gift that would be the physical memory of the day. It was a day that I will keep with me and tell to my children at one point.

My family and my friends were all there to congratulate me on this achievement.  I promised my fiance and my newly born daughter hailey that her dad would finish and not quit like in the past. I wanted to show her how much hard work and time goes into making a difference in your life and i wanted to make them both proud. I want to be the best father and for her to have a good role model that shows that when things get tough you dont just quit. As i walked across that staged and got my diploma it was surreal. It felt like that moment would never come,all the long nights and hard classes have came to this conclusion and i did it. My parents took us out to eat after to celebrate. Im older than my brother yet he graduated college first because i skipped a few years. Life doesn't always go as planned and it doesn't always go the same for everyone but you do your best thats all you can ask yourself.

I know this because I keep a close watch on what I spend and document everything. Anyways, I'm actually surprised that he admitted to me that he took the money for drugs and that he's very sorry. He also agreed to do house work that I had been needing to do in order to compensate me for what he took. I'm upset with him, and slightly shocked that he would steal from me for drug money. But he really seems to be remorseful for it, and the fact that he didn't deny it when asked, and also agreed to go to meetings and reach out to people for help, and then has been actually going to those meetings for the past few weeks makes me hopeful for him. I try really hard to be supportive of him. He also opened up to me about the events that led up to the relapse. He lost his long time girlfriend of 4 years. Also, around the same time he was let go from his job because of an argument with management. He felt like he had nothing left is what he told me. I responded by saying I would help him look for jobs, if he agreed to get sober. So far, so good.", "label": "imagined", "group": "Z0V7A96G"}

It seems like ages since I've been able to write anything but it's only been a few short months since the surgery to remove my spleen. Through it all I have the love of my life, my darling Charlene, to thank for her care and understanding. If you've never experienced what I have you probably won't understand but she was there when it happened, she was the one who insisted that I go to the hospital and it was her who cared enough to stay by my side night after night when things took a turn for the worse. It wasn't the surgery that laid me up but the complications caused by a negligent hospital staff and it was Charlene who rode their tails and saw to it that I received the follow up care I needed when things went side ways. So there I was, sitting on the sofa with my girl. We watching a movie on Netflix. I felt a stabbing pain in my back. Then I blacked out but it felt like I had just nodded off for a second. I woke up when Charlene started shaking me. She was upset. She knew before I did that things weren't right and before I could stop her she was already on the phone talking to my doctor. Next thing I know I'm in an ambulance racing through traffic with sirens blasting and lights flashing. They took me straight into the operating room and I woke up a few hours later with a 9 inch incision on my side where my spleen should have been. The first sign that something wasn't right was when I started trembling. I thought it was just a  chill but Charlene knew better. Turns out she knew better than all the nurses and doctors because what mhad been written off as a minor infection turned out to be meningitis without Charlene's insisting on the hospital doing further tests I wouldn't be here today.

He also had a part in the ceremony where he thanked everyone and told about what he'd learned over the years. As he came to each person, he told a little story about them and even came to tears several times. It was very emotional for me. He's 18 years old now so he's been in that period where he doesn't want to show his emotions to anyone, though he let his guard down at the ceremony. Several times I remember taking a look around to see all the people who were there to support him and it warmed my heart. I could not ask for a better kid. I think that was solidified in the way he presented himself at the ceremony. It will definitely be an event I will remember for the rest of my life.

The weather was unseasonably warm as I stepped outside to head to the gym to get a swim in. Baby Cameron, the name my husband and I had picked out soon after I found out I was pregnant, was taking his time being born. The night before, my husband and I had discussed our options for inducing birth if it didn't happen naturally this week. I was scared because I had read that induction can cause complications. That of course didn't need to happen, thankfully. Maybe the shock of the cold water or the mild exercise induced labor, but as soon as I stepped out of the pool I felt my first contraction. I immediately called my husband. He rushed from home where he was getting ready from work to pick me up and take me into the hospital. When we arrived at the hospital I was immediately taken to a delivery room. The doctor I had chosen for my birth was thankfully on duty at the time and was able to come in right away. He checked my cervix and announced that the baby would come soon. The next few hours that followed were a blur of pain and hard work. I opted for a natural birth with no medication, and I'm glad I did. It wasn't fun, but I got to fully experience the wonder of birth. My husband was at my side the entire time while I squeezed his hand. Finally, at 11:01am, Cameron was born. He was a beautiful baby with a thick head of black hair.

John had to work, and he asked me if they could stay with us. I was kind of worried. Sure, John and Mary and the kids used to live next door to us (which is how John and I *ahem* connected), so the kids all knew each other, but it had been a couple of years since they split up and sold the house, and I wasn't sure how this would work. And Bobbie and Greta were kind of standoffish at first, and who could blame them? But Marcia and Jan were oblivious, thank heavens. They took B&G to the mall, and to the theme park, and they snuck around next door when the \"new\" neighbors weren't home and peeked through the windows, which must have been weird for B&G. Their old place has changed -- a lot -- and they were pretty quiet that night.

John was at Mary's, making sure she was ready to take back the kids, so it was just us girls. It was a warm, still summer evening, and we went out back after supper to sit on the porch. When the fireflies started to come out, Bobbie and Greta squealed like eight-year-olds, not the teens they are now, and asked if I had any bottles. Apparently there aren't lightning bugs where they live now. I found four bottles -- some glass, some plastic -- and watched in bemusement as all four girls ran around collecting fireflies. It was like a last hurrah for childhood, and I was as glad for those two girls as I was for my own daughters. And now we go forward.

At the end of my lessons I usually chat a bit with my teacher, as it's difficult to fill up an entire half hour lesson with nothing but teachings about guitar and going over scales and such. During each lesson he gets me to play through whatever song or scale or technique he had been teaching me the week (or multiple weeks) earlier. This particular lesson while we were talking he paused for a moment and brought up that he'd noticed I was really struggling to learn a particular song, and that it had been \"beating me up\" for several weeks as I was attempting to learn it. I had been practicing the song a lot but I wasn't getting much better at it despite my best efforts, and I was concerned that it appeared to him that I wasn't actually practicing it enough due to my abilities not improving much over time. He remarked that he admired the fact that I was determined enough to keep sticking with it and carrying on despite how challenging it was for me to learn the song. He also told me that as he was old enough to be my father, he felt it was appropriate to tell me that he was very proud of me with how far I had come with learning guitar, and that he has many students who drop out after only a few months of taking lessons. I thanked him and was left a little bit speechless by his words, it was unexpected and it meant a lot to me that he was really seeing my progress over time - especially when I was worried because I myself wasn't seeing much of my own improvements. As I was leaving at the end of the lesson he reminded me to keep working at it and that I would eventually be able to play it, it would just take time. His comments renewed my desire to learn the song and I was motivated to continue learning it over the next few weeks. I got to a point where I was able to play it with minimal mistakes and better timing than before. I was quite touched by it because not many people are so genuine and open with their thoughts or compliments about others, and I don't often receive praise like that in my everyday life. It can be frustrating taking up a new hobby, especially if you're not good at it and to hear recognition that you're doing well and still progressing can alleviate some insecurities about your lack of ability. It can also motivate you more to keep pursuing it even if it is difficult.

There is a shortcut through a wooded section that saves a little bit of time, and we decided to use that. It was very dark and quiet in the woods. About half way through the shortcut, we heard a coyote howl that sounded pretty close. Needless to say, it made us both jump and we picked up speed to be out of the woods quicker. After getting outside the woods we slowed down again. When we got to the graveyard, there was several bats flying around making chirping noises. It was really cool seeing them out like that.

At the time, I was very depressed and stressed about my financial situation because I was in debt, broke, and had over $200,000 worth of student loans. I was at the end of my road because I was waking up extremely sad every day and I felt like I had nothing to live for. I was discouraged because I had been applying for jobs for months prior to graduating but everyone said i was applying too early and that I needed more experience. The longer I was unemployed the more depressed I had gotten. At this point, I was losing so much weight I was down to about 90 pounds and my appetite was pretty much non-existent. I decided that I needed to do something because I felt myself going to a very dark place that was scary to think about and I felt like I was going to end up doing something irrational that I would regret. I needed help but didn't want to ask anyone for help. I decided that I needed to get up and get my life together. One particular morning I woke up and applied to at least 30 jobs in one day. I was determined to find a job because I knew that would solve at least some of my problems. It would provide me with a stable full-time salary so I would be able to take care of some of my debt and other financial obligations. The next day, I decided that I needed to talk to someone, so I called a help hotline. I was on the phone with a specialist for about an hour and a half and she was able to help me feel better. The specialist boosted my confidence and gave me some tools that I could use next time I was feeling depressed or stressed. About a week later, I got called for an interview that I was really interested in.

On the last day of work before the vacation, my father was in a severe car accident, another driver drifted into his lane and hit him in a head-on collision. The entire left side of his body was crushed. I went to see him in the hospital the next day when he was stabilized and had a unique conversation with him. On my way home, I told my wife \"I just had a conversation that people in movies have with someone before they die\". He told me that he loved me, he was proud of me, he loved my wife and son, and how important we are to him. That was the last conversation I had with him, at least where he was coherent. His condition went up and down like rolling waves, some days screaming in pain and other days completely unconscious, but never able to even answer basic questions like who he was, where he was, or who was president. I spoke with him and he described to me about how I was covered in slime, but not to worry, that he knew a bunch of rats that could clean me off. Hand restraints had to be put on him to prevent him from ripping out his IV's and other medical equipment. After being in the hospital for nine days, he was due to be discharged to a physical therapy rehab facility the next day. He had recovered enough that they could remove his restraints, and I told him once he was out of the hospital, I would bring him a cheesesteak from our favorite restaurant. I told him I loved him and I would see him the next day after work, as my vacation was ending. I go in to work the next day and within four minutes of arrival, I received a call from the hospital that he had died. The following week leading up to his burial was one of the most challenging weeks of my life for several reasons. My father and I were the only members of our family who maintained the familial religious beliefs, and part of my obligation to him as his son (the only son capable of doing so) I dressed him in certain religious clothing before the funeral home placed him in his casket. The idea of dressing my fathers corpse kept me up and night and gave me nightmares, but it was actually a very cathartic experience. He had an autopsy performed, so his body was in a plastic suit to prevent leakage from the incisions. While it sounds traumatic, it was a tender experience and a service I was glad to perform for him, as he had no one else able to do it.", "label": "recalled", "group": "TLCCVGOK"}

Cultural and historical, with great food, and of course, most of his family. He had told our kids he would be taking them to California for vacation this summer, but then his father got sick. His dad, who lives in Mexico, was diagnosed with a type of cancer that is not curable, and expected life span is about 5 years at most. So on very short notice, about 2 days, my husband decided that we would all go to Mexico so he could see his dad and family. I am the one that does the packing for pretty much everyone, myself and 3 kids, and even my husband to an extent. I had to get the dog into a kennel and get everything ready for the trip. We had passports ready, so that was a big worry out of the way. The drive, and we do have to drive because 5 round trip tickets is unbelievably expensive, is anywhere from 16 to 22 hours, depending on how long it takes to cross the border. I always dread crossing because there is usually something we need to process, some paper we forgot, or we are one of the unlucky people who get to have all of our stuff searched. We got to the border without incident, and then I could feel my stomach tighten as we parked the car to go get our visitor permits. Thankfully, that went rather quickly, and we were back into the truck in a short time and ready to go into Mexico. We were very lucky and didn't get stopped for a search. The first border agent we saw didn't even ask for passports, but he is right at the crossing. There was one, i knew, coming up several miles later. Astoundingly, we were not bothered there, either. He checked our passports, not permits, and on we went. Since the crossing took such a minimal amount of time, we arrived in my husband's city in about 16 or 17 hours.

I was very worried since I saw tuzzi very badly and told me that if I could take her to veterinarian when I left work I said of course that yes but unfortunately tuzzi died minutes later she called me crying and I went immediately to my house. She and everyone was crying, I also cried as part of our family for more than 10 years and it was very painful. After that we took my daughters my wife and I to have an ice cream all 4 together. The day after we put tuzzi in a shoe box and buried him in the courtyard of my house along with a cross that my daughter did extempore. Maybe this story sounds absurd to many. Maybe there are sadder stories but the loss of tuzzi to our family was very tragic. in those 10 years we spent many things together, I gave that pet to my daughter when she was only 5 years old. He was about to turn 11 with us, a few days have passed and my daughter is already better, my youngest daughter also suffered the loss but not as much as the older one since she has a slightly nobler heart and the lost they do it very badly. I told her that I could burn another pet when she decided to do it but she said no, that it was fine since she does not want to know about pets at the moment, she says that as a tuzzi there are not two.

The dog was clearly old by the way it moved and it was not even wearing a collar. I got worried about it's safety so I jumped out and got a collar and leash and i had in my trunk. The dog seemed friendly enough but they were clearly scared of me and I didn't want to put it in more danger so I kind of shepherded it towards the side of the road. From there I was able to approach the dog and get close enough to put a collar and leash on it. Ok so where do I go from here I thought to myself as the dog had no collar or tags, and it was slightly past 9:30 at night. Thankfully my house was close by so I walked the dog into my garage and gave it some dog treats and water as it looked exhausted. This gave me some time to figure out what I would do next. I ended up making a big sign that I could post on the  street corner nearby thinking that its owners would be out looking for it. After the dog was refreshed a bit from some food and water I got a new idea. Since I couldn't call animal control at that time of night, I was left with a few options. Keep the dog for the night and call for it to be picked up in the morning. Or put the leash back on the dog and see if it would try to walk its way home. I chose the latter so off we went in the dark following the road until we got a few blocks away from where I lived. At this point the dog was trying to turn off of the road into some very dark paths and I was hesitant to go off the beaten path with my new friend. At this point a car turned onto the street and pulled into it's driveway, I thought It would be a good chance to ask a neighbor if they had a clue whose dog this was. As luck turns out they new the dog and pointed me to the home where it's family is and other than an awkward door knocking situation late at night everything went well and I was able to reunite the dog with its family.", "label": "recalled", "group": "HY9P5FBP"}

My boyfriend loved his job, we were finally finished unpacking, and a company called me back about an interview. But reality settled in pretty quickly one day when I realized: I had made this move for the benefit of my boyfriend and not myself. He had friends in Seattle whether or not  it be coworkers at his job, or cool people he meet through work. As for me, I had no friends or family. This was made abundantly clear on crisp fall afternoon. I remember the day clearly. I had spent most of the day hold up in our tiny  apartment preparing for my interview.  My boyfriend had called earlier and the day. He said Kia and Chad, a couple in his department, had invited us out for drinks. I was excited because it was my first night going out in the city with other people besides my boyfriend. So, prepping for my interview was really just away to kill time. To be honest I was not so enthusiastic  about the company as I once was when we first moved. As the time got closer, I donned my best dress and slipped into my favorite shoes. I was freshening up in the mirror when my boyfriend called to meet him at the location. I arrived to indie bar on the other side of town. The bar was upscale without being obnoxious . I was offered a drink as soon as I sat at the bar. My boyfriend and his friends arrived. We got a table, order a round and some appetizers. They were great people, but most of the time I felt left out the conversation, as they only talked about work, or insides office jokes.My boyfriend was not accommodating or tried to included me in their conversation. Eventually, we decided to go to a night club. We all hoped into an UBER, since we would be drinking for the night and didn't want to take the risk of driving. The nightclub was fun, but later into the night I lost my boyfriend and didn't see his friends either As almost two hours went buy, I realized my boyfriend left me alone in a crowded nightclub by myself, with no way home, and no friends in the area.", "label": "imagined", "group": "Q2DVBPLC"}

When we started looking for homes, everything was out of our price range.  The only thing we could afford were condominiums.   But we wanted a yard for our dogs, so that meant we needed a house with a yard.  We were getting a little depressed about our lack of options, but things soon changed.  We decided to go to a gospel retreat to lift our spirits.  While there, one of the ministers told us about this developer who had one home left in a new subdivision.  So, we immediately contacted the developer.  He told us that he would reduce the price of the home if we closed right away.  We had advance loan approval from our bank, but still needed another $10,000 for the down payment.  As it turned out, there was a charity raffle at the retreat and God intervened and made sure we won the prize, which was exactly what we needed--$10,000. So we had our financing in place and then came the free furniture!  We were in desperate need of furniture, but used every penny we had for the down payment.

We made two appointments in a town near my home town for a Saturday, but there was one store that I wanted to visit that was about an hour away.

Well, I was wrong! My mom and I walked into the bridal salon, and while we were waiting for the bridal consultant, we both locked eyes on a dress at the same time. We decided that I should try on that dress first, because it was absolutely beautiful. When our bridal consultant came up to us, we picked a few other dresses that matched my style, but I tried on the original dress first. Even though it was beautiful, I wasn't sure if it was the one for me, so I kept trying on more. After about a dozen dresses, I tried on another dress that was exactly what I had pictured myself getting married in...but I couldn't stop thinking about the first dress! So, I tried on the first dress again, this time with a veil, and my mom and I both knew--that was the one. The best part of the story comes next, though! At this bridal salon, they allow the first bride who purchases a dress to give it a name (like a human name), and my dress had never been purchased before. So, I got to name my dress after my maternal grandmother, who died fourteen years ago, and who my mom and I miss very much. We both cried! Then, the next day, the rest of my initial wedding dress crew came back with me so they could see the dress.

We had all just turned 18 and were looking for something to together before we all left for university. The PCT is over 2000 miles long stretching from Canada all the way to Mexico and takes at least 6 months to complete. Our goal was to complete the Oregon section and backpack all the way across Oregon into Washington in 3 weeks or less. We grossly underestimated our task. Our first challenge arose just minutes after landing in the small municipal airport 30 minutes from the trail head. We needed to find someone to drive us to the trail head before nightfall, which was quickly approaching. We found someone willing to take the 6 of us in a minivan the 30 minutes to the trail head. The unfortunate part was that our driver had no idea where the trail start was - and neither did we. He ended up dropping us off on a gravel road in the middle of nowhere, just an hour before sunset. What we had though was the start to the trail ended up being just a game trail. We were lost in a foreign state, in the middle of nowhere with no signal to use GPS, the sun setting behind us. So we picked a direction and started walking down the gravel road. Several miles later of the same landscape along with the now high moon lighting the road, we flagged down a passing truck, the first person we had seen in hours. We explained to him what we were doing and that we were lost, he told us to keep walking down the road and we will eventually find a sheriffs station who can help us out. He also made sure to remind us of the impossibility of our goal and that we should just go home. Later in the night, closer to 1 am we came across a group of rangers performing a search and rescue, we again explain our situation and after their several minutes of amusement at our situation they tell us that the trail is less than a mile up a nearby path. They kindly give us some food and water along with a map and send us on our way. We reached the trail head that night and went on to complete the rest of the Oregon section within 3 weeks - probably to the surprise of the man in his truck.

How I love playing live music for eager dancers! We give wings to their feet. Four of the six band members take turns dancing once or twice during the evening, year round, although, at the ball, we're lucky to get to dance once. This year, something very special was happening for the first time. I had introduced and taught a Scottish Country Dance, \"Mairi's Wedding\", to the group and helped find good sheet music for the three dance tunes for our arranger to set for recorders and violin. It's more challenging than most dances that the group has attempted, so the dancers gave their all to learning the complicated figures. Since I would be dancing, instead of playing, the band also had the challenge of learning three new music arrangements, without my help. The night before the ball, the unthinkable occured: I was in a serious automobile accident. I was miraculously unharmed, but both cars were towed; dear friends from the band rescued me and provided transportation the next day. After one last whirlwind of an afternoon workshop the day of the Ball, we were all as prepared as we could be.  We had gone through the most difficult of the dances one last time. Some guests from out of town were learning them for the first time, but did amazingly well. Then, everyone pitched in to help rearrange and decorate the hall, before dashing off to grab supper and change into ball costumes. When we returned to the hall, it was like stepping into another world and era. The hall looked magical. The setting seemed to inspire the dancers, who formed more perfectly aligned sets than ever before! Finally, the moment I'd been waiting for: it was time for Mairi's Wedding. In amazement and delight that I was still there to savor this experience, when our turn came for the lead, I looked at my partner and said, \"Let's fly!\" and we certainly did, sweeping through the figures joyously.

I have been diagnosed with end-stage renal disease and have been on dialysis for almost two years. When I look into my mirror, I don\u2019t just see a failing pancreas and two kidneys that have been laid off. I don\u2019t just see a very sickly person who might die. I see a woman and a mother whose life and personality have many different dimensions. A woman with a family that needs her more than ever. It wasn\u2019t always that way. In the beginning, when I was going through hemodialysis and had more than 15 graft surgeries and 17 tunneled catheter procedures, I felt like my illness was stamped across my forehead and imprinted on my heart. End-stage renal disease and hemodialysis seemed to have taken over my whole life. I was a patient. I barely remembered who I was before the disease. Eventually, I\u2019d finally had enough of being defined by my disease. I needed to take charge of my life. The first time I spoke up about what I wanted in regard to my treatment, my doctors were stunned. I took control and it was the best choice I had ever made--I think it may have saved my life. For the first time since I began dialysis, my doctors saw me as a whole person--a mother, an individual--and not just as a patient. Even more importantly, I was seeing myself as more than just my disease. Gaining my voice gave me back the parts of my life that I had missed. I was Cortney again, not just the lady with ESRD on dialysis.  My disease no longer consumed my whole life.", "label": "imagined", "group": "MFBPHL9U"}

My grandmother used to tutor my grandfather in school. When he first saw her,  he thought she was the most beautiful girl he'd ever seen. \"She had long dark hair and was carrying her books in her arms as she walked down main street.\" Not long after their tutoring sessions ended, they began a courtship and quickly fell in love.  It was the 1930's and they were young and poor. My grandfather couldn't afford to purchase a wedding ring for my grandmother. She didn't much care about a ring but my grandfather desired to give her one. Many years later,  my grandfather opened a jewelry store in a Fitzgerald, Georgia. On their fifteenth wedding anniversary my grandfather drove my grandmother to his store and had her pick out a wedding set. She chose a modest round cut diamond solitaire and a matching diamond fishtail band. She was very fond of the rings and would only wear them on special occasions that required formal attire. My grandparents have been gone for a couple of decades now but I often think of how determined my grandfather was in getting the rings. He only had an 8th grade education but in his lifetime he owned a Standard Oil filling station, a jewelry store, and was a brakeman for the railroad. Last year on my birthday my mother came over to bring me a card and a gift.  She handed me a little velvet box that had my Grandfather's jewelry store name embossed on it.   I shed some tears as I opened the box to see my grandmother's rings.  They were more beautiful than I remembered.  I was so deeply touched that my mother wanted me to have them. I now wear the band with my wedding set. The rings represent my grandfather's hard work, commitment, and love.  Wearing my grandmother's band makes me feel like a part of my grandparents are still with me.", "label": "retold", "group": "5QIF0R4K"}

I went thru the process of getting a realtor then i got a listing of homes she gave me. I then went thru the homes listing carefully and picked the house that i think me and my wife would like .

My brothers and I went on a few trails and the scenery was beautiful. At one point, we even saw a few deer running by. Nightfall eventually came and we went back to our campsite. We lit a fire and started cooking some hotdogs while talking about nostalgic memories that happened within our family. When it was time for me to go to bed, I went into my tent and laid down. It was quite hot so it took some time to get relaxed but the sounds of all of the birds and nature helped put me to sleep. The next day is when the most significant event of the trip occurred. We decided to complete the highest and most elevated trail of the park. It was tough and a lot of climbing was involved, but after some struggle and a few hours we finally made it to the top. At the peak of the mountain stood an American flag and a wave of relief went through me when I finally saw it. Looking down you could see all of the rivers and trees, the landscape was incredible.

Also just having a forty-hour a week job prevents me from getting enough sleep as I should. I could not imagine functioning without sleep and caring for a child. So I was ambivalent about my brother have a kid and being an uncle. The day after he was born I went to the hospital to visit them out of politeness. His wife, my sister-in-law was asleep fro medication - she had to have a c-section, my mom and her mom were there. When I came in my mom was holding the baby, and she asked if I wanted to hold him. I figured I should. I sat down and they gently gave him to me. He seemed so light and he was sleepy. It was awkward holding him at first, my mom took a photo of me literally ten seconds after passes the child to me. A change came over me, I held this little child and I realized I care for him. I want to be a good uncle and want to see him succeed and I can't wait to buy him gifts. I think this is because the kid is a blood relative - he has my blood in him.

I did not want him to be there. It was cold, he was going to freeze. I wanted to be with him, to keep him warm. I talked to my grandmother, trying my best to keep her mind off of this. Seeing her this way just broke my heart. It was a small funeral, about 12 people there. My grandmother's sister tried to hold onto her too letting her know it will be ok. Finally, a pastor said a prayer and his casket was lowered into the grown with red carnations that were adorned on top. Tears were streaming down my face as the wind whipped at them. I kept my head down, I didn't want anyone to see me this upset, I had to be strong. Once the casket was in the ground, everyone dispersed and we went out to eat for lunch. No one wanted to see the dirt that was going to be piled on top.", "label": "imagined", "group": "VH5MH5YK"}

My traveling companion suggested an uncovered bench next to a small reflecting pool. I suggested a well-covered bench about 10 feet away. Much to my chagrin, my companion forced me to the uncovered bench. After sitting down, I quickly opened our treats. When I turned back to face my companion, he was not on the bench; rather, he was on one knee in front of me holding a Claddagh ring&#151the Irish wedding bandAfter Jeff, my traveling companion and boyfriend of three years, asked me to marry him, I was speechless. I was so drawn into the beauty of the moment that it took me a few seconds to respond. But, after much hugging and kissing, I said, \u201cYesJeff and I set our wedding date for Aug. 11, 2001. That meant that I would have less than a year and a half to plan a wedding, keep everything in order and enjoy the moment. From that moment on, every childhood fantasy of my wedding day was coming at me at lightning speed. I knew then that I would need to do something to stay organized and to remember every moment of the most wonderful time in my life. That\u2019s when I turned to a wedding journal. When I tried to keep journals in the past, I would just use a notebook or loose paper, only to find that a month later I had either abandoned the notebook or lost the sheets of paper. So, this time I decided to take a different route when a friend gave me To Have and to Hold, A Wedding Journal. Ironically, but appropriately, the guided journal is published by the My Chaotic Life division of Walter Foster Publishing. I soon found out that chaos is the catchphrase when you are planning a wedding. I enjoyed using a guided journal for discipline, but using a journal that is blank inside is just as helpful. I know because I kept one of those, tooThe guided journal helped to keep me focused but I soon discovered that there were things missing that I really wanted to include. For example, Jeff and I decided to write a short piece that we would read to each other after we exchanged our vows. There wasn\u2019t a space in the guided journal for me to jot down thoughts or ideas for this \u201cuntraditional\u201d element, so I added notes on this into the pages of my personal wedding journal. Having space to explore my ideas helped me to write those special words", "label": "recalled", "group": "2O063XJF"}

I had actually just joined a couple months prior to that, and on my first night of working the overnight shift, I was told that the store was transitioning to new hours and my job was being eliminated.  I decided to stay on until the end of overnights.  The whole experience was interesting, oftentimes frustrating, quite challenging, and new.  I'd never worked in retail before so it was all a learning experience.  Even more challenging than that, I pushed myself very hard and my body struggled to keep up.  My knees were regularly swollen to the size of softballs, my back constantly ached and my fingers were all cut up from tearing corrugated cardboard.  Despite these challenges, I came to really like the crew I worked with.  They were good people and usually hard workers, even if they weren't from my background or didn't occupy the same social strata as me.  But we got along and had fun and felt like we were all in it together.  The overnight shift is challenging, both because of having to stay up all night and simply because you're asked to get more done because you're working in an empty store.  Plus, we were badly understaffed.  But that struggling means you bond more with the people you work with.  And so, even though I'd only worked with these people for a couple months, we all felt very close and found our last night together very poignant.  We were all scheduled to work that night and it was what I call \"good bull.\"  We laughed and joked with each other all night.  There were no hard feelings, no hurt feelings, no criticisms.  It was just a bunch of people working together, knowing they likely wouldn't see much or anything of each other going forward, and enjoying each other's company.  We all took our final break together and joked that the last item of the night should be stocked as a team.  We should pass it between each team member and then the most experienced team member should put the item on the store shelf.  Someone then joked that they should drop it and we all laughed.  At the end of the night we all felt good because we'd finished all the freight.  It was nice to finish with a \"win.\"  We then went to the break room to get our stuff and go home.  We all shook hands and thanked each other for the work we'd done, and told each other what a pleasure it had been to work together.  I was still the \"new guy,\" but I really felt part of the team and was sad it was ending.

Over in the night at a truck stop, my husband's trailer was robbed of some of the contents, which was boxes of frozen chicken. Not all was taken but a few boxes were. The truck stop, of course had no cameras, and he ended up having to file a police report and file an insurance claim. Since there was an insurance claim, my husband had to kept the load in his trailer until all investigation was over. With that being said, this investigation ended up taking over 2 months to resolve. First, it was trying to get an insurance claim person to look at the remaining contents in the trailer to see if they were still viable and can be sold off. Then, there was a back and forth for a moment, trying to determine if the insurance even covered frozen chicken. During these 2 months, still, my husband was not able to work because there was a load still on his truck. We blew through our bank accounts and our savings trying to maintain our bills and a household of 5. This put such a strain on our household and bank accounts. We have never experienced anything remotely close to this in our lives. To put an end to this story, after about 2 months, he was able to unload the contents in his trailer, however, by that time, we did not have any more money to maintain the daily expenses of operating a truck and had to give it up.", "label": "recalled", "group": "JTZXAQLG"}

We spent some time in the Dolomite mountains in northern Italy, based in the resort town of Cortina. We did some hiking while there, and while all the hikes were spectacular there was one particular one that still sticks with me. I knew that it was a tough hike, and added to that was the fact that part of it was going up a small waterfall aided by cables that were left over from world war I. My wife is a bit scared of heights, and she is also somewhat unconfident in her abilities even though she is quite athletic. I did what I suppose is a bad thing, and failed to mention the part about the cables when I was describing the hike for her. I knew that she would be able to do it, but also knew that she would refuse if I told her about it ahead of time. I know, I'm a bad person. Anyways, the hike began with a long and steep ascent up a mountain. As we neared the top (or so we kept thinking), the footing became more and more difficult as it was just loose rock, and we would slide down a bit with every step. Then we kept approaching what we thought and hoped were the crest of the mountain but to our dismay it never was. There was always more climbing on the other side. I was getting worried that my wife was going to quit, because to be honest this part of the hike was not all that scenic since we were just on the side of a mountain looking into it. Behind us was very pretty but we were not looking that way. Finally we came to another crest and we expected once again to be faced with another part of the mountain on the other side. Instead when we reached the top, it really was the top, and in front of us lay the entire Dolomite range for as far as we could see. The tops of the mountains looked like something from Lord of the Rings, all pointy and craggly. I actually got tears in my eyes at the sight. I will never forget that view for as long as I live, and the best part was we were the only ones who were up there. Unfortunately for my wife, next came the small waterfall and cables. I think she was too tired to even be mad at me. I even told her before we started that part that I knew about it but didn't tell her. I went first, and while it was a bit scary it wasn't anything we couldn't handle. My wife scampered up behind me and did a great job.

Every week, the intern group would head to local facilities where immigrants seeking asylum were held.  The group would give a presentation to the detainees about the services we provided and their rights as detainees.  At the end of the presentation,  one man walked directly up to me and began telling me his story.  The man said that he was from Eritrea.  He had been a professor there, and was persecuted for speaking out against the local government.  He had been jailed in a facility without windows for seven months and was subsequently released to return to work as a professor, this time with government agents sitting in on all of his lectures.  After one session in particular, Client felt as if he was going to be arrested and imprisoned again, and he set out to flee Eritrea, which he did successfully.  With the help of a false passport (his home government had confiscated his), and extended travels through three countries, Client arrived in America where he was subsequently detained.  After hearing his story, I decided to take him on as a client to help him gain asylum.  Over the course of 4 weeks I studied endlessly, learning everything there was to know about Client and asylum laws. A great deal of time was also spent with Client rehearsing the details of his long and harrowing journey and detailing the precise reasons he needed to be granted asylum.  At the end of the four weeks, the moment of truth arrived.  I entered the courtroom with Client and waited patiently.  After what seemed to be an eternity, our case was finally in front of the judge.  They called Client to the stand and we began the direct examination.  The examination was perfect.  Everything that Client and I had prepared for was executed seamlessly.  We were so thorough and convincing that the other examining party had minimal questions for Client and gave minimal push back to the idea that asylum was absolutely necessary for my client.

If she do decide to tell them about her pregnancy this is a good time to talk about any changes to her work that help. For example she might need easier access to a toilet. Or if smells from the kitchen or canteen are triggering her sickness maybe she could move some where else until she feel better. Try not to worry too much about people knowing she was pregnant its more important to look after herself. If she was vomiting several times a day or are not able to eat and drink at all without being sick she may be dehydrated which is why she feel so bad. If her sickness is really severe and she were struggling to control it she may need to go into hospital for treatment. she feel free to better suituation for her life time.", "label": "imagined", "group": "FDU55U11"}

She knew that I had wanted to buy this guitar for over a year now. She also knew that I would never spend that kind of money on something just for me. I thought it was a silly purchase though since I don't know how to play. It has always just been a dream of mine. I was so grateful and excited that I made her come to the music store with me the very same day. When we walked into the store my eye immediately went to where I knew the guitar was on the wall. It was so beautiful. It was a dark creamy brown with a thin vine like pattern on the neck. I asked the sales person to get it down for me, because I could't reach it. She handed it to me and it felt better than I had imagined. My friend and I went over to sit down by the back wall and I strummed it for a bit before making the final decision to purchase my dream guitar. I purchased the guitar and actually signed up at the store for lessons since I had such a wonderful time there. I realized that night while just staring at the guitar in my room that sometimes the simplest things can be the most beautiful.", "label": "imagined", "group": "HFTU3WRO"}

So he got his robe, hat and tassel, and drove to the school ahead of us around 7am because the school was about 2 hours away. Me and my husband wanted to leave at 8am to make it to the 10am graduation. However, because of a \"bathroom incident\", we didn't end up leaving until 8:30am.

We actually got to the school with 10 minutes to spare, but there was no more parking in the school's lot. We searched around for about 5 minutes and found a spot a couple blocks away. I grabbed my purse with the tickets and ended up having to run all the way to the school. We got there just in time to hear my son's name being called, and told my husband to quickly take out his camera so we could record the moment.

I didn't realize it at the time, but she was teaching me to speak Russian which is where she was from. At the time I just thought it was a fun game where I would get sweet candy rewards when I would win. It wasn't until I was older that I realized I had been learning another language all this time. Once I had my own family I decided that I would carry on the tradition. Whenever my young kids want to play, I pull out the same cards that I used to learn from. My grandmother left them to me when she passed away. Playing with my kids and watching them learn has been a great experience for me. I know now how my grandmother felt when she was teaching me. Not only am I having fun with my family, but I am helping to keep alive the family tradition.

I thought, no problem, and told him it would be ok since I was off that day. I told him just to gas up and get it back safely after his shift. Little did I know that he had other plans in store that involved the law and I was being taken for a ride so to speak. This is the story of how my good friend got arrested and it led to the end of our friendship. After my friend took the car, I got a call from the police about an hour later saying that he was now in prison and I had the option of bailing him out. I did end up bailing him out, but thought - what in the world is going on? It turns out he had been tipped off that something was going on at his work and so when he took my car - thinking they would not recognize him in it - he was still arrested at his job place (during his shift) for embezzlement. His plan had not worked and in the process, I also could not pick up my car right away. Turns out it had to be impounded and I had to pay an additional 80. 00 dollars to get it out of the lot since I was not present at the time of this activity. This whole situation affected our relationship in a number of ways. We are still friends and ok generally, but not as close now. It broke my trust with my friend and made me look around at all things in my life. And secondly, it showed me that people you know, even, will do anything when they are desperate. He had been having money trouble and thought he could get away with this. It turns out cameras at his job place knew different and that is how he was eventually caught. The lesson learned here - do not trust just anyone - be very careful. Even the closest to you have their own agendas.", "label": "imagined", "group": "5SFWDVNK"}

Later on, though, I saw signs up about it, so I called the people up to take it to them. Come to find out, they were using the poor thing for breeding. Puppies can be very expensive, so these people were making upwards of 400 bucks a pop off this almost adult dog. The weird thing is how open they were about it and how they didn't see anything wrong with it. They weren't licensed breeders, they don't know how to take care of dogs like this. I had to do something about it. I called up the humane society and a couple animal lovers to see if they knew what I should do. I was told it wasn't even illegal, which was a shock.

One of the funniest things that happened was the morning we were leaving, my wife had some allergic reaction to something, and her lips swelled up like she got Botox!  It was funny. The swelling went away fairly quickly, so it was easy to laugh about it.  Another funny thing was the dance party that took place at the main pool.  There were some very intoxicated people up there shaking what they had and having fun.  We laughed and laughed as we LOVE people watching.  The most important thing was that my wife and I got to focus on each other and we both felt like it strengthened our marriage even more than it already was.  I really encourage all married couples (especially parents) to get away here and there, even if it is for a night or a weekend.

After quite awhile, a vehicle started passing everyone in the opposite lane, which we thought was crazy! So my husband called one of his employees (a park ranger, which is a police officer for a state park) and told him that a vehicle just passed everyone and they were driving strange. The park ranger said that vehicle had just reached him, that they were all responding to an accident (the passer was an off-duty fireman responding to the call). There had been a fatal accident. A car with a father, mother, and three kids had pulled out in front of an oncoming large SUV. Two children died in the accident. We eventually reached the scene and it was horrifying. It made me rethink our tiny car we drive with our three sweet children. I try not to think about that day. I do, however, stay even more cautious while driving than I used to. Like I mentioned earlier, it is very touristy here and those tourists drive unsafely - people not realizing they're on a highway at a high speed and just pulling out in front of others, passing people on the shoulder, etc... it gets so hectic.

This particular route was about five or six miles, a longer and rockier trail than I had been used to. Part of the trail touches the school yard I remember so well from being a child. I decided to cross the narrow band of woods that separates the yard from the trail and look at what had changed. The forest opens to a groomed field, grass still wet from the morning dew. It had once been a soccer field, now the goal posts fell to rot and ruin. A baseball diamond to the left, rusted chain link fence. Separating the field from the playground was once a row of trees. Only one was left now. I walked towards it, an eery feeling creeping from my stomach into my throat where it stretched and grew and enveloped my good sense. It was a June morning, and the kids had long since left on their vacation. It was absolutely quiet there, serene and haunting. My feet heavy from the trek, my motions were almost lethargic.

It was in the middle of the evening, and I was in the middle of a cold, so I hoped to spend the rest of the day recovering. However, I received a message on the job website--a response to my application, and a request to interview right away. I was taken aback, not expecting something so soon and so relatively informal. The interview was to be done on Google Hangouts, as soon as possible. This sounded strange, but the position was fairly small and low-skilled, but certainly better than nothing. I made coffee and psyched myself up. As I came back to the site, I received more messages from the person--impatient and passive-aggressive in tone, admonishing me for taken long to reply. I apologized, and did my best to get in touch with their people and set-up the interview. I received some interruptions from my grandfather, who was going through a tough time, and I helped him as best I could, as quickly as I could, and apologized to the person. They continued to push me along in a brusque manner, but I was grateful for the opportunity. I began the interview, and for the most part, things went off without a hitch. While I could've used more occupational experience in some of the job's aspects, I was otherwise qualified. However, I noticed that the person's grammar was somewhat odd. As they claimed to be from France, it was not something that I could judge. That being said, once they seemed clueless about my specific posting, and offered more than twice the amount that I had put in for, I became extremely skeptical. As they waited for me to answer a variety of questions, I took the time to search the name of the company and my general predicament. I was met with several warnings to immediately shut down the interview and walk away: my interviewer an apparent scammer. My heart sank, and I quickly poured over every bit of information I'd shared. It was nothing more than my business e-mail and phone, but still things that I do not want bothered. I blocked the interviewer, as well as the people that had directed me to them, and kept an eye out on strange contacts from phone or e-mail.

Maybe people think I should have waited another 10 years but there are key people in my life I wanted to witness us renew our vows and as morbid it may sound, possibly will not be with us another ten years. Added addition to the ceremony is  our lovely 6 year old daughter who were our flower girl. I bought a simple, yet pretty gown and my husband got a tailored made suit. Our daughter got the prettiest dress ever and we set the date over the winter on the beach in our local city, Miami.  The ceremony was beautiful and my husband and I expressed our love to each other and the blessing,m our daughter we have created. We had a small gathering following the ceremony in our backyard where our guests can mingle. Everyone goes to our home and good food, music, and drinks is  served. The open bar was a hit, maybe too much of it as few of the guests, including my husband got sloppy drunk. While others danced with drunk(ness) on the dance floor, including my husband, one, my \"lovely\" uncle step it up a notch and started to flirt with other women, while aunt is present and gotten rowdy. I was somewhat embarrassed and my aunt came to me to say she will handle it and taken my inebriated uncle outside to calm down. Luckily all this transpired shortly after my daughter went inside the house  with a older cousin whom we asked to babysit my daughter. Aside from my husband who could not remember half of the night and my crazy uncle who had to sleep away his liquor, overall the wedding was beautiful and everyone enjoyed themselves. I got another chance to celebrate my 10th wedding anniversary and once again fall in love with husband. That night also serves a reminder why I am once pregnant again months later.", "label": "imagined", "group": "FT66C2R4"}

This is something we haven't done since the second child was born. It took some planning as we currently do not reside near any family member. My mom agreed to fly over and watch the boys while we took the trip. We had to make sure that our trip coincided with mom's calendar as to when she could get a vacation from work. We decided on Las Vegas as we heard of all the live shows and it seemed like something we would be interested in. The day of the trip came and my mom was here and all settled in with the boys. While I was very nervous leaving them for an extended period, I had all confidence in my mom who already raised 7 kids herself. Getting to Las Vegas and seeing all the street performers, the many sights and the crowds was exciting and overwhelming at the same time. The live show we saw was magical.  The acrobatic movements of the cast daring and scary but  was a sight to behold. Dressing up in anything but leggings and t shirt was also a welcome change. It was simply amazing. The most memorable part of this event was being able to reconnect in a special way with my husband. Having the chance to focus only on each other helped us to remember why we fell in love .

Susan wasn't thrilled, but took it better than I did. We got the things and went to the hospital. We waited for the longest time to get helped by someone. We eventually called our doctor and  he sent information down for us. We got our room and then the issues really started. She was in labor and despite everything, she wasn't progressing like she should have been. We were there 15 hours before the doctor said she was going to need a c-section. I fought against it and so did Susan. We wanted a natural birth! The doctor urged more and we ended up allowing it. It was stressing Susan and the nurses all said that stress was the last thing that she needed.

It wasn't until I met my significant other years back that I came to this question with an actual answer. Our times have been splendid, we have fallen harder over the past 2 years and 3 months together with plenty of eventful times together. Over the summer it's been quite the lovely one with trips to Disney Land, others to different parts such as Seattle, Los Angeles, etc.  All of them were magnificent times that have paved the way for me to ask her to one day become my wife. After an eventful time at our conventions, a hobby we have involving gaming, comics, anime and more, we opted to go to California for a trip to an event called \"Anime Expo\". She's usually rather excited about this event due to the fact she can dress up as her favorite characters as do most others do as well. It's always a lovely time, the atmosphere is fantastic with all the people having a blast going around to booths, visiting voice actors and checking out merchandise halls. As usual we had quite the lovely time together, spent all of our time dressing up, going out as characters from series such as \"Darker than Black\" and \"My Hero Academia\" with lots of laughs, gifts and food to enjoy. Although we had lots of fun to share with each other I still had in store one more event after all was said and done. Typically we do go out to eat together so on that note we took a bus ride all the way down to a pier to enjoy the area, look around to gaze at the scenery and for me to be able to catch her off guard with a ring in a relatively quiet, calm area. She was completely taken aback from the ring, confused initially then started to cry as most would. Of course she did not expect it in the slightest but was more than happy to oblige with her own ecstatic joy reaching down to grab, hug me completely ignoring the ring as she says, \"Yes!\". Could not have been a happier event of our lives that leads me to the main questions that have bugged me over the years. Why do I live exactly?

My kids are ready going to their college in next a few year. We scheduled for 9 university information sessions and the corresponding campus tours during this trip. We have greatly enjoyed this impressive and informative trip. We directly contacted with the teachers and students from these universities and learned a lot of new information about our interested university. This was a very important visit for my kids to prepare their university applications later on. As their parents, we also felt this visit was very helpful for us to prepare for the coming important events. We learned how to start the preparations for the promising universities earlier. My son has been aiming on his dream school, MIT, because his friends went to this school. I helped him to sort the candidate majors out and went through the admission pages carefully. After talked with the teachers and students there, my son recognized what were his strengths and weaknesses. He said he would start preparations of his standardized tests more earlier. He have made a detail plan for the next 3 years for this endeavor. I thought that it would be better for a family to arrange this kind of campus visit more earlier, i.e. 3 years prior to the university application. This kind of activities obviously encouraged my kids to be more active on their studies. As parents, we also could help them in more specific manors instead of non-focused ways. Through these visits, my kids had their direct experiences with the university campus life. We learned more detail about their interested majors in the candidate universities instead of just numbers such as accept rate and university ranking. We would narrow down the school list and re-visit some of them in the future. In summary, this trip was a very important for us to help the kids to prepare their college application in the coming years.", "label": "recalled", "group": "5L0CK5G7"}

My five year son had been acting odd peeing the bed, excessively drinking and eating a ton of food for about two weeks so I decided to take him in to the doctor. I was sitting  in the physician's office waiting on his urine test result when she came in to tell us yes there was glucose in his urine and next we would do a finger stick. The fingerstick reading was 562. We were in utter shock as she told us we needed to rush him to the hospital immediately and could not stop at home to grab clothes. In the ER the antibody tests were run, we were told we would need to stay in the hospital for three days for Type one diabetes training. I stared at my little boy in the hospital bed hooked up to an IV in disbelief. I could not believe that just hours ago I had given him breakfast without a care in the world and now he would need insulin with each meal to even survive. It was so hard to wrap my head around the fact that without insulin my child would die and he would need it for the rest of his life. The next days were filled with holding down a crying five year old giving him shots, him tearfully asking when his diabetes would go away and me sneaking in to the hospital bathroom to cry. It was a time of grieving the life that he would never have, a life without insulin. It was a time of sorting thru the mess and finding hope as well. Seeing the tiny triumphs of him not crying thru his last finger pokes in the hospital and his excitement to leave the hospital behind and just head back to being a child with a few minor adjustments. As much as that time shook me to my core and brought me to my knees with grief I also saw strength and hope in a child that I never imagined I would see. I may be here to raise and protect my son but he is my hero and he saved me by teaching me that there is hope and light in even the darkest of circumstances.", "label": "recalled", "group": "0LBZ1W3Y"}

My family joined a program that brings children over from Belfast, Ireland each summer to stay away from the \"troubles\" and violence that occurs in the summer over there. We were matched up with an 11 year old girl who came and stayed with us for 6 weeks. We quickly bonded. She became the sister I never had (I only have a brother), and she came to stay with us for many summers after that. She is a huge part of my childhood and we grew up together in the summers. The last time she was here was when I was 20... which was 10 years ago. In those last 10 years we both got married, had kids, and got homes of our own. So much had happened, and life passed us by. We kept in occasional touch on Facebook, and knew what was going on in our lives, but we hadn't seen each other in a long time. This July, she came back for the first time in 10 years with her husband (who had been here a few times when we were teens, but as her boyfriend) and two small kids. We got to meet each other's kids and spent a wonderful two weeks together. She stayed at my brother's house and we had get togethers, dinners, baseball games, and other fun activities. When I first saw her, the day after she arrived, I was so joyful. I didn't expect to be so excited, but I was smiling, laughing, and giving her a huge hug. It was a wonderful moment. We spent two weeks together with all of our families and children doing so many fun, memorable things. When they had to leave, it was definitely a bit heartbreaking. I know I will see her again but I don't know when.

Well, as you know when I think that something usually goes wrong. This time was no different. We had a couple of great days on vacation, however at night on the second day Abby got sick. We thought she ate some bad food and was just having a stomach ache. In the morning, she was puking and said that her sides and back and tummy hurt. I had no idea what to do, so my husband took her to a doctor there. I took the kids for Disney day three. Around lunch, my husband called to let me know that Abby had to go to the hospital because she had something wrong. I started to freak out and immediately told the kids we were going to see Abby. Abby somehow got gallstones and was having a gallbladder attack. I had no idea a child could have that! She ended up getting her gallbladder removed and for her, the vacation ended.

I was working a dead end job and was forced to live in an apartment in the shady part of town. This lasted about 6 months.

It was a little strange, but my choices were limited and him and I were both fine. He didn't appear to be a crackhead but I heard rumors among the complex. One day he just snapped. The first was when my rent was usually due. I went to his office like normal. When giving him the cash, he stood up, silent. Then he started berating and yelling at me. I was genuinely confused and started to leave. That's when he threw a punch at me. I was able to avoid it.

I remember when the young man was born. i also knew his parents for many years now. He has a unique success story and an amazing immigrant story as well. His parents came from Mexico. They somehow managed to store their son in the luggage area of the cargo in order to get him to come to the states. His parents owned a store that did well in Mexico but the gangs there were robbing them and making their lives miserable. The son managed to come over to America and stay with family in Texas. After awhile the parents came over and started their business in Texas too. That is when I met them as they hired me to work in their store. When they told me their story I was in awe of what they did for their son. It was really brave of the boy not to get caught in the cargo area. The boy was only 9 at the time of his travels to america. I have helped their family out for many years and got to know them very well.

A few days ago, I was having dinner with my friend whose wedding played an important role in my life.  We went through some pictures from the wedding album as we took a stroll down memory lane. As I went through the pictures, I refreshed my memory about how the wedding planning started and how it all came together. The hard work that went into and the final outcome that made me realize the part I played in the entire event. People often say that family events matter a lot. But in this case it was a close friend whose wedding became an event even bigger than anything I had ever done for a family member. It was a great honor to have been chosen by the bride to be a part of the wedding planning. The toast raised to thank me for my hard work was a surprise and even today it makes me tear up a little. I sincerely hope that my friend is able to help someone near and dear to her like I did. So she can enjoy the moment of being part of an immensely joyful event. The effort and hard work that goes into planning an event as big as a wedding is certainly rewarding when it becomes a success. Just knowing that your gestures and planning has made two people happy and helped build memories for life to cherish. It sometimes makes me wonder about the time and effort that goes into organizing an event as significant as a wedding and the outcome of that final day coming into play.", "label": "retold", "group": "4RC4SVWL"}

I am married with no kids and generated over 95% of the family income while employed. We live in LCOL rural TN. Our asset allocation is approximately 60% VTSAX (total US stock market) / 20% VFWAX (total INTL stock market) / 20% VWLUX (US municipal bonds). We also hold roughly $400k in house, land, and belongings not included in the portfolio. My spending model places no dependence upon possible future employment (outside pharmacy?), social security ($10k/yr?), inheritance ($500k?), house equity (reverse mortgage with no heirs?), universal health care (probable?), or universal basic income (possible?). The final balance will be left to charities and worthy causes. Two years later: A wild year for the market, but everything seems to be going as planned. We entered year two of early retirement at $1.146M on 6/1, peaked at $1.199M on 9/20, bottomed at $1.008M on 12/24, peaked again at $1.202M on 5/3, and finished back down at $1.138M. I think the concept of retiring early must include shaping a new, purposeful identity, whether that is in some kind of nonprofit work, traveling, writing, managing investments, etc. Peter Drucker talks about this concept in Managing Oneself, in that truly successful people work at their encore career/retirement plan and skills needed years before it happens. Our need to create and contribute doesn\u2019t have to take the shape of work, but it doesn\u2019t go away. And if we\u2019re not purposeful about it then it becomes whatever we are already doing. I'd have an identity crisis if I was suddenly \"not a programmer\", but barring brain damage, nothing is going to make me \"not a programmer\", certainly not retiring. Financial security, even without the RE portion, will provide a permanent happiness boost for most people.

In these scrimmages there are ups and downs. Sometimes we won't like to play any scrimmages at all because we be burnt out. Sometimes we will not be in the same page as a team and we would just get frustrated from each other. The lesson that we learned from this is that, we need to rest sometimes and not just play all the time. So, our plan changed every week to practice. Long story short, we ended up winning twelve out of the fourteen games of the season. This means that we were in the playoffs after a long season. The playoffs will start 3 weeks after the season ended, which is bad for us in my opinion. It was bad for us because we got comfortable and we would stop practicing because we think that we were better than our opponents for the playoffs.

I was shocked and turned to be sure my daughter was okay when out of the corner of my eye, I saw the other car backing away from our car and then speeding off down the road! I was too surprised to make note of many details of the car, and certainly not make note of the license plate or any very identifying information. I was able to note the color and general style of the car (a sedan) but couldn't recall anything about the driver or the make or model of the car. After I confirmed my daughter was physically okay but just scared, I pulled our car to the side of the road and comforted her. A nearby resident who had heard the collision came out and checked on us. She offered to call the police while I comforted my child and assessed the damage. When the police showed up, they asked for all the details I could recall about the other car and said they'd look. They checked the damage on my car to try to see if there were any clues that would help them identify the other vehicle. They told me to call my insurance company and an agent came to the scene. The police didn't seem overly invested in actually solving the crime and said they'd get back to me if they had any info but I have had to call them for updates periodically as no one ever reaches out to me. I guess it'll never be solved most likely. Thankfully, my insurance was great about getting my car fixed even though these things are always a hassle. I guess I'm mostly just thankful that neither of us were injured and that the car was drivable and not totaled.

I was living with her for a few months until I could get on my feet, because I was new to the city. And at a distance, with enough time between interactions- the bossy, assured nature she would dictate our time together in, was almost a comfort. I really liked having her be that for us, and I think she really enjoyed having me being compliant and helpful. But when a few times a month became everyday, the tension began to build. Perhaps I would offer to take the dogs out a few days she was busy getting ready in the morning. Then the next week she would ask me every day to take her dogs out and to also feed them. When the clothes sitting in the washer were blocking me from doing my laundry, I would go ahead and finish out her loads of laundry. Then the next week she would ask me to do her laundry for her. It would even be things that weren't house care related. If she didn't want to be alone doing something, she would ask me to accompany her to do it-perhaps watching her hang up her clothes, or sit with her while she studied. Well one particular night it came to a head when she asked me to come help her clean up the kitchen. I had not dirtied up the kitchen, and I didn't want to clean it up. And when she would ask for help doing something-you can bet that meant I was just going to do most if not all of it, and she absolutely used that to her advantage. But this night, I said no. She was so taken aback by this that she got angry with me. I was so offended that she would get mad that I declined to help on this ONE thing that it escalated quickly over the next 40 minutes. We started kitchen-sinking, mudslinging, slandering, defaming each other just specifically calling out every minuscule problem we had with each other over the past month. Until eventually we got up in each other's faces and she slapped me across the face. It's been about 4 months since then, and we still haven't spoken.

The team had been thrilled to be here in the first place. We were subpar team the year before and all of a sudden we were at the top of our game being able to compete with the best teams in the district. I had spent the night before just watching old dodger games trying to get pitching tips from the great Hideo Nomo. I was raised watching him and wanted to pitch just like him. My coaches told me otherwise though and let me know it is not a good thing because it hurts your back in the long run. We had arrived at Milikan Park. I didn't want to get off the bus as I was nervous as can be. We went in the locker rooms and I dressed up and was ready to pitch. We got on the field and surprisingly the stands were half empty. I was told that the fans weren't being let in because of a riot that happened there. Once the stands filled up I was up to pitch at the top of the 1st inning. I got on the mound. Surprisingly I was ready. I struck out the side in the first inning. I feel like overall my past history of failures lead me this inning and the rest of the game. I was tired of failing at all I tried and I wanted something new for a change. At the bottom of the ninth we were down 3-2 as the relief pitcher had let in 3 runs at the top of the inning. We managed to battle back and win it off a two run blast by my childhood friend Jim. It was what we used to dream of as kids. Winning anything together. It didn't happen in the pros but it felt like it did. We never made it to the majors, so this is the best memory I have of the game of baseball and it happened 3 months ago.", "label": "recalled", "group": "EBEYTQEG"}

I always thought of chess as something of a \u201cnerd sport\u201d; less of a sport and more of an assignment .. like homework. It wasn\u2019t until experiencing the play-through of chess and learning the significance of each piece that I began to take interest in it . Cut to a few months after my first game that I thought it would be an excellent idea to join the chess club, and eventually we found ourselves in a few tournaments; Everyone in my school that takes part in the tournament takes it very seriously. This isn\u2019t like a game of connect four, where you go, \u201cAww, man,\u201d and laugh when you\u2019re defeated. When you lose, it means(at least to us, and the other teams taking part) that you have lost something more than a game. Although deep down we all know that this is just a game; We also love how dignified it all seems. How much respect we all have for the game is what brings us all together I think. We had put together a team that was relatively well-rounded or so we thought, until we were knee deep in losses and on our last game, which of course is very stressful, even for someone who doesn\u2019t take it as seriously as us. We knew we would have to figure out a new strategy for next year and establish some new players. This would mean some players of the team would not be happy. But we probably would be. I knew that out of all the players, I wouldn\u2019t be one of the ones being cut. I was one of the best players we had. I felt bad for what we would have to. Ultimately though, I knew the members would understand. We would absolutely need to balance out the teams weaknesses with more seasoned players.

Life alone is not easy, especially for a divorcee starting over in her 'golden years'.  I normally pull over and eat a quick sandwich in the car, but yesterday, I was just too tired to deal with eat, and really craved the presence of other people for a change. I was happy to see a small but run-down diner on the horizon around lunchtime. When I walked into the smoke-filled diner, a young waitress with a pulled-back pony tail greeted me with a jagged-tooth smile and handed me a menu as she walked me to my booth. I noticed a scant number of other diners seated randomly in the restaurant. As I sat and studied the greasy menu, i happened to peer over the top, feeling the gaze of someone on me. I saw a man sitting at the counter, staring straight at me. He was 50-something, with a tousle of salt-and-pepper hair peeking out from the brim of his cowboy hat. He was dressed simply in blue jeans and a starched shirt, wearing a belt with a large silver buckle. He did not break his gaze on me, as he sipped slowly on a cup of coffee. I have never felt such an instant spark of connection. Suddenly, as our eyes met, I knew it. This man was to be my husband.", "label": "imagined", "group": "KN29R33B"}

They are driving unsafely but they are afraid of being written up by their bosses. The job wasn't always like it is now. The Postal Service has GPS now so they can track each employee all day. The postal worker is given a few minutes only to deliver a package and the majority of their workload consists of packages, not letters. Employees used to be able to stop and talk to their customers and they usually knew if anything was wrong. My husband even saved a customer's life once because she had cut herself so he wrapped her arm up while they waited for the ambulance. Now they aren't allowed to stop except to drop the mail quickly and get going again. More employees are falling, getting bit by dogs and having accidents because they are rushed.", "label": "retold", "group": "ENPEGMWF"}

The first friend I spent time with at her birthday dinner at a korean BBQ place, the second friend I spent time with at her house to watch a movie. Dinner at the BBQ place was super fun and I was most surprised to see a soju tower on the house when I showed up. It was a huge tower-like container that has a switch and when you open it, soju just comes flowing out. The price of it was more than $30 so I was really surprised to see the restaurant just gave it to us on the house. I was also surprised by how many people showed up. I hadn't checked who else was coming and I was pleasantly surprised to see some friends I hadn't seen in a while. This dinner was significant to me because my friend was turning 21, an age that is pretty important to a lot of teens. It wasn't as important to me, but it was to my friend because she is quite a heavy drinker, so that made it important to me too. I had a really good time during the dinner. I was anxious at first because I wasn't sure where I would be sitting. Since my friend invited a lot of people I knew it was pretty guaranteed I wouldn't be able to sit with her. But I ended up finding a lot of people I knew and had a good time catching up with them. Afterwards I met up wit my other friend to watch a movie. This event was significant to me as well because I hadn't seen this friend in a while, and I got to see the new place she moved out to. It was the first time she was finally living on her own, and it was nice to see her slowly going into adulthood more. I had a really good experience writing this because it made me feel all these happy feelings I felt when I was going to the party and to my friend's house.

My husband and I were overjoyed, doubly so when we found out it was twins. Around 8 weeks we were told that twin A was not growing very well and likely would not make it, but twin B was right on target. At 10 weeks we were told that twin A had passed away,  but twin B was very strong and perfect statistically speaking. At 12 weeks we went for a high level ultrasound to find out our remaining twins gender as well as see if all the anatomy was correct. We went in expecting good news as we do not have any type of genetic or chromosomal disorders in our families and we had made it to the 2nd trimester. We had told our parents a few days ahead of our appointment. During the ultrasound, the tech was very quiet. We asked her if she could tell just the gender and she said no. We asked for pictures and she did not want to give us any. Then she left the room quickly and a team of 4 doctors came in. The lead doctor explained that the baby had a large cystic hygroma as well as hydrops. They told us that hydrops babies almost never make it until birth - roughly 5% survive until birth and those that do can have severe issues such as spinal bifida, downs syndrome, heart defects, dwarfism, etc. They encouraged us that day to terminate the pregnancy, which was very difficult to even hear since we are Catholic. We went from being exceptionally happy to our world ending within just a few minutes. Neither one of us wanted to believe that this bad news was possible - we had already started discussing baby names even! We went home in a daze and spent the next few weeks mainly in bed crying, trying to decide what to do. When we went for our 15 week appointment, we found out the baby had passed away on its own, which required going through the labor and delivery process the next day. It doesn't seem possible or fair that we lost not just one, but TWO babies in the same pregnancy. It was the most traumatic event of both of our lives.

I was strapped to a table that is eventually raised to about 80 degrees. During this time, four people in the room monitored my vital signs such as blood pressure and pulse. By comparing what these two numbers do, they can diagnose certain conditions such as POTS. As time went on, I was not passing out. I began to be concerned that it would not happen. It seemed the PA got bored, because he crossed his arms and just stared as if I were exasperating him. Every once in a while I was asked if I was having my symptoms. At one point I heard him tell the nurse I would need a saline infusion even if nothing happened, which seemed a bit odd. I was sad that I was not passing out. For decades I have had this condition, and it seemed that I would not be diagnosed with something after all.

After the second time I said that, I remember coming to, to lying down on the table, and the nurse asking, \"How much of that do you remember?\" I said I remembered saying I felt odd, and she replied, \"Wow.\" I was so grateful I had fainted that I came to laughing and joking with them.

I feel so lucky to be alive and reflect on it often. It definitely made me appreciate my life a little more, especially when the mechanic was so surprised to see the car's condition and then us. I also discovered tired driving can be worse than drunk driving. Even if you aren't under the influence, tiredness impairs you. It's important to not be ignorant when behind the wheel. It's also important to not be aware, even if you aren't behind the wheel. It could take warning the driver verbally to save your lives or prevent an accident. We have concluded that we won't be going back again any time soon. It's not worth the trauma.", "label": "recalled", "group": "2TZ8SL3S"}

We rented a convertible Mustang, which was really fun because the weather was beautiful and having the top down made it feel like we were more a part of the magnificent scenery.  In fact, we never saw a single drop of Washington's famous rain during the four days we were there.  We even only got clouds for part of one day.  We stayed at a place called Rockwood Farm, which has \"Washington's most liked front gate on Instagram\", which sounds dumb, but the driveway really is something special to see.  The farm isn't really so much a farm as it is a log mansion sitting on several acres of land on the North Fork Snoqualmie river.  There was a playground on the property for kids.  Also, there was a heard of  elk that roamed the grounds and weren't particularly bothered by people.   Mt. Si loomed in the background.  We mostly spent time exploring the Snoqualmie area, but we also spent a little time in Seattle.  One day, we took the ferry from Seattle over to Poulsbo.  Seeing Mt.

The English countryside was so charming that it made me wish I could just move there. Madame Tussauds was very interesting. I wanted to stay there forever. Riding the London Eye was quite thrilling. I took so many pictures that I had to download them every night to make room on the camera for the next day. I had always imagined the English people as being kind of stuck up. I was quite surprised that our experiences were the opposite of that. Everyone was warm and friendly. I saw one section of London that reminded of a scene out of the movie Mary Poppins.

She had cancerous cells found in her ovary and it was a relatively simple and minor surgery. They had taken her back for her pre-op checks and everything seemed to be fine. They started her on anesthesia and that's when her heart stopped. They got her heart started again and the doctor came out to speak with me. He said it happens sometimes with patients and that they were going to postpone the surgery to do more tests and see how she does. They ran tests and it seemed to be a fluke that it happened since everything came back normal and healthy. A week later she had the surgery without any complications. When the doctor told me what happened, the world just stopped and I felt like everything was in slow motion. Until he said that she was alive and fine, I ran through all of the things that I would have to do as well as try to comprehend the loss of my best friend and mother. I had a panic attack set in and started crying and shaking. It took me about 30 minutes to be able to get my body under control and to get my emotions under control to go and see my mother.

Being a pizza delivery driver was one of the longest jobs I had ever held and it was a pretty relaxed job once I stopped stressing over how late the delivery may or may not be. When I told my father he was surprised asking me every few days, \"you're not scared?\" I honestly wasn't, I guess at the time I was more concerned about having enough money to last me during the schooling phase. So February after earning enough money to last me roughly two weeks (which by the way was a lot less than what I actually needed) I got on the greyhound to earn my place in this world. I had studied and earned my CLP (commercial learner's permit) while I did the odd jobs to get the money I needed for the trip. I arrived at night in a completely different hotel than was told I would be in and that frazzled me immediately. With literally no information about where I go next and when I decided to just go to sleep early and get on with it. Fast forward to the beginning of week two. This is where the fear sets in. The fear my father kept asking me if I felt 3 months ago had finally latched onto my heart and head. It was time to actually turn on and drive the truck to do my first backing maneuver. The first maneuver was actually pretty simple, just drive forward and back up.  Well it SOUNDS simple but it really isn't; the back of that 53 foot trailer wants to go in directions you didn't give it permission to go in. You had to learn to control the trailer and make sure it stays straight and doesn't continue to offtrack right or left. Eventually I got it down even though I genuinely felt I wasn't going to be able to do it. Then came the next maneuver which was offset parking. Take your trailer and move it to the very next spot. This took some time but eventually I got it after again thinking I wouldn't be able to do it. Then the next maneuver, parallel parking. Just thinking about parallel parking a truck still frazzles me to this day, but eventually I nailed it in five minutes, or so I thought. After practicing all three maneuvers till I got sick of them came test day. In my first station I had nailed all three maneuvers after much practice perfectly. In the last practice station I had trouble with parallel but ended up doing a prefect parallel right before I tested. Because my results had been inconsistent I wasn't exactly sure how I would test but long story short I ended up failing the parallel my first try during the test. I felt so defeated and extremely sad but I wasn't going to let it stop me considering I hated the thought of going back home with mom and dad.

Then I took my girlfriend to see it last night. The movie was about an event that was a fantasy and yet totally believable. The characters were sweet and lovely and they made you want to know what happened to them and you really cared about what happened. The music in the movie was so phenomenal and kept you on the edge of your seat. I also had acquired the tickets for a really good price. That made it more justifiable to see it so many times. I intend to buy the movie when it becomes available. I may see it again soon with my son who wants to see it too and has not done so yet. The movie just makes me happy when I see it because of the joyfulness. The way they overcome their challenges with love and understanding is so lovely. It makes you want to persevere in the things you love as well. The actors that portrayed the characters in the movie were remarkable. They were so realistic that you totally believed what was happening to them. They also were humorous and had many friends. Movies that include friendship and love are so rare nowadays and that was refreshing. The fact that they were not white Americans was surprising but surprisingly a very good choice. It was sweet but not syrupy sweet. It was a fantasy and yet a believable story. The story was just a remarkable way of showing perseverance and love with ordinary people. I hope that the movie academy of arts and sciences will consider it for some award. It was a brilliant concept and a wonderful story to impart to all ages.

My daughter who has had knee surgery was next to go down and my husband stayed back with her.  We ended up only going to he top of the Alum Cave trail because it was another 5.5 miles to the top and we couldn't not in good conciense make our hiking companions wait on us to complete the entire hike.

We rented a huge log cabin in the mountains that included pin ball machines, old school video games, a pool table, swimming pool, hot tub, and large enough areas that all of us could sit around and talk. This vacation was especially memorable because my parents who are in their 70's, were able to spend time with all 5 of their grandchildren, son-in-law, nephew, married in relatives, and myself, their oldest daughter. We spent a lot of time laughing and cooking together. We would sit out on the balcony and look at the breathtaking views. We were very high up on the mountain and the drive up was pretty scary at times, LOL, yet that provided us with a lot of pictures and memories that will last forever. There were a few times that we went into the city to shop, go out to eat, and explore what the Smokey Mountains had to offer. One evening we went to a new area where there is a huge farris wheel. While I personally would not go on it, several of my family members did, and when they were at the top they took awesome pictures. My nephew said, holy crap, that thing is tall. The way he said it was so funny. He is a little guy so seeing him look at the farris wheel and understand the height of it was cool. Every morning my husband and son-in-law would go fishing. One day they brought back Trout. After they cleaned the fish my son-in-law put it on the grill and cooked it for anyone who wanted some. The first batch of fish was excellent and everyone ate it. By this time everyone was full. He still had one more fish that he had to cook. As I was eating this fish I noticed that it didn't entirely look done. I picked at it a few more times. That evening we all sat around the cabin talking and playing games. We had our telescope there so we were able to look at the stars at night and find the constellations. After everyone went to bed, I woke up around midnight thinking I was dying. Nope, FOOD POISONING!!! I was up for several hours becoming best friends with the porcelain god.

I feel slightly relieved by this since that means if something does happen between us it won't be an awkward office romance, but at the same time I was a bit upset because she was only here for a week. I grab myself a cookie and offer her one to go with the coffee she is drinking. She accepts. Seeing as how it's Thursday and she will be done with her training seminar tomorrow, I decide to go for broke and do something I normally never do. I just straight up ask her if she would like to grab some dinner sometime with me. She smiles and gives me her phone number and tells me to text her later so we can work something out. I add her number and smile and tell her I should probably get back to work, but if she needs any more help finding other condiments to come find me at my desk and I'll be happy to help. She laughs and says she will be looking for my text. I go back to my desk and resume writing the email, but this time in a much better mood.", "label": "imagined", "group": "8SZ60C1E"}

His father and I drove him down last evening and we stayed at the local Hilton.  He's not too old, yet, to be tickled with the hotel swimming pool.  We also found an all-you-can-eat buffet near there that had chicken tenders and french fries.  He can still eat so much!  It's no wonder he's over 6 feet tall!  Best of all, Allie came home from college just to join us and surprised him.  The way his face lit up as he caught sight of her made this mother's heart just sing.  I'm so glad they're growing closer to each other as they get older.  I'm still amazed they never actually killed each other growing up.  I think that Michael is giving serious consideration about going into wildlife conservation as his college major.  I've noticed him taking a bigger interest in his biology class and he's been spending more time volunteering at the animal shelter, too.  They're just growing up way too quickly.

Until, that is, four weeks ago, when a most peculiar accident set into motion a series of events that has forever altered my life. I was turning left onto Broadway from Franklin Ave, when this total dill-weed on an electric scooter appeared outta nowhere and ran into my side-view mirror. I rolled down the window and hollered, \"Watch where you're going, you total dill-weed! The street is for cars!\" but she didn't seem to hear me. However, as I was angrily watching her e-scoot away, I rear-ended the car in front of me. The woman who was driving flung open her door and approached my car. I cut an intimidating figure, however, and when I exited my vehicle she quickly choked on her words at the sight of my 5' 4\", 255 pound shadow bearing down on her. \"Lady,\" I said, \"Where'd you learn how to drive? Dukes of Hazzard reruns?\" That's when I realized she didn't understand a word I was saying. My daughter, who happened to be with me at the time, recognized her peculiar language, so I instructed her to give this woman a serious dressing down. \"No, dad,\" she said, \"this accident was clearly your fault. And besides, I think I recognize that bumper sticker.\" The woman had a very large Smurfs bumper sticker, which was now crumpled from the impact of the accident. My daughter asked her some questions and determined the woman to be the mother of her childhood friend, Tabby. They hadn't seen each other in some twenty odd years. The woman was on her way to visit Tabby in a mental institute, and my daughter asked if she could tag along. I objected at first, because I don't want my daughter hanging around crazy drivers with Smurfs bumper stickers, but my daughter winked at me and whispered, \"I'll make sure the insurance company doesn't get involved, here. I promise, dad.\" What a strange coincidence. And what a great daughter.", "label": "imagined", "group": "7W36KA43"}

I can't say how many times I thought about quitting while I was in the marathon because I lost count. I reminded myself that I had gone all year training and never quit. I reminded myself that I had already did a practice run and did fairly well, without quitting. I knew I had prepared, and hydrated and gave my body its needed nutrition and rest.

He saw me and drove over to where I was at and pick me up. I got back to my hotel safely but I was pretty shaken because I knew things were going to go badly if that small gang caught up with me.

Two years later we are still in the same financial situation. In the beginning of July I decided that I wanted to do something fun for my daughter's birthday. So, I began using MTurk to make a little extra money. I began working harder everyday to make the money to take my family to the Zoo. After I saved a little of the money I began making plans. Telling my husband and his family of what I wanted to do. Unfortunately my husband had to work on her birthday and the next week, so we pushed the date to the first Saturday in August. Over the next month I was determined to do this for my family. Four days before my planned event, my husband and I began to looked at our finances. We realized that July had been a hard month financially for us. We did not have enough to pay rent for our one bedroom apartment. With much disappointment I decided to cancel the Zoo trip and used the money I saved for rent. And through ever financial means we had, we made enough money to pay our rent. That Saturday I sat at home, enjoying the day with my family. To my surprise I got a call from my Mother-In-law. She told me to come to her house with our daughter and we were going to the zoo.

The lines for the rides were extremely long due to the park being packed for the holidays, as well as the new Star Wars ride opening. Unfortunately I did not get to ride Rise of the Resistance because we had too many little children with us who were afraid. Instead we rode many of the rides in Fantasyland, which I love due to the nostalgic feelings of reminiscing about visiting the theme park when I was a young child. We also spent quite a bit of time shopping in Disney Springs. My nieces and nephews all had to buy various Mickey Mouse ears, which were adorable and holiday-themed. We also enjoyed just walking through all of the different shops to see the unique items they might have. I ended up buying a piece of jewelry for myself, which I love and am wearing right now! We ate dinner at Planet Hollywood, which has been another favorite of mine since I was a child and I have many good memories of eating at this restaurant in different areas of the United States.

It was a really long day at work, with an early afternoon meeting that stretched well past dinner time.  By the time I was leaving work, I was physically and emotionally worn out on top of being very hungry.  I have a long commute home, it was raining, and I heard that traffic was particularly heavy for that time of night.  I decided to drive straight home and eat dinner at home instead of stopping.  As I entered the highway, the rain had started to come down almost torrentially, it was really difficult to see.  Immediately, I could tell that the driver in front of me was struggling.  She was going very slowly and seemed to be riding the white line.  As we neared where the traffic was supposed to pick up, she twice nearly drove off the side of the road.  I was worried about her, but also about my safety because her driving was unpredictable.  I wanted to pass her at my first opportunity, but I slowed down and gave myself some room in the meantime.  Once I could see the red brake lights from the traffic jam in front of us, I started to feel a little better because I knew the driver in front of me would have to stop and the traffic jam would keep her safe for a while.  I couldn't believe it when, just before we reached the traffic jame, she suddenly sped up and took a hard right turn right off the road and into the woods.  I swear I could hear her scream from the woods as I drove by.  I never saw myself as someone who would stopped to help in this situation, but something came over me and I just pulled over without thinking.  I ran into the woods and the scene was horrible.  The driver was an elderly woman and her small car was upside down and crunched really badly.  She was screaming in pain and I could tell she was really bloody.  I quickly called 911 and broke down the scene before I took a real hard look into the car.  The woman was in rough condition, couldn't move because the car was upside down, and she seemed absolutely terrified.  I knew I couldn't really help her, but my heart was breaking for her.  I laid down on the ground and held the woman's hand.  I tried to talk calmly with her until the ambulance and rescue workers came.  She begged to hold my hand again after she was removed.  I ended up riding with her in the ambulance until we got her to the hospital and she was sedated.", "label": "recalled", "group": "JIQJKM6H"}

Nursing care is not offered, nor does this kind of facility have legal authority to give skilled nursing care. If a nurse is on staff, the nurse's role is limited to assessment and directing the resident assistants. Some assisted living facilities also have a separate nursing home wing or section, and that requires a different license to be a skilled nursing facility. If there is an emergency, no one will not offer emergency care. It is difficult to care for, or needs frequent treatment for chronic conditions, the assisted living facility may not accept them. A doctor has to verify that they are suitable by signing a form. On top of that, the facility does its own assessment to see if the prospective resident is a fit for their community. No one is watching over your loved one 24/7. Help is available, but your aging parent will not have a personal attendant noting their every move. Someone will check on them daily and if they don't show up for meals, someone will notice. If medications are being given out by the attendant (\"med tech\") every day or more than once a day, that person will notice if something is wrong. They help with basics but should not be expected to diagnose, or offer anything other than exactly the medications on the resident's list. They may ask the nurse to check on a resident. These homes offer an enriched social environment. There are meals in common and a chance to socialize, activities offered, and entertainment of various kinds. Some communities offer classes. Residents have a way to call someone if there is a problem. If they're not feeling well, an assistant can be summoned by either pulling a cord, a call bell, or pressing a button. The proximity of attention to an aging parent's needs is one of the best ways to assuage the worries of adult children. The actual cost of assisted living may not be fully understood when you size up a place under consideration. You may be quoted the price for the rent of the apartment. The cost is usually more than the rent, as your loved one must also pay many other charges. If help is needed with bathing, for example, there is an additional cost for that.Mom can't remember to take her pills? \"Medication management\" can be a huge cost on top of the basic rent.", "label": "imagined", "group": "02HVXZKX"}

All of the adults were very close in college, but have drifted apart in the recent years moving to different states. It was important to me because while I enjoy meeting with my two best friends from college, our families have now started to grow closer as well.  Each family has two children, and I enjoyed seeing my daughters become closer friends with the other children.  The children planned their own games, enjoyed swimming in the lake, and created a rope-swing off of the dock.  The most meaningful moments to me were seeing our children develop a similar friendship to what I had with the two other Dads who were present that weekend. The children wanted to keep in contact upon leaving, which has not happened before.  They planned to \"borrow\" phones from their parents so that they could text and call each other throughout the summer.  They even planned another trip for the three families to an amusement part later this fall. The children are now growing old enough that they can experience lake activities without the adults, giving us more time for reflection and fun.

I had to take her to the emergency room in a point when she throw up 7 times in a row.  After testing everything and staying in the hospital for 40 days, doctor wanted to starts dialysis on her. I was not sure if I was making the right choice as it seems like doctors were trying to force dialysis on her. Now she is on dialysis and I am still wondering if I made the best choice for her, sometimes it seems like she is a money making machine for the dialysis center. Every time I take her to the center and I look around I doubt the doctor decision. The other day there were a social worker who works there said the same thing. Seems like I am giving them a permanent income source. I wish there are some alternative to the dialysis. They are working on artificial kidney. I hope it is available in the market soon.

I ate outside as it was sunny and cool at 7am and wanted to enjoy the view.  Everything was going perfect until the phone call.  I received a call from my boss asking if I had a few minutes to talk.  I said, \"of course\" thinking she might be asking me to work overtime one day next week, or possibly come in later that day.  That's when things went sour.  My boss advised me that he was not happy with the quality of my work.  He said that he is getting pressure from upper management and that he needed to put more pressure on his staff.  He said if I did not clean up my act that I would be out of a job within a couple weeks.  He was blunt and quick with the conversation and hung up before I could ask him any questions.  Just like that my perfect day took a turn for the worst.  I immediately starting thinking about my mounting bills and student loans.  I could feel my blood flowing through my arms and my chest.  I started to sweat as I thought about my rent, car loan, student loan, insurance cost and utility bills.  Before I even knew what was going on, I was slouched in my chair and having a panic attack.  I thought I was going to faint.  I was sweating and breathing heavily.  I ran to get a glass of water and was shaking and could barely drink it.  I called my mom to come over right away.  5 minutes felt like 5 hours as I thought about the mounting costs of going to the hospital.  The bills and cost of medication to help me through this time were going to pile up.

We hit the road, and arrived at the park around 10:30 AM, which was good, because we wanted to get there when the gates opened at 10:30 AM. We found a parking spot and everyone got out to apply sunscreen, and gather their accessories for swimming in Soak Zone and the lunch we had packed for the day. We headed into the park, and were immediately amazed by the number of rides for children tat were available. The park layout was sprawling and went off into the woods in seemingly all directions. The kids were overwhelmed with excitement, and started feverishly discussing and pointing to where we would head first. We spent a few hours riding various rides: the train, a rope climb, ball pit, and walked through Storybook Forest. All the attractions were amazing! It was now lunch time, so we stopped at a pavilion to eat lunch and get a break from the hot, summer sun.  Then we headed to Soak Zone to cool off. We spent the rest of the day riding watersides, in the wave pool, the lazy river, and enjoying each other's company. Before we knew it, it was 6 PM and Soak Zone was closing, so we left to grab a bite to eat, and headed home. It was an amazing experience, and I can see why Idlewild and Soak Zone is rated the #1 Children's amusement park in the world.", "label": "recalled", "group": "7ABKP8U0"}

We had planned a week long vacation to the beach, travelling from Ohio in order to spend time with my family, including my parents and brother, and my wife's parents, and our 2 children.  After having fun for 4 days, my father in law awoke Thursday morning complaining of some pain in his jaw and heartburn.  My father in law and his wife felt that they should conservatively go to the hospital to get checked out.  Unfortunately, a blood test returned with slightly elevated enzyme numbers, meaning some minor heart damage may have occurred.  No problem we though, just a few more tests and a ruined day of vacation.  Well, after heart catheter, the really bad news came in.  My father in law would need quadruple bypass surgery immediately.  They scheduled him for surgery Monday morning, and he would have to stay in Myrtle Beach for another few weeks after the surgery until he was allowed to fly home.  What I will remember the most is visiting my father in law on Friday morning at the hospital and letting him visit with his grandchildren.  He was so stone faced and obviously scared and in mental anguish.  I gave him a hug goodbye, since I had to drive my kids home on Saturday, and he was in tears.  It was very painful to witness that.  Fortunately, my wife was going to stay with her mom and dad for a few more days to get through the surgery and help any way she could.  In excellent news, my father in law had a perfect surgery and is now recovering getting stronger every day.  The whole sequence of events is a good reminder to take life one day at a time, and appreciate all that we are given.

Every 'last game' gets significantly harder as i know that each one brings closer my eventual last game forever.

Even through all the losing, baseball is still near and dear to my heart. I have an enormous passion for the game and losing will not diminish that at all. Im still looking forward to next season with just as much excitement and anticipation as my previous years. I can only hope that our young squad will return and show growth. In the past few years it feels like each year we lose a couple of our core players. Those losses are tough because good players are hard to replace. You hope that the few new people that you acquire will step up and fill those roles but it cant be counted on with certainty. It has gotten significantly harder to get to the games. One hindrance is distance, after moving a little further away it becomes daunting to drive 45+ minutes one way to get to a game after working all day.

While I've always been a person who believe in spirits and energy living beyond death, someone actually communicating in real time with someone I'd lost was not something I fully believed in. I have to admit that going into the session, my expectations were fairly low. However, it didn't take more than 10 minutes for my entire outlook to change. After telling the medium who it was I wanted to speak to, they kicked off the process to communicate with them. Without going into too much detail, I can say that within the first few minutes of the conversation, I was sure I was speaking to my friend. One thing that the medium said caused me to burst into tears\u2014my friend knew of the symbol we had created for her after her death.

I ended up breaking my ankle in that accident which caused me a lot of issues. I basically had to learn how to walk again. after spending almost all of my time being alive walking and running that had came to a halt. I couldn't do those things anymore it was hard for me to do. Learning how to walk again after a personal tragedy is no small feat. It's crazy to think maybe one day this could happen. It changes your mindset and makes you see things in a whole new way. I know now to be carefull and stay safe at all times. I couldn't imagine having to go through this again.", "label": "imagined", "group": "6WIOM0WF"}

It was such a beautiful day, and I was & still am so happy that she found her person. But I can't help but feel a bit of residual stress as I think over how I almost ruined it for her. Maybe that's dramatic, but I felt like I was ruining things when I spilled my champagne down the front of my bridesmaid's gown when she was counting on me to just show up and be presentable. Of course,  she wasn't mad at me in the end (maybe that's because we got it cleaned up), but the stress and embarrassment I felt was crazy. I haven't been to many big events like that lately, and I was freaking out. As if standing up in front of all those people wasn't enough pressure. Now, I thought, I'd have to either do it with a giant wet stain down my front, or change and be the only person in the wedding party wearing old, ripped jeans. I even thought, for a moment, about just sitting the whole thing out. But of course, that would've also ruined it because of how we'd rehearsed everything and I had to walk with a groomsman. Luckily, our wonderful grandma made it to the wedding that day. Leave it to an old-timer to know all the secret tricks for getting stains out. It took her no time at all to make my dress good as new, and the weight just instantly lifted off my chest. I know it's probably not as big of a deal as I make it out to be, but I've always been prone to anxiety. My cousin is so important to me and I just couldn't stand the thought of ruining her big day. She's waited so long for it. Thankfully, it all went according to plan and she's got perfect, champagne-stain-free photos to look back on and remember forever.

The other issue she had was with overturning. She was nervous and asked a lot of questions, but it was obvious that she really wanted to learn. It was a great time between the two of us. It reminded me of when my mother, who passed away ten years ago, would take me to the parking lot of my high school to teach me to drive. I can remember how nervous she was. If I came within fifty feet of a parked car, she would tell me to slow down. It also reminded me of when my daughter was first born.

The week of the wedding or families were together and getting along well. The day of the wedding was perfect and we both agree we wouldn't want anything different. We opted out of a traditional honeymoon, well it was already a big logistical debacle anyway. Excited to begin our life we discussed our future and for me living away from my home that I have known for so long. Thats when I leaned the truth, she was not amazing. She was not a post grad student working towards a medical degree. She was once but not now, she is not amazing in that sense but she is my beautiful and loving wife. I am happy to say that together we have rekindled her excitement of achieving her dream of medicine and i will one day be married to a beast loving SUPER Amazing woman.", "label": "imagined", "group": "F696V1Q6"}

I had wanted to do this hike for many years and had researched it quite a bit. I knew it was going to be difficult but I had no idea how much so. We started early in the morning and for about four hours we just kept climbing up higher and higher. It was even more difficult because there was loose rocks under us for much of it. Every time we reached what we thought was the top, another long uphill awaited us. Finally after what I figured was another false top, we came up and it was as though we were at the top of the world. There below us spreading for 360 degrees were what seemed like thousands of craggly mountain peaks. It was like something from Lord of the Rings. We both started to cry it was so beautiful. There was more crazy hiking to do, however, as we had to use ropes that had been attached to the mountain during World War I to transverse some cliffs and small waterfalls. That was the most difficult part for my wife, and I was so proud of her that she did it. I think she suprised herself. It was really one of the most memorable experiences of our lives.

I really love children, and with my background in pediatric nursing, I thought I would do a good job representing the abused and unloved ones in court. Well, as it happens, I did too good a job. My first child to represent was a four year old girl who had been physically abused by her drug addicted parents. My heart went out to this beautiful child, and I just resented her parents so much. I really bonded with her when we were meeting prior to the court date. Even though she is only four, I really could feel her emotional pain and despair from being raised by parents who loved drugs more than her. I spoke for her at the custody trial in which I was attempting to get her away from her parents and into foster care. I guess I really was able to let the judge understand the girl's despair and unending pain she suffers in her home, because the judge did take the child away from her parents. He granted custody to me. The judge said that it was clear the child had emotional and behavioral issues, and also clear that she had formed a strong bond with me. I was to be her foster parent. I was in total shock. I am glad to be an advocate, but honestly just want to focus on my career, and have no intention of having children right now. I guess God has other plans, though, because the girl went home with me that day after court. She and I have been living together for about 3 months now, and I am loving every minute of it. Every day, I feel like I learn something new about being a parent and a friend. I am able to see this child blossom into a beautiful healthy, well adjusted child, and I know I am the reason for that.

I began to wonder whether I would be able to refrain from being overly emotional if we actually met in real life because looking at her would remain me so much of my husband. I miss him dearly and I hope that this new relationship and connection with his daughter will bring me comfort and peace in knowing that some part of him still lives through her.

I live in the most rural area I've ever seen in my life after growing up in the suburbs of Philadelphia. Talk about culture shock. But anyway, the last time I'd visited Pennsylvania, she had talked about doing an Escape Room as a team building thing for work and I expressed how much I wanted to try one of those. So even though I didn't know what I wanted to do after my birthday, my mom found an Escape Room in a nearby city. She booked it and we went. So this being my first Escape Room, I had no idea what to expect. Mom sent me the list of the \"scenarios\" and said we should do an easier one since it was my first, but the one that struck my fancy was the one where I was supposed to be an FBI agent - the hardest one. I said, \"I hear what you're saying, but I want to be an FBI agent!\" So that's the one we did. And we did really well. At first there were so many different things that could be puzzle pieces that I was literally running from corner to corner wondering where to start. That took more time than it needed to, but once the first puzzle got solved it was pretty smooth sailing. We were in the room with three teenagers who seemed a little shy. Having worked retail, I tried to introduce myself and get their names because - you know, team building. It took a little while for them to really start engaging with us.  The whole thing went by in a blur and I honestly barely remember the entire process, I just know I had a great time and that we got the very, very last piece of the puzzle - a book with the code to unlock the door - when the clock was at 30 seconds. At this point, we weren't thinking as much as we should have been anymore and all but ignored the telling part of the clue that revealed the page of the book the code would be on. I was proud for almost getting out though, I think we definitely would have done if we didn't get frantic. Afterwards my husband told me that he loved seeing me like that. I had no idea what he was talking about. \"You were so amazing in there, you took charge of the situation and told people what you thought and I loved it.\" I didn't realize how naturally I'd fallen back into my Assistant Manager role where I knew what to do and how it needed to get done, but it felt really good.

My baby girl is going to be nine months older than her nephew/niece. This pregnancy was not so much a surprise as I didn't think it would happen. I figured I was too old to get pregnant, so my husband and I weren't as careful as we should have been. After my son was born three years ago, I secretly longed for another baby. I really hoped I would have one more girl, so I was not upset when I got pregnant. The pregnancy was the hardest one yet. Maybe because I'm a lot older or maybe because I gained 50 pounds. Maybe because I had three other children, ages 8 and younger. I didn't want to tell anyone about the pregnancy, first because I thought something ba would happen or something might be wrong with the baby. Second, I was embarrassed about having a baby at my age and because she would be number five. We didn't tell family until 22 weeks and everyone else until 27 weeks. I have a little cheated that I didn't celebrate this pregnancy or baby more. That time is gone and I'll never get it back.", "label": "recalled", "group": "RIHD616R"}

I have always been a Beatles fan and Paul is my absolute favorite. My husband is not a rock music fan so this gesture was truly meaningful me as I knew he would go to the concert, but it may not be his favorite way to spend an evening. We also lost part of our income last year so this was truly a splurge for us. When the evening finally came we found babysitters for our kids and made the trip across town for dinner and then to the show. It was our first time visiting this particular venue so it was definitely an adventure getting there and figuring out parking. We had gotten there early so we had a chance to just sit and relax before the concert started. And then there was about a 30 minute delay to the actual concert. Once the concert started though I knew that everything we had gone through to get there had been worth it. I'm not too proud to say that I teared up when Paul took the stage. He sang a lot of my favorites and the stage was lit up with images of him with the Beatles, Wings, and his later solo career. There was even a huge fireworks display that shook the entire stadium. I clapped, yelled, and sang along and my husband also seemed to have a great time. This might have been the best birthday present ever.

I had also lost fairly decisively at a tournament in February - I needed redemption. I prepared in several different ways. First, I needed to lose about 5 pounds. This takes a good amount of self-discipline, as your body has a hard time readjusting to a caloric deficit. I removed carbs and also just ate less in general, eating a minimum of protein and veggies necessary. I lost about 7 pounds total and was in great shape. My cardio was another issue. I needed to boost my stamina, as in my previous competition I had biked vigorously but still fatigued. My new strategy was to spar at other gyms as often as I could. Fighting someone unfamiliar to you will make you more competitive and more uneasy, which is exactly what a tournament is. The tournament itself was almost disappointing, as it seemed my opponents did not provide enough of a challenge. Who you fight on the day of will always be random.

Over the next couple of weeks and months, we tried to encourage her to fight and remain strong. She first started with chemotherapy, which was not doing her much good. She then opted to have a surgery. The surgery ended up been more complicated than we expected, but after all the surgeries, she continued chemo. At this point we thought she was in a good place, and that she was recovering. A few weeks later she died.

Every now and then I see someone who looks like the mugger. It startles me every time. Even if its in broad daylight or in some big store with dozens of other people in it. I know this is insane but I think he may be following me, maybe lying in wait to do it all over again. And this I really hate, I used to have no problem with chatting up people in public, no problem with making new friends, but now I try to avoid it all costs. I just walk around with a hoodie up and headphones in, hoping no one notices me or walks towards me or anything like that.  I'm pretty much running when in public just so some other mugger will have less of a chance to exploit me. I haven't worn what I was wearing that night again. Not even the shoes. I should probably just throw all that clothing away, even seeing it sitting in the corner of the room is too much. It just brings up those memories all over that run and run like a video stuck on repeat. I'm not sure if I should donate it to goodwill or something - I don't know why I find myself thinking like this, but it's almost like everything to do with that night is tainted. Why should I give something that's been ruined like that to someone in need? I'm actually thinking of moving out of the city now. If something like this happens again I just couldn't handle it.

I don't like being the center of attention, so I make sure to take my birthday reminder off of Facebook and I definitely don't mention that my birthday is coming up to friends or family. I guess I took it for granted that most people I cared about just happened to keep it locked away and ready for use when it came up every year. I think it also doesn't help that I'm not a kid anymore. Anyway, this year no one really remembered except for my girlfriend and my mom. It's easy for my girlfriend since her mom and I share the same birthday, and my mom had the traumatic experience of giving birth to me so she probably couldn't forget it even if she wanted to. I have to admit that I was disappointed to learn that neither my brothers or my closest friends hadn't remembered on their own. It stung deeply as the day came to a close, the little hope I had dwindling as time ticked on. As time has passed I've realized that it wasn't so bad. I spent the evening with my mom and had dinner with her at a restaurant (her treat, of course). We spent the time enjoying each others company and simply talking. I know it sounds typical and boring, but I treasure that memory now. I spent my birthday celebrating it with the one person who probably cares the most about that day. I was able to share at least one of my birthdays with only one other person and it made it all the more special to me and them. So, that's pretty much it. My birthday was almost forgotten and now I'm glad for it.", "label": "imagined", "group": "FVGISER4"}

Jessica came first into the world \"SIX POUNDS THREE OUNCES!\" I remember the doctor yelling as everyone oohed and awed and for a moment that was the happiest moment of my life. However life has a strange way of throwing us for a loop at the worst times...sometimes before we even get a chance to know it.

A look of shock and terror quickly infected the rooms before they whisked her away without explanation. It was in actuality only ten minutes before we heard from anyone who knew what was going on, but it felt like hours. \"Joanna has a problem with her lungs. It will take some time, but we are confident we will be able to take care of her\" the doctors reassured us. We knew it was going to be a long road ahead of us.

Our last loss was a third trimester loss, two days before my due date. Everything looked great through the pregnancy and I thought \"this is it, finally! we made it to the end safely\", until those dreams were shattered just as quickly as they pregnancy progressed. We discovered at a routine non stress test that the baby had no heartbeat and had passed from a cord accident. Even though each loss prior to this had been difficult, this was the worst. My entire life went dark and I no longer cared about anything. I can truly say this was darkest moment in my life. After months of suffering, my husband took me on a vacation to help me renew my spirit and mood, and surprise, we ended up getting pregnant on this trip. I felt so detached during this pregnancy and considered terminating as I was so certain it was going to end badly again. It is my pleasure to say it did not.

He was supposed to come home a few days before but it got changed and it was so frustrating. His new time was going to be two in the morning and I remember being so exhausted. I woke my son up literally as I was walking out the door. He was such a trooper, while we waited for daddy he played with a little American flag and just crawled around. The second we seen him I started crying, and my son could not stop starring at him. I was so nervous about how our son was going to react to him. He was so young when he left and now almost a year old and had established fears. He was very nervous around men since he was not around many with his father being gone. But he went to his daddy like he knew exactly who he was and nothing made me happier than that moment.  We have been through deployments before but this was our first one with a child. This was a whole different experience that you could only understand if you have been through it. I am so thankful for my husband and everything he does for our family. Often when I think about him being gone and when he comes home I just think about myself and how I struggled and how I felt. I forget to think about him and how he is struggling.

I bought my condo last year and the courtyard was one thing I had always wanted and had based my purchase on it. I've taken horticulture in college so I'm pretty knowledgeable about how to do it. About 4 years before I purchased the condo, previous owners had hired a landscape company to decorate it with a flowering tree, plants, pond and black river rock stone as mulch. They sold the condo to a retired woman a year later and she never even pulled one weed. So when I bought it, it was an overgrown jungle. My first step was pulling out weeds and dead bushes. My next step, which took about 3 months, was pulling out all the river rock from about 1 foot down in the dirt. From rain and other weather, the rocks had sunken down through the landscape fabric and underneath all the weeds. Every day, I spent 15-30 minutes overturning the dirt, one shovel scoop at a time, then pulling each rock out (from 1 in. to 4 inches wide) and tossing them into huge plastic bins in the garage. I then drew out a new landscape plan, bought the plants, dug the holes and planted them. To my surprise, I called a pond company and I was able to afford their services of rebuilding my broken down pond and adding a filter, pump and some underwater plants. After that was all done, I called a landscape company to drag the bins out of the garage, lay down new landscape fabric and all those black rocks. I also brought out my garden decor, added fish to the pond, added some smaller plants to decorative pots and finally stood back to look at my work. I can't believe how beautiful it is and my neighbors also love it. It's a soothing place to come out to several times a day for relaxation.", "label": "recalled", "group": "TTBBJ41R"}

I was uneasy about the costume I had selected since I had not really put in too much effort or time into it. I was dressed up as John Snow from Game of Thrones. I have the long black hair and the facial hair naturally so that was a plus. What I was uneasy about was the clothing. I had visited a Thrift Store two days before the event and had hurriedly pieced together a  \"John Snow costume\". I arrived about an hour before the party officially started to help my friend with last minute items. I was \"in between\" girlfriends so was going as \"a single guy\". To my surprise, I met a girl with incredible inner and outer beauty and a great spirit. Her name was Elyse and was my friend's cousin.  Elyse and I were exchanging looks and glances from across the room with curiosity or possibly interest in each other. I hesitated in interacting with Elyse, the way I really wanted to, since I felt my John Snow costume looked \"cheap\". I was self-conscious due to the costume so only interacted with Elyse a couple of times. I interacted with everybody else but Elyse seemed to be the one I wanted to get to know better. I knew then that it was because I had a serious interest in her and wanted to make a good impression. The evening progressed and I did manage to dance with Elyse once. One of our co-workers ended up talking with Elyse a lot and danced with her several times. The party ended and everybody went home. I saw my co-worker and Elyse talking and walking together and I knew then that I had hesitated due to a lack of self-confidence created by my \"cheap\" John Snow costume. Elyse ended up dating my co-worker for about 2-3 months but they never really \"clicked\". I ended up dating a great girl I met at an NFL Game House Party in November and have been with her since. I still think about Elyse but more importantly, I think about my hesitation to really be myself that night, as I typically am, and loosing an opportunity of dating \"the women that caught my eye and brightened my spirit\" on that memorable Halloween House Party night.

My friends and I had done research a week or two before we left so we knew which excursions we wanted to take.   My favorite excursion was when we toured some ancient ruins which showed the way that the indigenous people pf Mexico originally lived.   I learned that in these cultures, it was not uncommon for the tribesman to run barefoot from one village to the next - which was sometimes as much as 50 miles.  It was amazing to learn how this activity evolved the culture into these super-athletes who had amazing endurance and stamina.    Another favorite excursion was a tour of a real Mexican plant where authentic Mexican food is made.  After the tour, my friends and I ate an amazing meal of true authentic Mexican food that was out of this world.  At the end of the meal, a mariachi band came over to serenade me with an authentic rendition of \"Happy Birthday\"!  I thanked my friends for setting up this amazing surprise.   Another favorite excursion was our trip out to a Mexican ranching farm.   We learned about some of the differences between ranch farming in the U.S. as compared to Mexico.   I was impressed with the dedication and commitment that Mexican ranch farmers have to make to succeed in this business due to the hot climate and dusty terrain.

My niece was there of course as well as my daughter and some close friends. I didn't care for the food at the restaurant, but, that wasn't the reason that we gathered, so it didn't matter. It was a hot day, and we walked from the restaurant to the church (hard for me because I recently had knee surgeries). I made sun catchers (because my sister loved the sun)  for everyone as well as a box in which we all wrote memories of my sister and placed them in the box. The sun catchers actually made a few people cry.  What surprised me is that it seemed like we didn't talk about my sister all that much. I mean the mood was somber, and we all knew why we were there, but, it became a little bit awkward. It was good to see everyone, and we are going to do it every year. She had a hard life and it was suicide. I wish I'd have been closer to  her at the end, and maybe I could have prevented what happened.", "label": "retold", "group": "KRTZBE9O"}

However, he knew about all of my interests such as sports and video games so by the end of the day I decided he was cool. The more we met he showed me how to channel how I was feeling that caused me to get into trouble into productive activities like playing sports or drawing. I followed his instructions and I started getting into less trouble. It even got to the point where I completely stopped getting into trouble. He had additional effects on me because he gave me more confidence in myself so I did better at school too. Also, my friends felt safer around me because I wasn't as reckless as before.

First, I quit my job the day before Thanksgiving break. I cried when I talked with my friend in HR. I FINALLY purchased my rollator. This was a huge act of acceptance, as I had fought doing this. The rollator sat in my truck for 2 weeks, never used. I refused to bring it into my home. I felt I didn't need it inside. I simply did NOT want to use it. One day I fell twice inside my home. That same day I was so out of balance, bouncing around,  hitting walls, etc. So, I asked my husband to go get it.  Eagerly, I began to use it that day. I was okay with it as I definitely needed this aid at the time. A few days later when I wasn't as out of balance I stopped using it. Then my balance went crazy again. I bounced around, not using the rollator. My husband put it in front of me. Now, I can happily say I am using my rollator in my home whenever I need it. I view this aid as my friend now. Once I order a basket for the front, it will be even more useful to me. I have been stubborn about using this, but now I am at peace with it.

Overall, things have been going smoothly, but I am still prone to worry that something might be amiss with the baby. This is particularly due to the fact that it is difficult to know what is going on inside, especially in the early months. As my pregnancy progressed, I was eagerly waiting for the moment when I would begin to feel the baby move. This didn't happen as early as something of the books indicated it might, which lead to worry. Eventually, though, I began to feel fluttering movements that seemed different from other sensations I had experienced. I became fairly confident these movements were the baby, but it was still easy to doubt myself. Two weeks of this mix of confidence and doubt was relieved one night, though.  I felt some kicks (at least what I hoped were kicks), and I encourage my husband to feel my belly. It was doubtful if he could feel anything yet, as the doctor indicated it might be awhile before anyone else could sense movement, but he felt something. In that moment, his face lit up with excitement, especially as the baby kept kicking, affirming what he was feeling. He held up a finger every time he felt something, and I confirmed that I felt movement simultaneously. It was an incredibly joyful moment for us. It left us feeling close and connected, both with each other, and with the baby. Additionally, it made me feel safe and secure knowing that the movement I had been feeling wasn't entirely in my own head. This was a beautiful moment in our relationship and in my pregnancy.", "label": "recalled", "group": "UP0PX9DW"}

My family and I typically vacation with my sister and her family.  This year was no different.  We rent a big, 15 passenger van and all 10 of us went to Seaside, Florida together.  We left early in the morning and got at our beach house late that evening.  This was such a memorable vacation, yet the most relaxing that we have taken with my sister and her family.  I have always envisioned vacationing with my sister, realizing that the day will come that my niece and nephew will graduate and family vacations such as this will be a thing of the past.  We played at the beach most days (basically there for 5-6 hrs each day) and just relaxed watching our children play in the ocean, build sandcastles and ride innertubes.  We would drive to Destin and Panama City and tour the city, walk on the pier, eat and shop.  The last time we were in Florida, my youngest was 8 months old, so this was fun to see her reaction to the ocean this time around.  Time passes so quickly, both years and on vacation.  The time you spend together is something so valuable that you can't get that back once its gone.  I feel blessed that God made a way for us to take this vacation, as we knew that it was going to be a bit pricey.  I feel like there is nothing in this world that you can buy your children that could even compare to spending those fun moments as a family.  We watched dolphins, sea turtles and sting rays and enjoyed ice cream and slushies on the pier twice.  Seeing those things through the eyes of children is seriously priceless.  A few days before we were to head home, we took family pictures on the beach and it was the best experience ever.  I have those memories to cherish.  My children were perfectly content collecting seashells and different sand dollars.  I hate seeing things such as this come to an end and having to head back to reality.

As summer began to end, she seemed a little nervous to leave me and her little sister. I realized that I there was no way to remove that feeling from her. Instead, I made plans for us to do activities when she finishes her school day. Planning ahead allows for her to feel like her school day really isn't too long. When school first began, she was very tired from the long day. I didn't realize how much her schedule had affected her, so I introduced \"cuddle time\", which is pretty fun for her. The most important aspects of my child starting school have been numerous. I learned how important my role as mom is for my kids. I am their literal compass, and that responsibility goes beyond just sending them off to school. I try to understand how her day is going, and what obstacles she faces each day.

The internet hadnt been invented yet and there werent as many bad temptations as there were when I was growing up. Now with he world wide web it seems as if there is way to much information at our fingertips and it has made the youth a whole lot lazier.

I talked to her about all of the things that were going through my head and she said that I was weirding her out.

She said that she wasnt sure cause she wanrwed to go to a school that the majority of her friends went to but she also wanted to not be distracted because of them as well. I on the other hand made the decision ro go to a school that none of my friends went to so that I could focus on studies and it wasnt a very god choice for me. I ended up having as really haed time because I didnt know any one and in turn it affected my studies in a negative way becaus I never wanted to go to class I wanted to go and hang ouy with my friends.

Who knows the next time this movie would be in a theater again. As I got to my seat, the theater was empty. Perfect. I was all set with my popcorn and soda and ready as ever. I forgot how long it had been since I had seen this movie. The film was enhanced and restored to have picture perfect quality fit for movies today. The thrill and mystery I remembered from this movie was bigger and better than ever on the big screen. Three other people were in the theater with me and I was able to watch the movie in total relaxation and peace. I am so glad I decided to see this movie today instead of my other choice.

The essence of the email was that something was coming soon, but don't worry, you still have a position here in the company. I recall being confused. At 12pm we had a company-wide conference call. We were told that in 30 days, we would no longer have an office as our contract had been canceled. This came as a complete shock to everyone, as just the week before we were on another conference call where we were assured that everything was peachy keen, the company was doing very well and we had nothing to worry about.  I remember feeling like someone punched me in the stomach, I was worried for myself and my 90 or so co-workers in the office that would not have a job in 30 days.

At the beginning of July my husband and I came to the decision to separate and divorce after a very lengthy discussion about where our relationship was going, or in this case was NOT going.  It was a very difficult decision for so many reasons.  I haven't been happy in so very long, a point I have made more than a few times within the last few years.  I tried desperately to express that I was unhappy to my husband and why I was unhappy in an attempt to fix our marriage, but it appeared my words fell on deaf ears.  I blamed myself for so long thinking that it was just me considering every time I tried to tell him why I was unhappy he never told me why he was unhappy, so I was led to believe I was the only one unhappy in the marriage.  It wasn't until our discussion that I found out that he was upset about something I was doing, or in that case was not doing, but the damage had long since been done.  I had given him more than a few opportunities to express his own feelings which he never took advantage of. This entire thing has been incredibly difficult on me to deal with considering we had just celebrated our 12th wedding anniversary, but I feel as though it is something I absolutely have to do in order for me to be happy.  I am absolutely exhausted, not to mention so very tired of being unhappy and being made to feel as though it were my fault, when it reality it was because he absolutely refused to communicate his own thoughts and feelings about what has been going on for more than a few years now. This entire thing has been in the making for quite some time, and it's only just recently that I finally felt that I had the strength and support of those close to me to do what I needed to do and end the marriage.  I have been torn for so long and debating about this decision for years now, but never had the courage to actually go through with it until recently. While it's sad that my marriage is failing, I am even more sad for the kids, of which we have two together.  They will have no idea what is going on, and the questions they have been asking me absolutely break my heart.  In the end we decided that the kids will continue to live with him which means that I will hardly get to see them.  It's incredibly stressful going through the motions of the divorce and to try and figure out custody of the children.

It was discussed at length and we did a lot of research. Our doctor went over it a bunch of times. We were thoroughly convinced that she would be born without any sort of these problems. Sure enough, by about age 1 or so, she showed signs of being, different. We were concerned so we took her in to a specialist. They did a battery of testing that took a few months. At first they figured it was just a simple case of her taking a bit longer than most kids learning simple things. But then the diagnosis came back with downs syndrome. We worked with a number of therapists and behavior experts for a few years. Slowly and surely, the outward signs were almost gone and we were very happy about this. Sure enough, now that she is in 1st grade, there's nothing that one can see to tell you that she has this disorder.

I had the light and was listening to my favorite music, I was so focused on what I was going to get at target that I guess I wasn't as aware of my surroundings. I was driving and crossing the intersection, as a car ran the red light from my left side and sent me into a spin.

I was lucky enough that the car tried to stop and swerved so much that I was hit with the side of the other car instead of the front of the other car. This was very striking as it was something that nobody expects, especially since I was just heading to the store. This left me in awe as my car came to a stop a little past the middle of the intersection. I was thankfully left unhurt and as soon as I was able to come to come to my senses I stepped out of my car. The other driver was also unhurt besides slight soreness and jitters. The driver made sure I was ok and called the cops to the scene, luckily there were witnesses at the scene to give a different perspective. I then called my spouses and parents to let them know what happened as I was the one who was running errands. The whole situation showed me that unexpected things could happen suddenly and change how you continue your day or change it overall. Luckily my car was not totaled and just needed some work on the rear side to assure that it was drive able. Overall, from this day I became very thankful for the things that I take for granted and make sure that I am always paying attention to my surroundings.

My parents and I briefly talked with everybody and were happy to catch up with them and learn how much everybody had accomplished. It was odd to see my cousins all grown up after I hadn't seen them for years. After a while my uncle made an announcement to welcome my parents and I back to Okinawa. After that, my other uncle and my cousin (his daughter) did a musical performance for us. They played the sanshin, which is a traditional Okinawan instrument similar to the Japanese shamisen.

My grandpa had also recently passed, and she talked about him, which made me start to cry.

I had to sell it because I lost my job and I had to save my family home from foreclosure until things get better again. I dreamed about this car since I was a boy of seven while looking at car magazines with my school buddies.  One day I came home from school and told my mom and dad that some day this car would be mine. They just laughed at my naive childhood dreams, they were simple country \"folk\", living in rural Texas. My was father a strict military man, stationed at a Fort Hood army base, and certainly not interested in fast cars or any \"fancy\" things like that. He would say that such things were a \"foolish waste of time and money\" and that a man's job is not to own \"fancy\" things but to serve his family and put bacon and bread on the table. However, I  was a free spirit, quiet different from my parents and their ways. I followed my dream of the \"super car\" and purchased my corvette when I turned twenty-two with my own hard-earned money. I loved my car all these years, not as a fancy object that I would show off to others, but a symbol of my own hard work and dreams. It represented my character and \"together\" we went through some many memorable experiences in life.  It was a very tough and heartbreaking decision to sell it, however, I had to do it for my wife and my two children. Their well-being and comfortable is much more important to me than any sentimental object-even my \"super car\". I told myself that when things turned around again, I could always get another one. Cars can be easily replaced but a family happiness in once in a lifetime.

I took several weeks to craft a personal statement to send to three law schools. I waited until the last possible day, of each law school's admission cycle, to submit my applications. One law school rejected me; it was the highest ranking school. Over the next two weeks, the other two law schools both accepted me and offered me 60% scholarships to attend their programs. Unfortunately, both schools offered these scholarships with conditions. The conditions seemed completely attainable- do not fall below the bottom 20% or the class, for one, and to stay above a 2.33 GPA for the other. Both of the schools that accepted me were relatively high-ranking schools. The dean of the higher ranking of the two schools requested a conference with me to discuss my options and any concerns I might have. Initially, that school had offered me a 40% scholarship but during this conversation the dean raised my scholarship offer from 40% to 60%, unsolicited. I attempted at that time to further negotiate my scholarship details- the conditions only. The dean expressed he would bring my concerns up with the admissions committee and contact me back with a determination. The admissions committee sent out my revised scholarship offer soon after, however the conditions were still attached. After long consideration, I withdrew my applications from both law schools. My goal was and continues to be to obtain 100% scholarship for law school. I will be retaking the LSAT and reapplying my earlier in the upcoming cycle.", "label": "recalled", "group": "LSDIVLY9"}

This past year (June 2019 ), we all got together for another Memorial. We all met at a restaurant in Philadelphia where I live. It was a Greek place and it was a lunch gathering. We all chatted, and it was great to see everyone. I had made each person a sun-catcher out of glass beads and colored wire because my sister loved the sun. I didn't expect some of the reactions. Some people cried. After the restaurant, we went to a church that a family member belonged to and had desserts and coffee. I also made a memory box where everyone could write a memory they had of my sister, and then it was given  to my niece. It was especially sad for me because I hadn't seen my sister in over 10 years, we were estranged. I had tried many times to get her to come to Philly, and I asked if I could come and see her. She refused every time. I'd give anything just to see her again. I do believe in God and heaven, so I have hope that I will see her some day.

It was a rather special moment because we had been playing the game together for several weeks and she had been chasing me pretty hard during that time. I'm kind of a celebrity in that game, and a bit of a ladies' man, so she really wanted to pin me down! I know this sounds ridiculous, but gamers are very strange and weird!

It almost felt like I was winning the lottery and \"too good to be true\", even though I would never admit to that since you have to play it cool and casual! I thought she was playing me for some sort of benefit in the video game, but the more we grew close to each other the more I realized how organic it was. Finally my paranoia began to shed and the event happened. \"I might be falling in love with you,\" she said. \"I'm thinking the same thing,\" I said. Later that night, when we said goodbye, it was a much more formal \"I love you\" exchange; I think we were both anticipating that moment, as it's a milestone of any relationship. I still remember all the matches we played that day, as well as the specifics of 99 percent of the Skype conversation (and subsequent voice chat).

I love nature and even seeing the same places when I come, they are always still just as beautiful. I had been going through a bit of a rough patch since I broke up with my gf of 3 years and this was exactly what I needed. Speaking of, the festival itself was fantastic.  I hooked up with a few people still left in town from HS that I grew up with and the first day we pregamed pretty good before we went.  They had plenty of live music and people from all over the state came with almost anything you could want.  My favorite parts were the garlic and cheese sections, the garlic people were set up in front on days 1 and 2 while the cheese folks were in the spotlight on days 4 and 5.  One of my friends actually got me to be on the panel for judging dishes there as well, which I couldn't thank them for enough.  It was so much fun and I got to get a bunch of recipes to bring back home with me!  Plus, I got to meet a chef from a few towns over who has their own show on the Food Network.  For someone who loves cooking as much as me, I felt like I was meeting an idol almost! Other than that, we spent a lot of time out in nature, bringing Sasha with us to our favorite lake to swim in from when we were kids.  My friends and I even spent a few days hiking even deeper into nature and pitching tents for a mini camping trip.  It was definitely one of my favorite visits out here!  I was able to completely get back in tune with myself and let nature and people boost me back up when I was down.", "label": "imagined", "group": "YTJCSHIK"}

It has been very difficult dealing with the images of finding him, trying to save him.  The memories of blame from his family and some of the people in his unit have destroyed me mentally and fueled the guilt and self-hatred that come along with my PTSD from this event to this very day. Even as a parent who loves her child, I found myself fighting the weight of crippling depression unsuccessfully.  As a result, I began seeking therapy and counseling so that my daughter can have the kind of mother every child deserves to have, bringing me to the present. I have been in counseling on and off for 7 years and have learned a lot, including that I was severely abused my entire life without understanding it and that I had grown up in a cult, which, unbeknownst to me, had already created a significant amount of trauma with which I lived. I struggle every day.  But my struggles are more manageable.  Over the past six months, I learned how to use grounding and mindfulness as a tool to bring myself out of a trauma reaction to the present moment.  And I found a great help for some of the symptoms of PTSD from a very surprising source-legal, medical marijuana. I have had a great deal of progress over the past 3 months, since I began using medical marijuana.  I am able to sleep.  I have been able to maintain a healthy weight, because I have an appetite again.  And it helps me to slow down, and be mindful regarding sensory stimuli while helping me to ground myself more quickly before I react. But most importantly, the absolute rages I experienced are not only decreased in frequency and magnitude, but eliminated altogether.  This was a major concern of mine, because I did not want my child growing up in a home living with my symptoms.  I never wanted my over reaction to stress to create anxiety in my child and I never wanted my child to have to cope with \"Mommy's symptoms\", because Mommy could or did not.  Going to parenting classes and reading parenting books has helped set a foundation for me as a parent.  I have used and exhausted every mental health resource available to me that I am aware of.

I had to find a clearing in the woods so that I could place it, and there was a nice spot about 300 feet in from the road. However, it was overshadowed by a 25 foot dead pine tree that was in the process of falling over. I pulled out my axe and helped it, knocking it down in about 10 minutes of work. I had to use my saw in certain parts due to the way the tree was angled. Once I finally got it down, I had plenty of firewood at my disposal, right next to my camp! I proceeded to de-limb the tree for kindling, and then sawed the larger main trunk of the tree for actual firewood. After clearing the area for about an hour, I now had a nice flat place to put my tent. I pitched my tent after sweeping the area with a few branches. When that was done, I decided to scour the area for large stones so that I could build a fire pit. I found about a dozen decent sized stones and carried them back to the campsite. I dug a small pit and arranged the stones around it, a wonderful start to my camping trip. From that point on, it was basically cooking, enjoying the scenery, and being along with my thoughts. I did some scouting around the area and found a very old graveyard, which I estimated to be at least 140 years old!

The first two days I took my family shopping in Chinatown and on the Las Vegas strip. We also went to eat at Fukuburger (our favorite spot) the next four days I spent helping my mom with her daily needs as well as cooking an cleaning. I felt I did my best and I was able to see for myself my moms healing journey. All in all I am glad I went. I felt good about the trip and it showed my kids how much I care for my mom and that I tried my best while I was there.

Usually seeing long lost relatives is a joyous occasion for most families. We aren't most families. Usually, we don't all get along. Today wasn't usual. Today we gathered to pay our respect to one of the most complicated men most of us have ever known. Today, we all supported each other and consoled one another in the name of my Dad. My dad passed away a week ago and today was his memorial. This has been a difficult week. Trying to grasp the fact that he is gone has been tough, but today was the worst. We had an open casket. He looked so strange, it was him and yet not him I watched as some of my family broke down into tears, some quietly. Others held it in. I felt I had to be strong for my own little family. My children will never again get to see their grandpa. I will never again get to see my dad, yet as a dad, I couldn't let me kids watch me break down completely.

Not only was my husband having to use an electric wheelchair, but Orlando was under a heat advisory. It was the hottest day of the year and Disney's busiest day of the year! What really impressed me was how much fun we had an how little waiting we had to do despite the adverse conditions. We got to Disney World as soon as it opened, determined to make the best of our time there. We at breakfast in our AirBnb and headed out. Because of my husband's injury, we got to park in handicapped parking. This was definitely a silver lining of his having to use a wheelchair! We were in covered parking and didn't have to walk far at all. We got into the park and started with our pre-scheduled fast passes. Everything went so smoothly and the waits were so short. The highlight of our trip was my daughter getting to meet all the princesses. I was worried about this, and figured we wouldn't be meeting any characters. Everything I had heard was that you had to wait in line for hours and it didn't seem worth it to me. But you can use a fast pass for character meetings! So we did that, and it was amazing. My daughter loves meeting characters. We got to take great pictures of our own and she had a blast. Another big surprise for me was how amazing the food was. We had nachos for lunch and hamburgers for dinner, and they were so delicious! I've eaten a lot of theme park food at various Six Flags and even at Universal the day before. Wow! Disney really delivered on the menu items. It was Independence Day, so our day ended with fireworks. It wasn't always easy navigating with the wheelchair and putting up with the heat, but it was definitely worth it.", "label": "retold", "group": "75XUIV6V"}

It's almost frustrating because it was so close to a perfect trip. The place was just beautiful. We've been to DisneyLand a handful of times and one of the things that always impressed me was how clean it was. Disney World definitely held that same quality of being almost unnaturally clean for a place that's mostly exterior and that the public has full access to. The rides were super fun though the wait was predictably long. And it's almost more about the atmosphere anyways than the rides. What's great is going to a spot and having a full scale experience of being in that place and part of that fictional universe. About getting as close to feeling like it's real as you possibly can. The Disney parks are so amazing for that. And it was such a neat thing to experience with my family. I'm glad we all got a chance to go and share it even with the new additions. I remember going to DisneyLand with my parents and two siblings when we were young and it was like, another level of awesome to go with my parents, my husband, my brother and his wife, and my sister, her husband and her daughter. Watching the family grow and then all still be able to come together and do something fun as a group is another level of special. I always appreciate when we get to do these big vacations. BUT THEN there was that one thing, just that one thing that made the trip less than perfect. I got food poisoning on the second night!  It just ended up being such a wretched evening and I was up all night trying to get it out of my system which meant I was exhausted the next day.

The funeral was large because she had quite a few children and all of them attended. My grandmother had a lot of friends too so it was nice seeing all of them paying their respect. I did not talk much during the funeral. All I could do was think about all the good memories we had together. It was nostalgic. Seeing her body in the casket felt unreal. I could not believe that I could no longer spend time with her anymore. It made me regret not seeing her much when I was an adult.

Mythological stories, as well as the ideas of classic history, became increasingly reverted back to with the start of Neoclassicism. Rationality and tradition were rediscovered and implemented into artwork more frequently in the mid-eighteenth century; these key thoughts made up the ideals of Neoclassicism; the classical revival in European art. One of the great artists of the time was Baron Francois Gerard, whose oil painting of Cupid and Psyche in 1798 represented a true masterpiece of the Neoclassical period due to its overall focus on the main characters in the narrative while integrating powerful symbolism and creating a high quality of realism. Baron Francois Gerard\u2019s 1798 painting of Cupid and Psyche portrays Psyche sitting on a grassy hill-like area. She is shown with a very vacant and far-off gaze as if observing something in the distance. Her posture is relaxed yet her arms are almost in a folded position over her bare body. Cupid is right next to her and has his arms wrapped around her carefully as to not touch her. His gaze is right at her face and has a look of longing in his eyes.

I had tried my hand at being a writer, something I always wanted to do, but the sales of my first book were stagnant. I sat at home, wondering how I was going to pay all of my bills, and stared at my useless degree in economics. I never had a passion for economics, and always wanted to do something related to writing. As I contemplated my options, which pretty much amounted to flipping burgers at this point, I got a call from my friend Amy. She mentioned that she had the perfect opportunity for me. Her seventh grade class was doing a lesson on writing, and she wanted me to teach them. I immediately started to freak out. I had no formal training in writing. I mean, it was a passion of mine, but I was mostly self taught. How was I supposed to get a bunch of unruly seventh graders to listen to me? I decided that I wasn't really in a position to act superior to them. I decided to think humble thoughts, and place myself on their level. If I could think of what would interest a seventh grader, I could get through to them. The day of the lesson, I was so nervous. I started to doubt myself. There was no way I would be able to get through to these kids and I was going to fail. Amy talked to me a few minutes before we started, and told me that the students like a certain television show set in the 1980s where the characters have adventures. A light bulb went off in my head. All I had to do was relate the lesson plan to the television show that I also liked, and was very familiar with. The lesson was a great success. Amy even invited me to continue helping her and she thinks I will eventually get a full time job there. I was so delighted, and couldn't believe it.", "label": "imagined", "group": "MUZXK30M"}

Our condo was beach front and we had an umbrella and chairs set up for us every morning so that made things very easy with 3 boys! It was also very nice to already have a spot saved for us. We spent every day down at the beach. My kids had a blast in the water and on the sand, riding the waves in the water and building sand castles in the sand. Not once was I stressed and not once did the boys complain that they were bored! The older two boys played great together and the baby was happy just being there, played in the sand, played in the water, waved to people that were nearby. He loved the beach and whenever he was tired he would crawl up on my lap or my husbands lap and take an hour plus nap. We also played miniature golf one day, got ice cream a couple of the days and went to dinner a couple of the nights. The weather was very hot but it wasn't unbearable.

The day of the wedding, I put on the dress and had my makeup done. I looked a lot like a drag queen, but if my friend wants a drag queen at her wedding, then that's what she'll get! The ceremony itself was very beautiful. People were a bit confused about why I was wearing a dress, but they adjusted after a bit and everything went smoothly. I now have a bridesmaid dress hanging in my closet. Not sure what I'll ever use that for again, though I might not need to get a Halloween costume this year. The experience of wearing the dress was not as bad as I thought. It was relatively comfortable. However, it was the high heels and bra that were the worst.

I had an entire piece of cheesecake on top of mine while she had an entire lollypop with cotton candy and many other small delicious treats.

Well, the guy in the car said \"Hey, are you (my name, first and last) by any chance?\" Skeptical, I said \"Yes, I am. Do I know you?\" The voice sounded familiar, though distantly and I couldn't place it. He told me his name and that we went to high school together.

This was one of the handful of people who was nice to me in high school! Oh my God! This was a rare someone I actually hung out with in high school! Given I was bullied without mercy and was a hardcore recluse (still am something of a recluse to this day), that was a big feat! My mouth dropped open and I said \"1-800-555-ElCheapo!!!\" El Cheapo was this sarcastic series of letters we wrote from dark or incompetent characters such as King Koopa or Bozo the Clown that came up with ideas and rules for the school that we didn't like or felt were unfair to the teachers/school board encouraging them to enact these rules. It was sort of a parody and lampoon of the school as a whole. Great way to vent and relieve stress given we were both sort of on the social fringe of the school. He said \"Yeah man, that's it!\", recalling it! After graduation we had lost touch and this was the first I'd seen of him in 20 years. We chatted for quite a while in the rain, catching up on life.

You never know who these people may be (possibly your roommate, neighbor, coworker, long lost friend, lover, or even a complete stranger) but when you lock eyes with them, you know at that very moment that they will affect your life in some profound way. And sometimes things happen to you that may seem horrible, painful, and unfair at first, but in reflection you find that without overcoming those obstacles you would have never realized your potential, strength, willpower, or heart. Everything happens for a reason. Nothing happens by chance or by means of luck. Illness, injury, love, lost moments of true greatness, and sheer stupidity all occur to test the limits of your soul. Without these small tests, whatever they may be, life would be like a smoothly paved, straight, flat road to nowhere. It would be safe and comfortable, but dull and utterly pointless. The people you meet who affect your life, and the success and downfalls you experience help to create who you become. Even the bad experiences can be learned from. In fact, they are probably the most poignant and important ones. If someone hurts you, betrays you, or breaks your heart, forgive them, for they have helped you learn about trust and the importance of being cautious when you open your heart. If someone loves you, love them back unconditionally, not only because they love you, but because in a way, they are teaching you to love and how to open your heart and eyes to things.", "label": "recalled", "group": "DB9CBDR0"}

It is still one of the most unforgettable events of my life. I was a part of it along with my spouse since the beginning, from the doctor visits up until she and the baby were discharged from the hospital. It was a long road but all worth it. As a part of the story there was one event that stood out. In the middle of the surgery when the baby was delivered, that tense and overwhelming moment, the doctor looked at me and asked where the camera is so I can take her first picture. I was so lost and in a hurry to get in the surgery room that I have completely forgot to bring the camera with me. I was so happy, a feeling that I have never experienced before, it felt like I was a new person, a new me. I remember calling my family, my parents and brothers letting them know that my daughter was born. I was very excited and proud when I gave them the news. Another exciting moment was when we all got finally home. From that moment I knew that all our focus has shifted on her. Everything is about her now, cuddling, feeding, bathing and even doctor visits for shots. We both learned to cherish every moment we're spending with her. The feelings of joy I had back then are unchanged and we are enjoying her as much and will for many years to come.", "label": "retold", "group": "IU21XHXL"}

Quite possible she may have had a cold or maybe she was struggling with allergies. It turned out that it was much more. Lilly suffered from a tumor on her heart and mucous that surrounded her lungs. We knew the results were unfavorable, but we didn't quite understand the severity. It was almost impossible to wrap our heads around. This seemingly healthy, happy, and beautiful dog was ill and right before our eyes we couldn't even grasp it. Within a week it was determined that to allow her the tiniest amount of suffering possible we would have to put her to sleep. It crushed us. It crushed me.

I met with my midwife and she sat down with my daughter in the waiting room as I went in for my surgery. My doula met me in the post-op room, and we spent awhile there talking with the surgeon about what I could expect. As they brought me into the room, I remember the brightness and 'holiness', if you will, of the operation room. I sat down on the cold table and the anesthesiologist came to prep me for my spinal. That was the moment I lost it and began to cry. Not because it hurt, but because I was about to meet my son. It felt surreal. I was given the spinal and immediately laid back on the table so the medicines could kick in. They draped a curtain over my stomach and I began practicing my breathing techniques I had learned for the home birth I had originally planned to have. My son was breech up until 41 weeks, and although I did everything I could to get him to turn, he remained the 'wrong' way and I ended up scheduling my c-section. I felt so calm. The complete opposite of how I had expected to feel as I lay there, about to be cut open. The smell of burning flesh hit me. I felt a bit of tugging as I deeply breathed in and slowly out. I looked at my doula and asked her if they had started it yet. She smiled at me and said \"He's almost here.\" A minute later I heard a loud cry, and I broke out of my trance and began to cry myself. He was here. They came around the curtain with him and my first thought was how beautiful he was with his little wrinkly forehead. I couldn't wait to hold him.

My husband and I were needing a home and looking for a rental property, and this was a charming old house that was built in the late 1800's. Our landlord disclosed to my husband (not to me), that a previous tenant had committed suicide shortly before we were to move in. Knowing that we were already locked in and ready to move, my husband decided not to tell me about the situation for fear I would back out of the deal. It wasn't until we moved in and were settled that he shared the secret with me. The room that the tenant had killed herself in was my new office, and I had always had trouble breathing in there. There is no way to describe it other than the air was constantly sucked out of the room, so that if you were in there for any length of time with the windows and door closed, you literally could not breathe and would feel very faint, as though you needed oxygen or were going to black out. The first month we lived there, we would leave the light over the sink in the kitchen on. It would cut out at several second intervals throughout the night, which I could always see from my position in the bedroom while trying to go to sleep. It would render the house completely dark, and was unnerving. We decided to move out after two months because of the...unrest...that was felt there. Everyone who came into the house could feel the heaviness and the difficulty breathing. IT turned out that the previous tenant had overdosed, purposely, on Klonopin and suffocated in her sleep.

I managed to set up the cake and prepare it for the bride in 20 minutes and head towards my father in law. I had to leave the church before the bride was even able to come see the cake. I then drove 4 hours with two little kids to meet my husband. Thankful my father in law is on the mend but that was an extremely stressful day. The bride ended up being very happy with the cake as well and the wedding has gotten me several other orders.", "label": "recalled", "group": "AXM2BN12"}

After so many years of hard work, sleepless nights, working over the weekends, working more than 40 hours per week, after my college degree and certifications that I took in school I got promoted at work! My Manager ask me if we can have a quick meeting today to discuss some personal projects about my development here at work, and at the beginning of the meeting everything went smoothly, we were talking about new projects that were coming up and how I was doing in my current role. Then he tells me, what do you think if I offer you a supervisory position of the department? I was in shock and my answer was of course yes, this is the opportunity that I was looking for since I start in this company, all the hard work finally pay off. Then he makes me sign a paper with my salary increase and the new title. At that moment I was shaking and feeling anxious because this is an important moment of my life, and that I know that I have the potential to do more here in the company. After I signed those papers I tell thank you to my boss for this amazing opportunity of advancement in my career and I will never let him down in my new position. He said congratulations you deserve it, and I want to see more awesome things here at work. Then I left his office and I immediately called my wife and tell her the notice of my promotion and she was so happy because it is a new chapter for our life, with our new baby and kid, more money for the family and a bright future here in the company. It is a very emotional moment for me and my family, that I will never forget. After that I called my dad and mom to tell them the notice of my promotion here at work, my mom was all happy and she was telling how smart I'm and to be thankful with God for every step that I do at my career here at work. In the other hand my dad was kind of surprised, but he told me to shot for the top, keep fighting for your dreams and keep fighting for your family, because at the end they are all depending in your salary/money for a place to live, pay rent, groceries, entertainment. But at the end I know that he was happy but he wants me to see like in a Director/Managerial position, he always tells me that I have a lot of potential and that I'm very smart in whatever I do. Then after talking with my dad and mom, I give the surprise to my mom and father in law, they were so happy and pride that I got that promotion, because they know how much did I suffer to get that promotion and they gave me their best wishes and blessing to my family and always to look forward of new opportunities wherever I go.", "label": "recalled", "group": "RA7SBCFF"}

It's always been stressful yet rewarding for me over the thousands of hours I have played in this game but my last week's game stands out than the rest. I picked Crystal Maiden as my hero and I went with another person who played a carry Slark at the bottom lane. My lane partner was very vocal on the team chat on how I am very inefficient and was stealing his experience points in the game. He did say something about how \"noob\" I am and grew more and more frustrated minute by minute. He was killed multiple times in the early game and of course, I was blamed for it. I did not let his words be a distraction nor a way to just give up and surrender. Even though I had a mic, I stayed quiet and just typed \"I'm sorry\" on chat whenever he screamed at me. Our towers are down but I kept optimistic on winning. Even though he was being angry at me and whenever I made I mistake I get bullied by him, he also never gave up and continued gaining experience and gold necessary for his hero to be powerful. The first time the enemy made a mistake and we won a team fight, I immediately congratulated our team for the great play and my other teammates were all audibly optimistic as well. Our carry Slark at this point has considerably limited his verbal abuse and I was sure that he will cooperate once he realized we were all there to win the game. The enemy had many more mistakes after that and we had a very satisfying comeback. I would always commend and rate positively my teammates whenever I win, so I did it as well with Slark. I was surprised that he did commend me back and got a friend request from him after the game. I did accept his friend requests and we've been playing a few more games to this day. I actually quite like his company and we enjoy our in-game banter and he actually jokes a lot with me now.", "label": "imagined", "group": "XOJ9N073"}

It was especially great for me because I decided secretly to buy the dress for her. After looking at the 2 dresses, it was easy to see that one suited her much better than the other. She gathered up all the layers and went into the dressing room. When she came out she was beaming. She's petite, so it dragged on the floor, but otherwise, it was perfect. The bodice was modest, yet feminine. The dress was not too formal, not too casual, which was something we had worried about finding. The shop assistant helped to arrange the drape of the dress and to hold up the back to demonstrate what the bustle would look like on her. We all loved it. She also showed how the alterations would eliminate some wrinkling at the bodice that looked a little odd. We also looked at a few veils but my daughter decided she didn't want a veil. She saw some hair combs she thought she might like instead, but we didn't make a decision about that. They were rather expensive for just a fancy comb and we were concerned abut how well they would stay in her hair. We took pictures and they had my daughter ring a bell, which was some kind of bridal tradition I didn't know about, but was cute. She then met with the alterations person briefly and made an appointment for the measuring. While her friend distracted her, I went to the counter and paid for the dress. My daughter was surprised and happy to find the dress paid for. We all left happy and relieved that the big decision had been made and the dress was so perfect for her.

The presentation seemed to go fairly well and I am not too worried about my grade as I do not need a high one to maintain my A.  Afterwards, I went to the health science building and began studying for my anatomy practical/exam.  My grade this was VERY important.  I had to make at least an 88 to maintain my A in the class.  I had began studying HARD two weeks prior and had spent nearly 20 hours over the weekend digging through cadavers trying to make sense of it all.  Now, I only had 5 more hours to prepare, so I made the most of my time by focusing hard on the fringe topics that I currently knew the least about.  As studied, time accelerated until I got to the point where I needed to go change into my scrubs.  I showed up outside of the lab, behind a line of about twelve of the fifteen other students.  This meant that I would likely not go into the practical until the second round (we only had about nine stations and fifteen won't fit).  This was a bittersweet realization, as I both wanted to get it done and also wanted to study a bit more.  This indeed came to pass, as I waited another 30 minutes after arriving before the practical began.  During this, I spoke with one of classmates quite a bit about her dog, as I shuffled back and forth over my notes. Once the practical began, things seemed to go very well until about the eighth question.  Suddenly, the professors had rearranged a cadaver's cranium and disarticulated the mandible to provide a different vantage point of many structures than we had seen during the dissection itself.  I did my best and moved on, but not before several more hiccups were thrown my way.  After the practical, we moved on to the written exam portion.  This was the hardest one to date and I had to attempt to make sense of bits of information I had in my head as the seam together into a coherent biological system.  Nothing felt as good as I wanted it to.  I was afraid that I was going to lose my A.  After wrapping up my exam, I slowly walked up to turn it in, got my things, and left.  As I walked out to my car, I decided to check my phone and the grade for my practical had already been posted.  I got a 98!

We were not as close as some, but I had a great deal and respect for him. He was also the last of his generation. Obviously, I experienced personal loss and grief, and sorrow and sympathy for his three daughters (my only first cousins on that side of the family) and their children and grand children, but it goes beyond that. It indirectly signifies that my brothers and I are getting older. My brothers are in their 50s and I am 43. My Uncle's death makes me aware of our own aging, as now we are the oldest generation in our part of the family. Sometimes I still feel like a young man, but I am impelled by my Uncle's death to realize that not only am I firmly ensconced in middle age, but will be a senior before I know it. The swift march of the passage of time boggles me -- like they say the days crawl but the years fly.  Additionally, it makes me aware of the larger \"circle of life\", if you'll pardon the phrase -- we're just another generation moving a slot in an unbroken chain. Others will come after. Eventually, I will be in my 70s, 80s, and then it will be my time to pass. So not only am I filled with sorrow and sympathy, but I am very aware of the passage of time.  My own aging and immortality are very apparent.", "label": "recalled", "group": "2J0BN9E4"}

I was trying to start up the car but it would not. Then I tried to open my car doors but it would not open. The train ended up hitting a back of my car, sending me flying down the road, thankfully there were no other cars. At that moment the time literally stopped for me. I have seen life flashing through my eyes. Then it went black and I found myself later in a white room with bright lights. Thankfully I was not hurt that bad.

I spent 5 hours getting more and more anxious. Everything about the building, the people and what the trainer was discussing felt like it was grating on my nerves. I have had panic/anxiety attacks before and felt that one was coming. I walked out to my car, got in and started wheezing and crying and feeling trapped.

I have always wanted to be the head of some type of group with people and recently I had the chance. With the release of The Galaxy Note 10 came a large opportunity to create a reddit group to encompass the new device. This is a yearly thing wherein people create a subreddit(community) dedicated to the newest Samsung device every year. I browsed reddit but found that someone had already created a galaxynote10 subreddit. I was honestly pretty gassed about the situation so I decided to take a deeper look. Upon further inspection I found that it was private/locked and with that came an idea. I decided at that very moment to create a new subreddit dedicated to the device to attract the people who would have gone to the original had it not been locked. I named it r/TheGalaxyNote10 and immediately got to work making it look official. My main goal was to make it look so official that even if the original subreddit opened up, people would still come to mine due to how \"Official\" it felt overall. After claiming the subreddit name I immediately went to work customizing the palette of the community and creating a custom banner in the style of Samsung's official font. I honestly had not felt so motivated and excited for a long time and the thrill of working against the clock was exhilarating. After setting up the theme and having it look official and beautiful I knew I had to spread the word about it so I posted to the r/Android community as well as the Samsung communities. After posting to numerous subreddits to get people to know that my subreddit was not private and available for all, I had quite a few negative comments. People were putting it down saying it's not the official subreddit and they down-voted it numerous times. I don't know if you've ever had someone just be incredibly negative towards something close to your heart that you worked hard for but it felt absolutely horrible. It hurt quite a bit so I honestly just logged off and said whatever, \"I did my best.\" What do you know, the next morning I wake to have over 100 members! Holy moses it was incredible, I thought this was going to be a failure but I succeeded. After a while I was given the original r/galaxynote10 subreddit since it had been private for so long so I migrated everything over to the new one. I now own the original subreddit and have amassed nearly 6000 members in 3 weeks! It honestly was incredible to actually win one which is why I shared this.

I would theorize it could have been mostly due to competition for the affection of our parents. I was the second child...she was the first. She was the one with stellar grades all throughout her education, from kindergarten all the way through her prestigious university years. She is now a professional musician in an orchestra as well as a music teacher. Growing up I tended to be a rather mediocre student.

Perhaps because I knew devoting a great deal of energy to \"competing\" with my sister would not only be futile, but absolutely exhausting. I have always been one to get lost in my thoughts and I prefer to be in nature to feel truly alive. That is why it was so memorable that a few months ago my mother told me that recently my sister told her that she only knows particular symphonies because she would hear me playing them in my room, next door to hers. I did not even know she was listening to the music I was playing, I always pictured her diligently reading and/or practicing the various instruments with which she is now proficient. After hearing that from my mother I actually felt a rush of pride. Not only was I absorbing and getting lost in the extraordinary music, but I was also influencing my orchestral musician sister. To add to that, the other day, she called me up about a certain composer because, as she put it, I am a \"musicologist of sorts.\" (In  addition to listening to music, I would study biographical information about the various composers to whom I listened. Back in my childhood days, I never would have dreamed that I would be having an unintended influence on my rather brilliant sister.
