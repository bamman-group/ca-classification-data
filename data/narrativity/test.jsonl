Valerie has a somewhat implausible yet incontrovertible four-pronged connection to the attacks unfolding 1,000 miles to the south of her in Manhattan.

That was evidently its purpose when first enacted, for then it was part of a section which, while providing for suits in the courts of the United States or of the State, as the plaintiff might elect, declared in express terms that if the suit was begun in a state court no attachment should issue until after judgment. The form of its re\u00ebnactment in the Revised Statutes does not change its meaning in this particular. It stands now, as it did originally, as the paramount law of the land that attachments shall not issue from state courts against national banks, and writes into all state attachment laws an exception in favor of national banks. Since the act of 1873 all the attachment laws of the State must be read as if they contained a provision in express terms that they were not to apply to suits against a national bank.", "group": "SCOTUS", "id": 9222}

The narrative is substantially enlivened by the stories of individuals who rely on the oil sands to buy groceries and pay their mortgages. These include a Pakistani immigrant and weekend cricketer who drives a bus that ferries workers to various mining sites; a fisherman who divides his time between his lobster boat and working as a crane operator; and a young Indigenous man who works with heavy equipment when he isn\u2019t monitoring his fur trapline.,Turner deftly weaves together the personal and the political, the local and the global. In the process, he gives general readers a top-to-bottom, broadly contextual perspective on the past, present, and potential future of an important, if problematic, Canadian resource that produces as many as 2.4 million barrels of oil per day. The latter portions of the book focus on the precarious economic viability of the oil patch, not only because of the way it has become tangled up in the debates over pipelines and climate change, but because of a fracking boom south of the border that has made the U.S. less dependent on Alberta oil.", "group": "BREVIEW", "id": 9223}

Rachel\u2019s vague outcast status and alienation from her more \u201cnormal\u201d peers make her a character who is easy to empathize with.,A chance introduction to metal, overheard from a car stereo, gives Rachel a new outlet by which to communicate her silent angst, vindicating and assuaging her feelings of otherness.

The girls start a band of their own, hilariously named Colostomy Hag.,In spare, quick-moving prose, Taylor unfolds a story that does not delve too deeply into the relationships between its characters (Rachel\u2019s sister is barely mentioned and her parents are underdeveloped), and a large portion of the book seems like a laundry list lending necessary backstory and documentation leading up to the plot\u2019s climax.

These efforts by Clemenceau (a man known for his powers of persuasion) sparked what would become an obsession on the part of the Impressionist master spanning more than a decade.,Canadian art historian and two-time Governor General\u2019s Literary Award winner Ross King turns his finely honed gaze to the project that would \u2013 despite frequent bouts of self-doubt, destructive flares of temper, near blindness, and the disruptions of the First World War \u2013 become Monet\u2019s greatest accomplishment: his Grande D\u00e9coration, a series of huge canvases depicting his beloved water lilies.,King gives a cursory overview of Monet\u2019s life prior to the period between 1914 and the artist\u2019s death in 1926, noting that, despite his stereotypical \u201cartistic temperament,\u201d Monet was incredibly successful, earning a substantial amount of money from his work, which allowed him to purchase property in Giverny, where he cultivated the famous garden from which he drew so much inspiration. We\u2019re also provided with much historical context and just enough art history to render Monet\u2019s story accessible to those with little familiarity with the master beyond recognizing some of his better-known paintings.,More importantly, King provides a sense of the man himself, using quotations from Monet\u2019s letters and the historical record to create a portrait of a beloved man who nevertheless often acted like a needy, petulant child, begging favours from Clemenceau and other well-connected friends, especially during the war. Despite this (as King tells it), Monet\u2019s talent and largesse made up for the times he was in a foul mood, and there is no denying the painter\u2019s artistic genius or passion.,While the book is, for the most part, true to its promise to elucidate readers about Monet during the painting of the water lilies, King does lose focus from time to time.

The latter device having been already embodied in patent No. 217,838, these features Mr. Westinghouse introduced into the patent in suit, by which a passage was opened directly from the train-pipe filled from the main reservoir on the engine, to the brake-cylinder through which, in cases of emergency, the train-pipe air, instead of being discharged *551 into the atmosphere, could pour directly from the train-pipe into the brake-cylinder.

Even Pangur sits silently, studying a hole in the baseboard, waiting with patient intensity for the mouse to emerge.,The book relies heavily on the imagery of illustrator Sydney Smith, whose recent success with, Sidewalk Flowers, (with JonArno Lawson) attests to his ability to craft a wordless narrative. Indeed, the first five pages of ,The White Cat and the Monk, simply show Pangur finding his way into the monastery and the monk\u2019s quarters, quietly leading young readers into this introspective tale.

This information will likely elicit some squirming and \u201ceww-ing\u201d from young readers, but Eamer makes it clear that not all germs are harmful, and most are in fact beneficial.,Walking kids through the various types of microbes (which Eamer calls \u201chitchhikers\u201d), the author strikes the right balance between fact and fun. In describing single-celled organisms called Archaea, for example, Eamer notes that the bacteria are \u201cexperts at surviving in tough places \u2013 one kind can even live in acid strong enough to eat through metal. Others, though, hang out in comfier places, such as your belly button.\u201d,Eamer then moves on to more complicated ground, covering topics that include how microbiomes are created, what causes them to change, why there are different types of microbes, where those different types can be found, and why some of them are good for you and some bad for you.

This dissection of the eulogy as a genre is itself something of a eulogy, albeit one published a dozen years after the death of its subject.,Cooper positions the eulogy somewhere between the fact-focused obituary and the more lyrical elegy. Her chief complaints regarding the state of this \u201camateur\u2019s art\u201d concern the velocity at which eulogizers are expected to do their work and the reliance on clich\u00e9 that inevitably emerges from such rush jobs.,Beloved famous people provide useful case studies: the 1997 death of Diana, Princess of Wales, prompted a whitewash of a eulogy from her brother and an astonishingly indolent rewrite of an extant memoriam ballad from Elton John; the deaths of music icons David Bowie and Prince within mere months of each other in 2016 formed a grim double whammy that unleashed tidal bores of sometimes queasily competitive eulogizing on social media. Cooper\u2019s evaluation of our increasingly public displays of mourning graciously prizes curiosity over facile cynicism, and her seemingly voracious appetite for art, analysis, and anecdote allows for a pleasingly broad sampling of culture: Roland Barthes gets as much ink as Princess Di, and, at one point, Cher, Derrida, and ,The Big Lebowski, mingle within the same paragraph.,As a polemic, however, ,The Last Word, has its limits.", "group": "BREVIEW", "id": 10908}

This partition has an aperture, B, the capacity of which is less than that of the large passage A, and intermediate in size between that of the graduating passage 40, and that of the port covered by the valve 22. The office of this partition is thus explained by the defendants in their briefs: When the engineer's valve is thrown wide open, the poppet-valve is lifted from its seat by the extreme traverse of the piston, and a new action takes place. \"\"The port of the main valve 22 is so much larger than the passage B, that the pressure in the main valve-chamber C is instantly emptied into the brake-cylinder, and, as the passage B cannot supply air so fast as the main-valve port can exhaust it, the pressure in the main valve-chamber suddenly drops to about five pounds. Meanwhile the passage A, leading from the auxiliary reservoir to the inner end of the piston-chamber, is so much larger than the passage B, leading from the piston-chamber to the main valve-chamber, that full reservoir pressure is maintained in the piston-chamber between the partition 9 and the inner side of the piston, thereby holding the piston back firmly at its extreme traverse. But the feed-valve 26 is now exposed on the one side to a train-pipe pressure of about fifty-five pounds, and on the other side to a main valve-chamber pressure of only about five pounds, and therefore valve 26 is instantly forced open by the greater train-pipe pressure, which then vents freely through the said feed valve-port into the main valve-chamber C where it commingles with the auxiliary reservoir air passing through said chamber, and both airs pass together through the port opened by the main valve 22 *571 to the brake-cylinder.", "group": "SCOTUS", "id": 10936}

As the fighting came to an end, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) was formed in the Hague to prosecute those who maintained command responsibility for some of the most egregious crimes.,In 2008, Behar travelled from Toronto to join the legal team, and recounts in vivid, disturbing detail a series of crimes and cover-ups, as well as courageous testimony from survivors who often risked their lives to tell their stories. Behar offers a series of depressingly similar accounts of slaughter and the infrastructure of disappearance: victims are first buried, later dug up, transported elsewhere, then reburied or incinerated \u2013 all to hide clear evidence of wrongdoing.,While Behar\u2019s presentation of geopolitics is limited \u2013 his overview of the conflict\u2019s roots could have benefitted from more discussion of the roles NATO and international financial organizations played in the Yugoslav breakup \u2013 he nonetheless raises,\nimportant questions about what difference this complex, labyrinthine legal process will ultimately make.

But like the best series writers \u2013 Ian Rankin and Peter Robinson come to mind \u2013 Hamilton manages to avoid that pitfall and keep the Ava Lee books fresh. He accomplishes this by acknowledging the elements that initially attracted Lee\u2019s voracious fans, while simultaneously shifting the overarching narrative to force the character \u2013 and the reader \u2013 into fresh terrain.,The Princeling of Nanjing, begins with a fashion show. It\u2019s less than a year after the death of Uncle \u2013 Lee\u2019s partner and mentor, an enigmatic former Triad leader \u2013 and five months after the events of Hamilton\u2019s last book, ,The King of Shanghai,, which saw Lee embarking on a business partnership of her own, the Three Sisters investment firm, and being drawn into the dangerous world of Triad succession.,The fashion show is the first fruit of Three Sisters, an over-the-top fete to launch the Po line of designer clothes.", "group": "BREVIEW", "id": 11021}

Defendant's theory is that they are limited to such passageway when governed by the auxiliary valve 41, a device which, although of no utility as arranged in the patent in suit, became afterwards exceedingly useful when further combined with the supplementary piston shown in patent No. 376,837.

{"label": "NEG", "text": "It is claimed, however, by the complainants that Boyden was not the inventor of the differential pressure theory; that there is such a differential pressure in their own patent, caused by the fact that the air from the auxiliary reservoir in passing to the brake-cylinder travels through a restricted port, 35, and, as the entrance to the brake-cylinder is through a much larger port, the air is taken up by it much more rapidly than it is *572 supplied by the restricted port, which reduces the pressure in the by-passage so much that when the quick-action valve 41 is opened, the pressure from the train-pipe air is sufficient to open the valve 49 and admit a full volume of train-pipe air, at a pressure of fifty-five pounds, to the brake-cylinder. The fact, however, that no suggestion is made in the patent of such a function of the restricted port 35, indicates either that none such had been discovered, or that it was not considered of sufficient importance to mention it. Indeed, it seems to have been an afterthought, suggested by the necessity of an answer to defendants' argument, based upon their partition 9. That when the auxiliary valve is opened there must be a difference in pressure above and below the check-valve 49, in order to open it, is manifest; yet, this is rather an incident to the Westinghouse device than the controlling feature that it is made in the Boyden patent. There is no partition in the proper sense of the word \u0097 certainly none located as in the Boyden device \u0097 between the chambers D and C, and no aperture in such partition opened for the express purpose of maintaining this differential pressure.", "group": "SCOTUS", "id": 11577}

Things fall into place too neatly, are over-simplified or explained away in a matter of lines (a gun-wielding patient is subdued by a lawyer and fellow group member who happens to have a black belt; the return of Amelia\u2019s father after more than a decade\u2019s absence, glossed over in half a page, feels unrealistically amicable and devoid of feeling). Characters and their interactions have potential, but often feel like one-dimensional tropes.,We are given glimpses of how strong de Nikolits\u2019s writing can be in a few beautifully descriptive paragraphs full of stunning narration sans dialogue, but these instances are too rare, and we are left with a palpable lack of description elsewhere in the book.

Henstra mixes everything from political manoeuvring to drug smuggling to journalistic integrity to class disparity and more into her complex tale. Leo is a woman of her time: despite the fact she stands to inherit her aunt\u2019s great fortune, it is only through marriage to the right man that she will, ironically, find some measure of independence. Still, her uniqueness emboldens her, and when she suspects her brother-in-law and Thornfax are somehow mixed up with the bombings that have been occurring around the city in protest of the proposed bill banning the importation of opium, she sets out to find the facts.

It is instead an ambitious attempt to unite a variety of peoples, experiences, classes, and religions under one umbrella: skin colour. Mixing reportage from 10 countries and four continents, historical analysis, media accounts, and his own personal insights, Al-Solaylee has crafted a thoughtful look at a certain kind of marginalized experience, seen through the lens of his own history of migration.,Born into a Yemeni family, Al-Solaylee felt he had no choice but to identify himself by his skin colour, just as others see him as Arab and Muslim.

If Texas is right, appellant cannot obtain a refund of the tax it paid under protest. Nor can it qualify for injunctive relief, because its subscription sales are no longer taxed. Hence, Texas contends, appellant cannot show that it has suffered or is threatened with redressable injury, which this Court declared to be a pre-requisite for standing in Valley Forge Christian College v.

{"label": "NEG", "text": "The title of Bonnie Farmer\u2019s easygoing, 1930s Montreal tale about a girl named Mildred whose musically gifted next-door playmate is a boy named Oscar Peterson is a clear nod to ,Beethoven Lives Upstairs,, the audio-recording/book/movie phenomenon from the early 1990s. But the reference is more than just a superficially cheeky indulgence: in the annals of Canadian jazz, Peterson is surely our Beethoven.,The fathers of Mildred (depicted by illustrator Marie Lafrance in cornrows and a variety of colourful smock dresses) and Oscar both work as porters on the railway, the tracks of which encircle their predominantly black, working-class neighbourhood in Saint-Henri. Though Mildred\u2019s dad complains about the incessant trumpet playing that keeps him awake most nights, the little girl secretly enjoys \u201cOscar\u2019s lullaby.\u201d When the \u201croot-a-toot-tooting\u201d suddenly stops, it\u2019s not because Mildred\u2019s dad has run interference, it\u2019s because Oscar has contracted tuberculosis. Now it\u2019s Mildred who is unable to sleep.,Months later, Oscar finally returns from hospital (where he developed a case of selective mutism), but his compromised lungs necessitate a switch from trumpet to piano. In an indirect homage to the musical genre for which Peterson eventually became famous, Farmer gives us a conclusion that\u2019s satisfying, but open-ended.,Oscar Lives Next Door, has none of the pretentiousness that often plagues books attempting to teach children about art or \u201cimportant\u201d cultural figures.", "group": "BREVIEW", "id": 12387}

Indeed, Adams writes that the results of the U.S. election prompted him to go to his office and demand the results of a major poll of Canadians and Americans, in an effort to retroactively understand Trump\u2019s triumph.,In the book, Adams highlights a number of factors that appear to have been related to Trump\u2019s election victory \u2013 immigration, the treatment of Muslims, economics, inequality, and democratic institutions. In each case, the distinctions between the two countries are less clear than many Canadians might think. On Islamophobia, for example, Canadians tell pollsters they are less fearful of Muslims than is the case in the U.S., but the murder of six people at a mosque in Quebec City in January was a more violent attack on Muslims than anything that has happened to date south of the border.,Adams comes to the conclusion that our preference for compromise over conflict represents the major difference between Canadians and Americans, and this societal factor may make it difficult for right-wing populists to succeed as thoroughly here as they have down south.

She has just enough flaws mixed in with her fierce loyalty and kind heart to make her both likable and believable. Signy\u2019s connection with Elena is quick and intense, though her ability to bolster the young woman\u2019s spirits becomes increasingly strained as they learn more about Volkov\u2019s dangerous past.", "group": "BREVIEW", "id": 12714}

As the graduating-valve of the Boyden patent practically does all the work in ordinary cases, and the poppet-valve is only called into action in emergency cases, the latter is practically an auxiliary valve, by which, we understand, not necessarily an independent valve, nor one of a particular construction, but simply a valve which in emergency cases is called into the assistance of the graduating-valve. In this particular, the poppet-valve of the Boyden device performs practically the same function as the slide-valve 41 of the Westinghouse.

But however that may be, it is clear to our minds that, as it stood originally as part of \u00a7 57 after 1873, and as it stands now in the Revised Statutes, it operates as a prohibition upon all attachments against national banks under the authority of the state courts. That was evidently its purpose when first enacted, for then it was part of a section which, while providing for suits in the courts of the United States or of the State, as the plaintiff might elect, declared in express terms that if the suit was begun in a state court no attachment should issue until after judgment. The form of its re\u00ebnactment in the Revised Statutes does not change its meaning in this particular.

The title story elaborates a small, callous act of pedestrian rage, which occurs when a woman walking through an airport cannot abide someone stopping suddenly in front of her to hug a loved one: a lack of empathy blown up to entertainingly pathological proportions.,In the wonderful piece \u201cEmpathize or Die,\u201d Westhead shows the ways in which empathy also has its dangers, in the person of Dennis, an odd man who stumbles into an open-mic night at a caf\u00e9 and relates too much to everyone and everything around him, losing himself in successive deliriums that verge on the surreal. Though \u201cEmpathize or Die\u201d represents Westhead\u2019s furthest extension of the theme, over and over this book presents characters who temper their own actions, personal needs, or dreams in gestures of unfortunate compromise.,While these stories announce a key to the book, this central concern also informs the final four pieces, which read like a mini story-cycle about children.", "group": "BREVIEW", "id": 13384}

Her real talk on body image is as on point as her how-to guide on eating in bed (key takeaways: use a plate to avoid crumbs and don\u2019t bring in a full jar of hummus lest you stink up the room).,You might not learn much from her poem about cheese or her ,Buzzfeed,-like quiz on which of her past fashion mistakes you are (although you\u2019ll definitely have a good laugh over both), but Heisey also shares some clever words of hard-earned wisdom on subjects such as the importance of taking care of yourself\u00a0 and how to break up with someone without being a jerk.
