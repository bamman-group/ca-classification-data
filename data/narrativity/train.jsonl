{"label": "NEG", "text": "\"Intellectual Beauty\" (as a phrase) is then both more and less Platonic. For, as is evinced by the chronology of the poem's composition, it is born out of Shelley's own work, only to converge with Plato at a later date. That the phrase \"Intellectual Beauty,\" moreover, only appears in the \"Hymn's\" title, as though it were a leftover or supernumerary of the text, further exacerbates this already tenuous relation between the poem and the Platonic tradition. Yet for all of these difficulties, Shelley's title nevertheless suffices to articulate a bond that no amount of disapproval, dissuasion, or disavowal would be capable of fully denying, and not only because of the possibility that Shelley had read Plato's Symposium prior to composing the \"Hymn,\" nor, conversely, simply because he may have translated the Symposium with his \"Hymn\" in mind.\" Nor, moreover, is this even because of the potential that \"Intellectual Beauty\"-again as a phrase-seems to offer for the Platonic idiom.", "group": "LITSTUDY", "id": 135}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "This proposition that, in effect, subjects the domain of biological life to the work of the moral life of humans marks, I argue, a critical turning point for the humanities today, as it departs radically from a tradition\u2014inaugurated by, among others, Immanuel Kant\u2014that made a strict separation between our \u201cmoral\u201d and \u201canimal\u201d (i.e., biological) lives, assuming that the latter would always be taken care of by the natural order of things. This separation, after all, is what has buttressed for more than a century the much-critiqued gap between the humanities and the physical or biological sciences. Strands of environmentalist thought have questioned and on occasions attempted to close this chasm, but the gap persists and has not been easy to overcome. However, to ask, as we do today, how humans might use the resources of their moral capacity to regulate their life as a biosocial species among other species, is to bring within the ambit of human moral life something that has always lain outside of its scope: the history of natural life on the planet. The assumption\u2014made since at least the Enlightenment\u2014that our animal life could take care of itself while we struggled, consciously, in search of a collective moral life is now under serious strain, with serious implications for the humanities that have traditionally served as the domain for the discussion of moral issues in separation from biological life.", "group": "LITSTUDY", "id": 137}

For this reason, however, Root tends to wale in his rationale for using verse, describing it sometimes as sugar for the medicine but at other times as an encumbrance on his poem's spiritual message. In his preface, for example, Root explains that he has opted to compose in a catchy four-beat stanza so as to make his difficult subject more approachable: because the works of Hardy and Rhys Davids are \"beyond the reach of the mass of readers,\" he has \"epitomized, and brought within the scope of the masses (to whom those volumes are inaccessible) all that is needed to form a correct biographical narrative\" of Gautama.

At the base of this social mechanism lay individual traumatic experience, yet this experience was taken up, modified, and mediated by public language and public silence, which qualitatively modified its significance before passing it back to the individual in a new form. The model of social being produced in such a manner is variegated, relying on the conflation of individual and collective wounds in public language to generate social rituals and forms of subjectivity capacious enough to bind together perpetrators and victims, the complicit and the innocent, the patriot and the cowed in one political unity. As this case illustrates, the extension of psychoanalytic terms to analysis of social processes is a delicate matter; collective trauma is a metaphor describing a social phenomenon, as is collective disavowal.

Twice in these directions he merely stands still, the first time \"tiefsinnig\" [\"deep in thought\"], while the third time he strides, agitated, across the room before stopping again and standing. In each section, Wallenstein takes into consideration a different aspect of his doomed situation, using varying sets of imagery and repetition in each, coming finally to his decision to ally with the Swedish forces, a decision which condemns him but without which he likely is to fail, if not die, anyway. The first section of the monologue employs careful word choice focused on the stem \"schlo\u00df\" in combination with repeated imagery of physical confinement that is said to result from mental liberties Wallenstein took earlier. In each of the final three sections of the monologue, he employs at least one polyptoton to express fundamentally irresolvable sets of conditions in which he finds himself: in the second, a polyptoton around the stem \"plan\" depicting the role of outside perception, over which he has no control, that forms a tangible reality which he now must negotiate; in the third, a polyptoton around the stem \"Not\" that expresses a dichotomy between what is demanded of Wallenstein and what he has just concluded to do, what he may not be capable of carrying out in the present adversity; and finally, two polyptota in the fourth section around the stem \"gemein\" and the verb \"gelten\" which drive to the heart of Wallenstein's challenge in relation to acting heroically, to founding a new order, to fighting for purchase in a wholly different moment in time.", "group": "LITSTUDY", "id": 1076}

They functioned in this system simultaneously as commodities for sale and as the reserve deposits of a loosely organized, decentered, but vast trans-Atlantic banking system: deposits made at the moment of sale and instantly reconverted into short-term bonds. This means that fundamental to the slave trade was a process of actuarial abstraction and dehumanizing typification (each slave typified a unit of capital), which Baucom suggests was at the heart of the eighteenth-century novel's project as well. Hence the novel, a certain kind of historicism, finance capital, and slavery are all in this view of a piece, in which the novel and historicism's deployment of human particularity in the service of a general abstract significance perform an epistemological variant of the violence inflicted more directly by slavery and capitalism.

The word \"useless\" has been read as a pejorative, as if Heaney were despairing over Ledwidge's self-division and alienation, but the assertion \"all the strains / Criss-cross in useless equilibrium\" might encapsulate something important about poetry for Heaney: in it, he affirms the purposiveless purpose of art, as Kant called it, the refusal to submit the conflicted texture of his poetry to political or national causes. Not that Heaney's poetry is altogether apolitical. Part of the power of a poem such as the Ledwidge elegy is its ability to make peace between old wartime antagonists, such as Owen and Yeats, an Englishman and an Irishman, as Owen and other First World War era poets such as Hardy, Rosenberg, Service, and Owen had done before him. Engaging literary ancestors from the era of the First World War, Heaney's elegy foregrounds poetry as a space in which cultural and national differences can be straddled and negotiated.", "group": "LITSTUDY", "id": 1505}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Eastman's translations of the nation form into Dakota terms through writings that sought to undercut the designative authority of United States law had the effect of asserting the primacy of indigenous ethics as a longstanding and legitimate basis for sovereign political action. In writing about the past, Eastman pointed to the failures of a national model that was founded on a temporality of abstract capital and on liberal assumptions about the necessity of individual ownership of property, an ownership that has lacked certain ethical protections offered by consensus politics based in a relational cosmology. The grossly unequal distribution of wealth, the graft, and a Christianity evacuated of communitarian concern that Eastman observed in his life up to the publication of From the Deep Woods find a powerful tribal retort in his animal stories. Their commitment to an acknowledgment of and respect for persons of various kinds out of a sense of the power inherent in alterity, and their commitment to an ethic of reciprocal gifting, constitutes a model of peoplehood (and, by extension, nationhood) that was and remains relevant as an alternative to the nation- state and its tendency to abuse its power. In constructing a tacit theory of political legitimacy that recognizes multiple national centers\u2014indeed, a vast field of nations made up of human and animal collectives\u2014Eastman suggests not just the critically corrective potential of Dakota philosophy and forms of governance for non-Native society but also their rehabilitative role for tribal communities in the ongoing work of decolonization.", "group": "LITSTUDY", "id": 1546}

The latter was ideally suited for a fundamental critique of capitalism or modernity. The second and third generation of Frankfurt School critical theorists wanted to move their social analysis away from such sweeping philosophies of history, but the concept of intersubjectivity could only be useful as a possible alternative, if it could still provide a normative basis for a social critique. Going beyond Mead, the concept of intersubjectivity was thus linked to social relations characterized by symmetry and genuine reciprocity\u2014which had as one of its consequences that reading literature would not qualify. Moreover, the models of successfully achieved intersubjectivity provided by Habermas and Honneth, the ideal speech situation and an empathetic parent-child relation, did not exactly fire up the radical imaginary of revisionist literary and cultural studies and seemed to move away from present-day concerns (such as, to give but one example, race and gender).", "group": "LITSTUDY", "id": 1671}

The first intimation of will in the action marks a much more fundamental stage of voluntarism and technical capacity than Benois's concept of conscious desire admits: it occurs with the auto-activation of the marionettes, when all their limbs jerk spasmodically- jolted into life, so it seems, by the magician, their faces inexpressive, as if demonstrating the reflexes that, Huxley showed, existed without consciousness. By the second tableau, the agency of the fiat (to use James's concept) has passed from the magician to the automata themselves, who now show signs of possessing ideational nerve tracts, not just automatic tendencies. Just as the moving automata in Coppelius's workshop represent a technological animation of the sculptural figure, the autonomous behavior of the figures in the second tableau indicates an advance beyond the insentient and passive condition of the marionette. So if the backstage travails of Fokine's marionettes signal the existence of volition and desire, as Benois believed, the sequence of the tableaux illustrates a physiological certainty, one that even the ambivalent James accepted: muscular movement comes before consciousness.", "group": "LITSTUDY", "id": 1743}

[Autists] define a new locus of action, a passage where autists and non-autists can cross; an interface where the increased tension between concrete and linguistic extremes begins to dissolve by way of linguistic manoeuvres, which aim to steer a middle course between meaning and matter.

It is possible that Henry and Elizabeth had preempted their nuptial vows; as we have seen, once a precontract was made, it was acceptable for couples to consummate their union, after which society regarded them as legally wed. Elizabeth had been honored as Queen from December 1485, so maybe she and Henry began sleeping together at that time. Many couples of lesser rank did not bother with a formal marriage ceremony, but for royalty, of course, it was crucial for the avoidance of doubt over the succession. Even if the King and Queen had waited until after their wedding, their child might have been only about two to three weeks premature. However, other evidence tends to corroborate the statement that he was born at eight months, and suggests that Bacon and Fuller were making flattering assumptions; the accounts of the bishops of Winchester for 1486\u20138742 show that the prince\u2019s nursery household was established for at least the first six months of his life at Farnham, Surrey, halfway between Winchester and London, because he was weak and needed careful nursing until he was strong enough to be moved to London and the palaces of the Thames Valley.", "group": "BIO", "id": 2125}

Thus it is clear that William Carey was never lord of the manor of Aldenham, nor is there any record of him owning or residing in a house in the village, or ever living there.72 There is in fact no mention of any Carey living there before 1589. The likelihood is that William and Mary resided at court during their marriage. On the assumption that Mary was less than twelve years old at the time of her wedding, it has been argued that the consummation of her marriage was \u201cundoubtedly delayed\u201d for some time, which is said to account for the fact that the couple\u2019s first child was not born until 1524.73 Yet this theory does not take into account the evidence that she was Fran\u00e7ois I\u2019s mistress around 1514\u201315, or the likely date of Anne Boleyn\u2019s birth and the fact that Mary was the elder sister, which all suggests that she was probably at least twenty at the time of her marriage, and that it was duly consummated.

Such a view of history is indispensable to understanding capitalism as a world-historical phenomenon; it illuminates in particular the universalist ambition of capitalist modernity, which seeks precisely to colonize history and make it into its prehistory, the story of its own, implicitly necessary and implacable coming into being.

The questions I have chosen to pursue are those of scale, and of agency, with a final short section on the temporal perspective offered by the single  day before I conclude. In the first section, I consider the role played by the focus on detail enabled by the single day form as well as the apparent problems arising from this focus for a definition of the one-day novel as a text of the everyday. I then offer a proposed solution to this problem by considering the significance of the day\u2019s comparability with other days, developed through Jean-Luc Nancy\u2019s concept of \u201ccompearance.\u201d In the second section, I begin by reflecting on the failure of the one-day novel in general to address the working day; move on to ask how one-day novels pursue questions prompted by the Marxist focus on what can be done in a day (particularly from a feminist perspective); and then consider how the \u201cevent\u201d has been articulated in recent writing on literature and the everyday, suggesting that the one-day novel might challenge both the valorization of the \u201cevent\u201d and nuance its conceptualisztion.

This is what the Valgrand episode in the first installment of the Fant\u00f4mas serial does. Throughout the episode, Valgrand's melodramatic theatrical performance is tacitly contrasted to the unmarked, professional, and \"realistic\" acting of Ren\u00e9 Navarre as Fant\u00f4mas and Valgrand, and thus serves to distinguish the cinematic mode of representation and impersonation from the older system of the theatrical grand guignol as well as to draw the spectator's attention to the vast scope of possibilities of the filmic medium.

While rejecting William Wallace for the economic and social ascendancy myth of Dick Whittington appears to signal indifference to romantic ideas of Scottish nationhood, the text resolves Claud's status obsession into the most intransigent kind of national idealism, an inflexible grand narrative that imbibes the charged feudal romance of Whittington's archetypal rise. Fixating on a hollowed-out version of his cultural inheritance, he misses the human, sympathetic element that could have sutured the national condition, inviting in a dark version of Scottishness that haunts the text thenceforth. In ideological terms, he steps beyond the critical paradigm of theoretical history in engaging with the substance of romance at all, but the situation is rendered truly ruinous by the impersonal, debased version that Claud brings to the narrative, permanently souring the unfolding of historical detail. Thus, while Balwhidder's flexible and sympathetic imposition of \"story\" via his religion proves a harmless superfluity in modern Scotland, Claud's invocation of a static and iconic form of imagined nationhood brings catastrophic results for the nation as family.", "group": "LITSTUDY", "id": 3392}

The King also had one acknowledged bastard son by Elizabeth Blount, and evidence that will be presented later in this chapter strongly suggests that he also had two bastard daughters, both of whom married and bore children. By the time Henry married his three last wives, he was prematurely aging, ailing, and grossly obese; a report by the French ambassador, Charles de Marillac, that his fifth queen, Katherine Howard, was enceinte was probably unfounded, as we hear no more of it.

It was just a prodigy to see how calmly Mr Cayenne acted on that occasion; for, being at other times as crabbed as a wud terrier, folk were afraid to tell him, till he came out himself in the morning and saw the devastation; at the sight of which he gave only a shrill whistle, and began to laugh at the idea of the men fearing to take him the news, as if he had not fortune and philosophy enough, as he called it, to withstand much greater misfortunes. CHAPTER XXXVIII YEAR 1797\n\nWhen I have seen in my walks the irrational creatures of God, the birds and the beasts, governed by a kindly instinct in attendance on their young, often has it come into my head that love and charity, far more than reason or justice, formed the tie that holds the world, with all its jarring wants and woes, in social dependence and obligation together; and, in this year, a strong verification of the soundness of this notion was exemplified in the conduct of the poor haverel lassie Meg Gaffaw, whose naturality on the occasion of her mother's death I have related at length in this chronicle. In the course of the summer, Mr Henry Melcomb, who was a nephew to Mr Cayenne, came down from England to see his uncle.
