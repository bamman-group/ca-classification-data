{"label": "NEG", "text": "Purpose Integrated supply chain in pharmaceutical industry requires organized planning and modeling of each strategic element of pharmaceutical supply chain (PSC). The aim is to coordinate each activity of PSC and design a robust strategy to make the system hassle-free. Each activity of industry is interdependent and follows certain co-relations with each other. The paper focuses on the four most significant identified issues in PSC and analyses the weightages of these issues and their sub issues with respect to cost incurred and time taken to manage whole chain of supply. Design/methodology/approach Fuzzy analytical hierarchy process methodology has been applied to rank the issues which consume maximum time and/or costs. Findings The derived result shows that warehouse design and management (WDM) consumes more than one third of the total time and around half of the total cost. Other than WDM, process of supplier selection for procurement is second most time and cost consuming issue. The derived results are discussed and provided to the field experts of the area. The analysis will be useful for decision makers to economize PSC. Research limitations/implications The study is limited to PSC; hence, result may vary with other practical situations. Practical implications This generated scope for further research on how to minimize the weightage of WDM for cost and time in PSC industry so that decision-makers can optimize the economic system of PSC. Originality/value The research is based on the field survey of India's largest generic medicine distributing company in the government sector; hence, analysis has been performed on real situation.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 4191}

Design/methodology/approach Two between-participants factorial design experiments (n = 176 for Study 1 and n = 169 for Study 2) were conducted to examine consumers' responses to a brand's cost transparency and production transparency. Findings The results revealed that transparency in the focal brand's communication of production and cost would increase consumers' perceptions of the brand's transparency and authenticity because of its perceived information sensitivity.

The gastrointestinal tract was the most common source of sepsis. Mean blood pressure prior to resuscitation was 50 +/- 8 mm Hg. All dogs were given IV fluids before vasopressor therapy with a mean rate of 12.1 +/- 11.0 mL/kg/h. All dogs were given antimicrobials, administered within a mean of 4.3 +/- 5.7 hours after diagnosis. Dopamine or norepinephrine was administered IV, respectively in 51.3% and 37.8% of dogs, with a mean duration of hypotension of 2.6 +/- 3.0 hours. Mortality rate was 81.1%.

{"label": "NEG", "text": "The last decades have seen a tremendous amount of research being devoted to effectively managing vehicle fleets and minimizing empty mileage. However, in contrast to, e.g., the air transport sector, the question of how to best assign crews to vehicles, has received very little attention in the road transport sector. The vast majority of road freight transport in Europe is conducted by single drivers and team driving is often only conducted if there are special circumstances, e.g., security concerns. While it is clear that transport companies want to avoid the costs related to additional drivers, vehicles manned by a single driver sit unused whenever the driver takes a mandatory break or rest. Team drivers, on the other hand, can travel a much greater distance in the same amount of time, because mandatory breaks and rests are required less frequently. This paper investigates under which conditions trucking companies should use single or team driving to maximize their profitability. We present a novel optimization approach for simultaneously optimizing routes and crewing decisions and provide experimental evidence that, for a wide range of cost factors, operating a fleet with a mix of team and single drivers can significantly reduce operational costs when compared to typical profit margins in the sector.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 4230}

Homer, however, evidently understood this point quite well, whether by art or instinct, just in the same way as he excels the rest in every other respect.

Nevertheless, it is unclear whether delayed tooth movement can be recovered by encouraging smoking cessation. The study was designed to examine whether tooth movement rates can be recovered by a period of smoking cessation in rats treated with a comprehensive mixture of tobacco smoke components (TSCs). Materials and methods: Nine-week-old Wistar male rats were divided into no treatment, sham, TSCs, and TSCs cessation groups. The rats in the no treatment and sham groups drank distilled water, whereas those in the TSCs group and the TSCs cessation groups received TSCs in their drinking water. A smoking cessation period of 10 days was set for rats in the TSCs cessation group before the three groups underwent tooth movement. Tooth movement distance was measured using micro-computed tomography, and osteoclast differentiation was evaluated histologically. Results: There was significantly greater tooth movement in the sham and TSCs cessation groups than in the TSCs group. However, the TSCs cessation group showed lesser osteoclast differentiation than the sham group. Conclusion: Our results indicate that delayed tooth movement caused by smoking was recovered by smoking cessation treatment; this recovery seems to be partially due to the increase in osteoclasts, although the number of osteoclasts was still less than that in the sham group.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 4246}

Several studies have described transcriptomic or proteomic models of reaction wood relative to the opposite wood. However, the mechanisms leading to the formation of reaction wood are difficult to decipher because so many environmental factors can induce various signalling pathways leading to this developmental reprogramming. Using an innovative isotropic device where the phototropic response does not interfere with gravistimulation we characterized the early molecular responses occurring in the stem of poplar after gravistimulation in an isotropic environment, and without deformation of the stem. After 30 min tilting at 35 degrees under anisotropic light, we collected the upper and lower xylems from the inclined stems. Controls were collected from vertical stems. We used a microarray approach to identify differentially expressed transcripts. High-throughput real-time PCR allowed a kinetic experiment at 0, 30, 120 and 180 min after tilting at 35 degrees, with candidate genes. We identified 668 differentially expressed transcripts, from which we selected 153 candidates for additional Fluidigm qPCR assessment. Five candidate co-expression gene clusters have been identified after the kinetic monitoring of the expression of candidate genes. Gene ontology analyses indicate that molecular reprogramming of processes such as 'wood cell expansion', 'cell wall reorganization' and 'programmed cell death' occur as early as 30 min after gravistimulation. Of note is that the change in the expression of different genes involves a fine regulation of gibberellin and brassinosteroid pathways as well as flavonoid and phosphoinositide pathways. Our experimental set-up allowed the identification of genes regulated in early gravitropic response without the bias introduced by phototropic and stem bending responses.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 4256}

Based on this, redescriptions and/or emended species diagnoses are provided for Echinoderes aureus, E. dujardinii, E. gerardi, E. imperforatus, E. pacificus, E. pilosus, E. sensibilis, E. sublicarum and E. worthingi, and new details about cuticular structures are added for E. kozloffi and E. gizoensis. The new information derived from the redescriptions, and the subsequent comparative studies revealed that: 1) the holotype of Echinoderes lanceolatus is identical with the types of Echinoderes aureus, and E. lanceolatus is thus a junior synonym of E. aureus; other potentially synonymous species that should be addressed further in the future include: E. dujardinii + E. gerardi; E. imperforatus + E. sensibilis, and E. pacificus + E. sublicarum; 2) the paratypes of E. lanceolatus represented a different yet undescribed species, here described as E. songae Sorensen & Chang sp. nov.; 3) a comparison with literature information about E. ehlersi showed that the species is so insufficiently described that a redescription of topotype material is required before the species should be considered for taxonomic comparison; 4) specimens from the Andaman Islands, India, that previously have been reported as Echinoderes cf. ehlersi represent two different undescribed species, of which one is described as E. chandrasekharai Sorensen & Chatterjee sp. nov. and the other is left undescribed due to the limited material available; 5) out of a total of fifteen addressed species, it is proposed that eleven represent a putatively monophyletic group that is named the Echinoderes dujardinii group. The group includes following species: E. dujardinii, E. ehlersi, E. gerardi, E. imperforatus, E. kozloffi, E. sensibilis, E. pacificus, E. sublicarum, E. songae Sorensen & Chang sp. nov., E. chandrasekharai Sorensen & Chatterjee sp. nov., and Echinoderes sp. from the Andaman Islands, and is supported by a similar spine/tube pattern (except for variation regarding the presence of lateral accessory tubes on segment 8); generally short middorsal spines, especially on segments 4 to 6; glandular cell outlets type 1 always present in middorsal positions on segments 1 to 3, and in subdorsal positions on segments 4 to 9; glandular cell outlets type 2 always present in laterodorsal or midlateral positions on segment 8, and sometimes in same positions on segment 9 but never at any other segments or positions; female papillae always present on sternal plates of segments 7 and 8, and occasionally also on segment 6; tergal extensions well-spaced, triangular, gradually tapered cones, and pectinate fringes of sternal extensions are differentiated into seta-like tufts. The comparisons furthermore showed potential taxonomic significance of two echinoderid character traits that previously have been slightly neglected as diagnostic traits, namely the presence and appearance of female papillae, and the dorsal pattern of glandular cell outlets type 1. Female papillae may occur on the sternal plates of segments 6 to 8, but the positions may differ from ventrolateral to ventromedial, and the morphology of the intracuticular substructure also differ at species level. Information about position and morphology of female papillae proved helpful for species recognition, but it might also provide information of phylogenetic importance. Analyses of glandular cell outlet type 1 patterns on the dorsal sides of segments 1 to 9 in species of Echinoderidae, revealed several apparently unique or rare patterns, but also three distinct patterns that applied to larger groups of species. One pattern is the one present in all species of the E. dujardinii group, whereas the other two common patterns included 1) middorsal outlets on segments 1 to 3, and paradorsal outlets on segments 4 to 9 (found in 27 species), and 2) middorsal outlets on segments 1 to 3, 5 and 7, and paradorsal outlets on segments 4, 6 and 8 to 9 (found in 27 species).", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 4274}

In that light, this study sets out to analyse the discourses of fake news as advanced by states. Results from a critical discourse analysis of articles relating to fake news (n = 450) from four countries - Cambodia, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam - reveal four key findings: first, fake news is being framed as an existential security issue that directly threatens foundational societal values. Second, fake news as an issue is constructed as a new and unprecedented contemporary problem, and compared on equal terms to other security threats such as terrorism, chemical attacks and cyberwarfare. Third, the threat of fake news is used to justify the passing of broad-reaching legislation and curbs on free speech that are construed as aligned with global democratic norms.

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Introduction The high-type anorectal malformations (ARM) are conventionally managed by an initial left iliac fossa sigmoid colostomy, followed by laparoscopic anorectoplasty (LARP). Such a stoma occupies left half of the infraumbilical region and hinders the LARP ergonomics, leading to the surgeon's discomfort. We studied the outcome and impact of \"lateralizing\" (shifting laterally in the abdominal wall) the colostomy on port ergonomics. Materials and Methods This prospective study was conducted in the pediatric surgery unit of a medical college in central India between March 2014 and June 2017 in two parts. In the first part of the study, neonates with high ARM were block randomized in two groups: conventional colostomy (CC) in left iliac fossa and lateral colostomy (LC, laterally placed abdominal colostomy). Outcomes of colostomy were compared among these two groups. In the second part of the study, 40 consecutive infants from both types of colostomy groups underwent ergonomic comparison and assessment of the surgeon's discomfort during LARP (CC-LARP and LC-LARP). Standard statistical tests were used for comparison. Results In the first part of the study, 203 ARM cases were included in this study; 100 underwent CC and 103 underwent LC. Colostomy prolapse, excoriation, reversed stoma, and short distal limb were significantly higher in the CC group. In the second part of the study, the LC-LARP group showed many significant advantages over the CC-LARP group, including less peri-stomal adhesions, better vision, shorter operative time, and better ergonomics (better manipulation, elevation, and azimuth angles). The LC-LARP also significantly reduced the surgeon's discomfort. Conclusion Lateralization of high-sigmoid colostomy should be preferred over left iliac fossa sigmoid colostomy for ARM, as it improves the port ergonomics and reduces the surgeon's discomfort for second stage LARP.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 4305}

The intra-hepatic Umbilical-Porto-Systemic Venous Shunt (IHUPSVS) causes a reduction of the umbilical blood flow to the liver and has been reported to have a restrictive effect on fetal growth. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of IHUPSVS on fetal growth. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study of IHUPSVS diagnosed between 2001 and 2019. IHUPSVS was defined as any abnormal communication between any branch of the portal vein and hepatic vein. Pre- and postnatal characteristics were collected from medical files and compared between cases with fetal growth restriction (FGR) and those appropriate for gestational age (AGA). Results Twenty-five fetuses were included in the study. Eighteen (72%) had last estimated fetal weight and birth weight below the 10th centile, four (16%) of them between the third and fifth centile, and 11 (44%) below the third centile. Median gestational age at delivery was lower for FGR than AGA fetuses (37 vs. 38 weeks, p = 0.034) and rate of preterm delivery was higher (38.9 vs. 14.3, P = 0.24). Four cases had associated structural anomalies (2 in each group), and two had minor genetic aberrations (1 in each group).

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Purpose The authors examine the association between internal control quality (ICQ) and voluntary disclosure and test whether chief executive officer (CEO) duality, as a proxy for CEO structural power, moderates such a relationship in an emerging market (Egypt). Design/methodology/approach ICQ is measured using a survey of external auditors, while a content analysis approach is used to measure the level of voluntary disclosure in annual reports. Findings Based on a sample of 512 firm-year observations over the period of 2007-2014, the authors document that ICQ is positively and significantly associated with voluntary disclosure, suggesting that better controls improve corporate reporting policy. In addition, CEO duality moderates the association between ICQ and voluntary disclosure since this positive relationship association becomes insignificant for companies characterised by CEO duality. These results remain stable after controlling for endogeneity (self-selection problem), political instability and industry characteristics. Research limitations/implications The findings of the study provide preliminary evidence on the association between ICQ and voluntary disclosure, and how CEO structural power may affect this association. Future empirical investigations may extend this work to cover the relationship between ICQ and other attributes of corporate transparency including earnings quality and accounting conservatism. Practical implications The findings highlight the need for Egyptian regulators to enact new rules obliging firms to communicate information about ICQ or charging auditors to report information about firm's ICQ in their reports. The results also alert policymakers about the adverse effect of combined leadership structure (CEO duality) since it mitigates the positive impact of ICQ on voluntary disclosure. Originality/value The authors contribute to internal control literature by exploring the association between ICQ and voluntary disclosure on an emergent unregulated market with respect to internal control disclosure.

However, physiological motion and large geometric distortions due to main B-0 field inhomogeneities degrade the image quality, reduce the accuracy of quantitative imaging markers, and impede their subsequent clinical applicability. Purpose To retrospectively correct for geometric distortion for free-breathing DW-MRI of the kidneys at 3T, in the presence of a nonstatic distortion field due to breathing and bulk motion. Study Type Prospective. Subjects Ten healthy volunteers (ages 29-38, four females). Field Strength/Sequence 3T; DW-MR dual-echo echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence (10 b-values and 17 directions) and a T-2 volume. Assessment The distortion correction was evaluated subjectively (Likert scale 0-5) and numerically with cross-correlation between the DW images at b = 0 s/mm(2) and a T-2 volume. The intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) and diffusion tensor (DTI) model-fitting performance was evaluated using the root-mean-squared error (nRMSE) and the coefficient of variation (CV%) of their parameters. Statistical Tests Statistical comparisons were done using Wilcoxon tests. Results The proposed method improved the Likert scores by 1.1 +/- 0.8 (P < 0.05), the cross-correlation with the T-2 reference image by 0.13 +/- 0.05 (P < 0.05), and reduced the nRMSE by 0.13 +/- 0.03 (P < 0.05) and 0.23 +/- 0.06 (P < 0.05) for IVIM and DTI, respectively. The CV% of the IVIM parameters (slow and fast diffusion, and diffusion fraction for IVIM and mean diffusivity, and fractional anisotropy for DTI) was reduced by 2.26 +/- 3.98% (P = 6.971 x 10(-2)), 11.24 +/- 26.26% (P = 6.971 x 10(-2)), 4.12 +/- 12.91% (P = 0.101), 3.22 +/- 0.55% (P < 0.05), and 2.42 +/- 1.15% (P < 0.05).

However, little is known about aging, lifestyle and genetic factors influencing mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) abundance. In this study, mtDNA abundance was estimated from the weighted intensities of probes mapping to the MT genome in 295,150 participants from the UK Biobank. We found that the abundance of mtDNA was significantly elevated in women compared to men, was negatively correlated with advanced age, higher smoking exposure, greater body-mass index, higher frailty index as well as elevated red and white blood cell count and lower mortality. In addition, several biochemistry markers in blood-related to cholesterol metabolism, ion homeostasis and kidney function were found to be significantly associated with mtDNA abundance. By performing a genome-wide association study, we identified 50 independent regions genome-wide significantly associated with mtDNA abundance which harbour multiple genes involved in the immune system, cancer as well as mitochondrial function. Using mixed effects models, we estimated the SNP-heritability of mtDNA abundance to be around 8%. To investigate the consequence of altered mtDNA abundance, we performed a phenome-wide association study and found that mtDNA abundance is involved in risk for leukaemia, hematologic diseases as well as hypertension.

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Recent studies have combined multiple neuroimaging modalities to gain further understanding of the neurobiological substrates of aphasia. Following this line of work, the current study uses machine learning approaches to predict aphasia severity and specific language measures based on a multimodal neuroimaging dataset. A total of 116 individuals with chronic left-hemisphere stroke were included in the study. Neuroimaging data included task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), diffusion-based fractional anisotropy (FA)-values, cerebral blood flow (CBF), and lesion-load data. The Western Aphasia Battery was used to measure aphasia severity and specific language functions. As a primary analysis, we constructed support vector regression (SVR) models predicting language measures based on (i) each neuroimaging modality separately, (ii) lesion volume alone, and (iii) a combination of all modalities. Prediction accuracy across models was subsequently statistically compared. Prediction accuracy across modalities and language measures varied substantially (predicted vs. empirical correlation range: r = .00-.67). The multimodal prediction model yielded the most accurate prediction in all cases (r = .53-.67). Statistical superiority in favor of the multimodal model was achieved in 28/30 model comparisons (p-value range: <.001-.046). Our results indicate that different neuroimaging modalities carry complementary information that can be integrated to more accurately depict how brain damage and remaining functionality of intact brain tissue translate into language function in aphasia.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 4340}

A directional covariance matrix control chart is proposed, which fully exploits directional shift information and borrows the strong power of likelihood ratio test. Therefore, this chart provides a powerful tool for monitoring covariance matrices. In addition, the proposed chart does not require specifying the regularisation parameter, and it enjoys a concise quadratic form, thereby easy to implement. Furthermore, this chart naturally leads to a diagnostic prescription for identifying the shifting element in the covariance matrix.

This quasi-experimental study was aimed at evaluating knowledge, attitudes and self-efficacy among PHPs after participating in a Knowledge, Attitude, and Self-efficacy (KAS) program for identification and management of perinatal depressive symptoms. Method The KAS-program, carried through in Sakonnakhon in north-eastern Thailand, comprised one day of theory and a four-week period of field practice. Thirty-three PHPs from PCCs participated in the program. Twenty-three of them participated in focus group discussions (FGDs). Chi-square for trend, paired-sample T-tests and content analysis were used. Results Knowledge, attitude and self-efficacy scores increased after the PHPs had fully participated in the KAS-program. Four categories emerged from the FGDs: increased understanding and knowledge, being aware and having a positive attitude, having confidence and ability to work, and need of regular training and feedback. Conclusion The KAS-program may contribute to giving PHPs in PCCs the knowledge, positive attitude and self-efficacy they need to identify and manage perinatal depressive symptoms.

Design/methodology/approach The paper adopts a Web-based self-completion survey by achieving a total of 529 completed surveys. Then, structural equation modeling has been employed by using SPSS AMOS. Findings Results highlighted how the brand characteristics of self-expressiveness, innovativeness and authenticity have a positive influence on brand addiction; brand addiction leads consumers to feel emotions of irritability and to adopt obsessive and compulsive behaviors toward the brand. Research limitations/implications Even if the choice of using a survey's sample composed of students attending an Italian University ensures good internal validity of research (owing to the homogeneous character), the results are not generalizable (except for this population group). Practical implications The study identified two different spheres of brand addiction (one connected to the brand's characteristics and the other to the consumers' psychological-behavioral outcomes), along with possible strategies firms could adopt to strengthen the possibilities to transform their customers into addicted ones and to avoid/reduce the negative consequences deriving from brand addiction. Originality/value The paper provides a response to the call for more studies into the brand addiction analysis by empirically testing possible antecedents and outcomes, thus enriching the existing quantitative research focused on this concept.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 4380}

Unlike images, the existing datasets for other types of input, such as vibration-based damage data, are relatively smaller, less diverse, and highly imbalanced. Therefore, the reliability of data-driven models developed for safety-critical assessments can be questionable. This paper proposes a dual Bayesian inference where damage predictions are accompanied by measuring the model's confidence in predictions. First, it is shown how dual classification is integrated with Bayesian inference. Later, we introduce a surrogate deep learning module to transform the raw uncertainty output into an easily interpretable prediction uncertainty index (PUI). The PUI metric can be used to alarm a decision-maker of the potential mistakes. The proposed dual Bayesian models are investigated on a 2D structure with seven different sensor layouts. Our approach yields increased robustness for different metrics compared with the benchmark. In addition to the performance boost, PUI information paves the way for a risk-informed implementation of deep learning models in vibration-based damage diagnosis.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 4386}

This study uses the One Health wholistic framework for examining bovine tuberculosis (TB) and its relationship to human health. This approach can help bridge surveillance data gaps and contribute to disease control and prevention programs for dairy farm workers, cattle, and the environment. The primary objective of this study was to compare the self-reported history of TB among dairy workers in Bailey County, Texas, with occupational categories of risk and exposure to TB. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among dairy workers. Job positions were used as a proxy for exposure to cattle-high and medium/low. We employed bivariate analyses to examine differences between groups using both the chi-square test and the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test. Results: Of the 293 dairy workers invited, 77.0% (n = 225) participated. No statistically significant associations were found between job categories and reported history of TB exposure. Workers in the high group were younger, Guatemalan males with lower levels of formal education, more likely to be single with no children, and cohabitating with coworkers compared with the medium/low group. Conclusion/Application to Practice: Self-reported TB history among dairy workers is an imprecise measure of being previously diagnosed with TB. Dairy workers at risk for occupationally acquired TB could be tested for TB before employment and tested periodically thereafter, and more expeditiously treated if a positive test is obtained. Future studies should focus on the feasibility of offering on-farm health services, such as TB screening.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 4390}

Here, we characterized and quantified gene turnover for the epidemic lineage of a bacterial plant pathogen of major agricultural importance worldwide. Relying on a dense geographic sampling spanning 39 years of evolution, we estimated both the dynamics of single nucleotide polymorphism accumulation and gene content turnover. We identified extensive gene content variation among lineages even at the smallest phylogenetic and geographic scales. Gene turnover rate exceeded nucleotide substitution rate by three orders of magnitude. Accessory genes were found preferentially located on plasmids, but we identified a highly plastic chromosomal region hosting ecologically important genes such as transcription activator-like effectors.

Calcined eggshell particulate (CEP) was obtained from chicken eggshell while treated sisal fibers (TSF) were obtained from the Agave sisalana plant. Both processed reinforcements were incorporated into an epoxy matrix using the hand lay-up method for the development of the bio-composites. Thermal, water absorption and mechanical behavior tests were carried out on the developed composites and the control sample. Analysis of the results showed that the presence of the bio-fillers in the epoxy matrix enhances the insulating, resistance to water uptake, and mechanical properties of the composites compared to the unreinforced epoxy matrix.

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Rock glaciers and transitional ice-debris complexes predominate the Central Andean landform assemblage, yet regional studies on their state of activity and their kinematics remain sparse. Here we utilize the national glacier inventory of Argentina to quantify surface velocity fields of 244 rock glaciers and 51 ice-debris complexes, located in the Cordon del Plata range, Argentina. Applying a feature-tracking approach to repeated RapidEye satellite imagery acquired between 2010 and 2017/18, we find mean displacement rates between 0.37 and 2.61 m year(-1) for 149 landforms, while for the remaining 146 features, surface movement remains below our level of detection. We compare our satellite-derived velocity fields with ground-truth data from two local field sites and find closely matching results in magnitude and spatial distribution. With average displacement of one-third of the active rock glaciers and ice-debris complexes exceeding 1 m year(-1), the region hosts an exceptional number of fast-flowing periglacial landforms, compared to other mountain belts. Using a random forest model, we test the predictive power of 25 morphometric and topoclimatic candidate predictors for modelling the state of activity of rock glaciers and ice-debris complexes on two different scales. For entire landforms and individual landform segments, constructed along displacement centrelines, we can predict the state of activity with overall accuracies of 70.08% (mean AUROC = 0.785) and 74.86% (mean AUROC = 0.753), respectively. While topoclimatic parameters such as solar radiation and elevation are most important for entire landforms, geometric parameters become more important at the scale of landform segments. Despite tentative correlations between local slope and surface kinematics, our results point to factors integrating slope and distance to the source to govern local deformation. We conclude that feature tracking in optical imagery is feasible for regional studies in remote regions and provides valuable insight into the current state of the Andean cryosphere.

Many of these factors interact nonlinearly to yield synergistic benefits and curative outcomes. We argue that these synergies and nonlinear feedbacks must be leveraged to improve the study of pathogenesis in situ and to develop more effective therapies.

The structure and performance of copolymer LNS-1 was assessed via gel permeation chromatography, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance hydrogen spectrum, Thermogravimetric analysis, and scanning electron microscopy analysis. To study the effect of the retarder on cement slurry properties, the performance of the slurry with LNS-1 was tested. The experimental results demonstrate that LNS-1 was successfully synthesized with excellent retarding ability, thermal resistance, and outstanding suspension; thus, the copolymer can serve as an excellent retarder for oil well cement. Through exploration, it is found that the mechanism of the retarder mainly includes adsorption - membrane layer mechanism and chelation - covering mechanism. NVCL exhibits good complexation, adsorption, hydrolysis stability, and thermal stability. It contains three lone pairs of electrons, which allow the NVCL to chelate Ca2+ that in the liquid phase of the cement.

A few studies have assessed the impact of tweets-derived ambient population on crime and the spillover effect of such impact at different spatial and temporal scales. However, none has revealed the intraday variation of such spillover effect. This study analyzes both the direct and spillover effects of tweets-derived ambient population on crime and its intraday difference in day and night during weekdays and weekends. Four crime types, including assault, burglary, robbery, and theft, are examined at the neighborhood level. The analysis is based on negative binomial regression models, with the control of necessary socioeconomic and land-use variables driven by criminology theories. Results show (1) tweets-derived ambient population affects the magnitude of crime, but this effect varies by types of crime at different time periods of the day and week, and (2) the spillover effect of the tweets-derived ambient population exists for all four types of crime during most of the time periods at the neighborhood level and is particularly pronounced for thefts at all time periods.

We use finite element simulations for calculating the surface profile and the corresponding charge density in the vicinity of the tip. Typical electric fields E are in the range of a few kV/cm, the maximum equilibrium surface deformations have a height on the order of (but somewhat smaller than) the capillary length of liquid He-4 (0.5 mm), and the maximum number density of elementary charges in a hillock or dimple, limited by an electrohydrodynamic instability, is some 10(13) m(-2). These results can be used to determine the charge density at a liquid helium surface from the measured surface profile.

DHX37 expression was examined via the Oncomine database and Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER). We explored the prognostic role of DHX37 in cancers across various databases. Coexpression genes, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and fundamental regulators were performed via LinkedOmics. Confirming the prognostic value of DHX37 in liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), we explored the role of DHX37 in infiltrated lymphocytes in cancers using the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) and TIMER databases. Results. Through GO and KEGG analyses, expression of DHX37 was also correlated with complex function-specific networks involving the ribosome and RNA metabolic signaling pathways. In LIHC and LUAD, DHX37 expression showed significant positive correlations with markers of T-regs, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and T cell exhaustion, contributing to immune tolerance. Conclusion. These results indicate that DHX37 can serve as a prognostic biomarker in LIHC and LUAD while having an important role in immune tolerance by activating the function of T-regs, MDSC, and T cell exhaustion.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 4457}

This paper reports on midwifery knowledge of Aboriginal women's cultural needs, their perceptions of health systems issues, and their ability to provide equitable and culturally safe care. Method A qualitative study framed by an Indigenous methodology and methods which supported inductive, multilayered analyses and consensus-driven interpretations for two clinical midwife data groups (n = 61) drawn from a larger project data set (n = 145) comprising Aboriginal women and midwives. Findings Midwives demonstrated limited knowledge of Aboriginal women's cultural childbearing requirements, reported inadequate access to cultural education, substituted references to women-centered care in the absence of culturally relevant knowledge and consistently expressed racialized assumptions. Factors identified by midwives as likely to influence the midwifery workforce enabling them to provide culturally safe care for Aboriginal women included more professional development focused on improving understandings of cultural birth practices and health system changes which create safer maternal health care environments for Aboriginal women. Conclusions Individual, workforce, and health systems issues impact midwives' capability to meet Aboriginal women's cultural needs.

However, the physicochemical properties of DMY related to its bioavailability, especially its stability, are unclear. RESULTS The effects of pH, temperature, metal ions and ascorbic acid (AA) on the stability of DMY were studied using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The bioavailability of DMY in the presence and absence of AA was compared. Dihydromyricetin was unstable in weak alkaline solutions, and the degradation was significantly accelerated in the presence of Cu2+ and Fe3+. The degradation process followed the first-order kinetic model. The degradation rate constant (k) increased with increasing pH and temperature. The remaining DMY was only 49% of its initial concnentration after 4 h in simulated intestinal fluid (SIF) at 37 degrees C. However, by supplementing with AA, the degradation of DMY was rarely occured within 6 h. The solubility of DMY at pH 3-5 was about 750 mu g mL(-1), slightly increasing to 853 mu g mL(-1) at pH 6. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the bioavailability of DMY increased from 0.122% to 0.341% by supplementing with AA (10% of DMY). CONCLUSION The degradation of DMY is one reason for its poor bioavailability. The presence of AA could significantly improve the stability of DMY, and further improve its bioavailability in rats.

The keywords were Blastocystis and one of the following ones: STs, subtypes, distribution, epidemiology, prevalence, infection, molecular, geographic, intestinal parasites, genetic diversity and characterization. Results In recent years, various molecular epidemiological studies have been carried out in some provinces/regions of China to identify subtypes of Blastocystis. Infants and young children, school students, hospitalized diarrhea patients, HIV/AIDS patients, tuberculosis patients, and cancer patients as respondents had been included.

{"label": "NEG", "text": "In this article, a novel configuration of ring dielectric resonator-based multiple input multiple output antenna (MIMO) is proposed with a beam tilting characteristic. To achieve the beam tilting and low correlation among the far-field patterns, the conducting plate is positioned in between the antenna elements. Dual resonating frequencies are obtained by exciting the ring DRA electromagnetically with a microstrip line via optimized double-ring loaded slots. All the ports are arranged in a parallel fashion. Port-1/port-2 is placed 180(0) out of phase with port-3/port-4. The proposed antenna achieves the maximum beam tilting of 55(0) and 35(0) at 2.61 and 2.95 GHz, respectively. Polarization diversity is confirmed between oppositely oriented ports i.e. port-1/port-2 and port-4/port-3 by getting LHCP and RHCP patterns, respectively. The optimum value of diversity parameters of the proposed MIMO ring DRA makes it suitable for high-speed applications.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 4493}

The aim of this study was to examine a new community-based, clinical mental health service for young people (12 -25 years) with co-occurring ID and mental illness, and to explore the outcomes for young people and experiences of families who received service from the new program. Methods : Two studies were conducted using qualitative and quantitative research methods. First, using the Health of the Nations Outcome Scales (HoNOS), a quantitative longitudinal study was conducted to measure any changes in young people's behavioral and social issues, mental health, and levels of impairment, from the being accepted to the service till the completion of care (n = 23). A second study involved qualitative interviews with parents/carers who attended the service (n = 10) that were analyzed to look for emerging themes in parents'/carers' experience of the service. Results : Results of study 1 indicated that young people's behavioral issues and social problems decreased from the time of admission to their completion of carer. Further, results of Study 2 revealed that parents/carers considered the mental health and behavior of their child had improved from being in the program. Parents also valued the person-centered, multidisciplinary, co-ordinated approach of the service, and viewed the new program as an improvement on previous services they had experienced. Conclusions : This study provides preliminary support for the efficacy of the new program and suggests future specialist dual disability services may look to a family-focused, multidisciplinary approach that includes assessment, treatment, and management as an effective treatment model.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 4505}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Quantitative genetics has evolved dramatically in the past century, and the proliferation of genetic data, in quantity as well as type, enables the characterization of complex interactions and mechanisms beyond the scope of its theoretical foundations. In this article, we argue that revisiting the framework for analysis is important and we begin to lay the foundations of an alternative formulation of quantitative genetics based on information theory. Information theory can provide sensitive and unbiased measures of statistical dependencies among variables, and it provides a natural mathematical language for an alternative view of quantitative genetics. In the previous work, we examined the information content of discrete functions and applied this approach and methods to the analysis of genetic data. In this article, we present a framework built around a set of relationships that both unifies the information measures for the discrete functions and uses them to express key quantitative genetic relationships. Information theory measures of variable interdependency are used to identify significant interactions, and a general approach is described for inferring functional relationships in genotype and phenotype data. We present information-based measures of the genetic quantities: penetrance, heritability, and degrees of statistical epistasis. Our scope here includes the consideration of both two- and three-variable dependencies and independently segregating variants, which captures additive effects, genetic interactions, and two-phenotype pleiotropy. This formalism and the theoretical approach naturally apply to higher multivariable interactions and complex dependencies, and can be adapted to account for population structure, linkage, and nonrandomly segregating markers.

A sample of 1,083 (773 males, 310 females) correctional officers from two different U.S. state correctional systems (Massachusetts, Texas) served as participants in this study. As predicted, weak staff support was a significantly stronger correlate of correctional officer stress than inmate-related stressors, after controlling for age, sex, race, research site, years of experience, institutional security level, degree of contact with inmates, and non-work sources of stress.

The demographic, clinical, and perioperative characteristics, as well as data on follow-up and complications, were analyzed. Results: Of the 155 patients treated for TT, 15 were included in this study. The average age of the patients was 10.3 years (range: 3.2-13.3 years). All patients experienced a direct scrotal trauma and subsequently presented with an ipsilateral scrotal or testicular pain secondary to the twisted testicle. Six patients were misdiagnosed as having scrotal inflammation or hematoma, and all were initially treated at local hospitals. The mean duration of symptoms before hospitalization was 138 h (range: 5-504 h). The mean degree of torsion was 390 degrees (range: 180-720 degrees). The testicular salvation rate, at 33%, was poor.

To report on an improved botulinum toxin injection with conjunctival microincision for beginners, and to determine the effectiveness of botulinum toxin A (BTXA) in the treatment of patients with acute acquired comitant esotropia (AACE). Methods. Medical records of 29 AACE patients were retrospectively analyzed. BTXA was injected into the unilateral or bilateral medial rectus muscle with conjunctival microincision without electromyographic guidance. Success was defined as total horizontal deviation <= 10 prism diopters (PD) and evidence of binocular vision. Results. Twenty-nine patients were included, of whom 22 were male and 7 were female. The mean age at onset was 14.2 +/- 7.4 (range, 4-34) years. The mean time from onset of AACE to injection was 18.4 +/- 20.3 (range, 1-96) weeks. All patients completed at least 6 months of follow-up, and the mean follow-up after BTXA injection was 12.3 +/- 4.8 months (range, 7-24 months). Neurological evaluation and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were unremarkable in all patients. The mean spherical equivalent refraction was -1.22 +/- 2.85D and - 0.97 +/- 2.80D in the right and left eyes, respectively. Mean preinjective esotropia was 38.4 +/- 18.9 PD (range, +10-+80 PD) at near and 40.2 +/- 17.7 PD (range, +20-+80 PD) at far distance. The mean angle of deviation at 6 months after injection was 0.6 +/- 4.1 PD (range, -3-+15 PD) at near and 3.0 +/- 5.9 PD (range, 0-+20 PD) at far distance. There was significant difference in the angle of deviation at near and far fixation between pre-BTXA and post-BTXA 6 months (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, resp.). There was no significant difference in the angle of deviation at near and far fixation between post-BTXA 6 months and post-BTXA at final follow-up (p = 0.259 and 0.326, resp.). Mean stereoacuity improved from 338 to 88 arc seconds. During the follow-up period, 5 of 29 patients had recurrent esotropia. Two patients refused all further treatment, and the other 3 patients required incisional strabismus surgery. The success rates were 86.2% (25/29) at 6 months and 82.8% (24/29) at final follow-up.

Design/methodology/approach Data were collected using an online survey method, and structural equation modeling was employed to test the research hypotheses with a sample of 826 Chinese respondents. Findings The results demonstrate that utilitarian environmental benefits directly enhance green brand image. Both utilitarian environmental benefits and nature connectedness indirectly influence green brand image through GPV and brand innovativeness. Subsequently, green brand innovativeness positively affects GPV. The moderating effects of brand type on the relationships in the model are also established. Practical implications Organisations should enhance green value and brand innovativeness when adopting green brand positioning tools to strengthen green brand image and implement diverse green branding strategies between brands of physical goods and services. Originality/value Although previous studies have investigated how perceived benefits affect the development of brand image, the issue has not been examined based on the human associative memory framework from a green branding perspective.

The purpose of this report is to describe a case series of patients with COVID-19 and ARDS in which ETT occlusion resulted in significant clinical consequences and to define the pathology of the obstructing material. Methods: Incidents of ETT occlusion during mechanical ventilation of COVID-19 patients were reported by clinicians and retrospective chart review was conducted. Statistical analysis was performed comparing event rates between COVID-19 and non-COVID 19 patients on mechanical ventilation over the predefined period. Specimens were collected and submitted for pathological examination. Findings: Eleven COVID-19 patients experienced endotracheal tube occlusion over a period of 2 months. Average age was 69 (14.3, range 33-85) years. Mean APACHE III score was 73.6 (17.3). All patients had AKI and cytokine storm. Nine exhibited biomarkers for hypercoagulability. Average days on mechanical ventilation before intervention for ETT occlusion was 14 (5.18) days (range of 9 to 23 days). Five patients were discharged from the ICU, and 4 expired. Average documented airway resistance on admission was 14.2 (3.0) cm H2O/L/sec. Airway resistance before tube exchange was 28.1 (8.0) cm H2O /L/sec. No similar events of endotracheal tube occlusion were identified in non-COVID patients on mechanical ventilation during the same time period. Microscopically, the material consisted of mucin admixed with necrotic cell debris, variable numbers of degenerated inflammatory cells, oral contaminants and red blood cells. Interpretation: Patients with COVID-19 and ARDS on prolonged mechanical ventilation are at risk for developing ETT obstruction due to deposition of a thick, tenacious material within the tube that consists primarily of mucin and cellular debris.

Though circadian dysfunction has been considered among the multiple causes of obesity, little work has been done to explore the relationship between obesity, circadian dysfunction, and sexual dimorphism. The Neotomodon alstoni mouse is a suitable model for such research. This study employed N. alstoni mice in a chronobiological analysis to determine whether there is circadian desynchronization of relative PER1 and BMAL1 protein levels in the hypothalamus, liver, visceral white adipose tissue, kidney, and heart. It also compared differences between sexes and lean and obese N. alstoni adult mice, by recording behavior and daily circulating serum melatonin as markers of circadian output. We found that obese mice display reduced locomotor activity. Additionally, Cosinor analyses of the relative expression of PER1 and BMAL1 show differences between lean and obese mice in a sex-linked manner. The PER1 24 h rhythm was absent in all tissues of obese males and significant in the tissues of obese females. The BMAL1 24 h rhythm also was significant in most of the tissues tested in lean males, whereas it was significant and shifted the acrophase (peak time of rhythm) in most of the tissues in obese females. Both lean male and female mice showed a rhythmic 24 h pattern of circulating serum melatonin. This daily profile was not only absent in obese mice of both sexes but showed sexual dimorphism. Obese male mice showed lower circulating levels of melatonin compared to lean male mice, but they were higher in obese females compared to lean females. Our results suggest that obesity in N. alstoni is associated with an internal circadian desynchronization in a sex-dependent manner. Overall, this study reinforces the need for further research on the neuroendocrinology of obesity and circadian rhythms using this biological model.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 4579}

However, its detection requires extremely sensitive and efficient technologies. A powerful molecular tool based on the principle of 'divide and conquer' has emerged to solve this problem. Thus, digital PCR (dPCR) allows absolute and accurate quantification of target molecules. Areas covered: In this review we will discuss the fundamentals of dPCR and the most common approaches used for partition of samples and quantification. The advantages and limitations of dPCR will be mentioned in the context of LB in oncology. Expert opinion: In our opinion, dPCR has proven to be one of the most sensitive methods available for LB analysis, albeit some aspects such as its capacity of multiplexing and protocol standardization still require further improvements. Furthermore, the increasing sensitivities and lower costs of next generation sequencing (NGS) methods position dPCR as a confirmatory and complementary technique for NGS results which will likely prove to be very useful for treatment monitoring and assessing minimal residual disease.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 4602}

One way to tackle this problem is to use guided navigation, in which other autonomous agents, endowed with perception, can combine their distinct viewpoints to infer the localization and the appropriate commands to guide a sensory deprived agent through a particular path. Due to the limited knowledge about the physical and perceptual characteristics of the guided agent, this task should be conducted on a level of abstraction allowing the use of a generic motion model, and high-level commands, that can be applied by any type of autonomous agents, including humans. The main task considered in this work is, given a group of autonomous agents perceiving their common environment with their independent, egocentric and local vision sensors, the development and evaluation of algorithms capable of producing a set of high-level commands (involving qualitative directions: e.g. move left, go straight ahead) capable of guiding a sensory deprived robot to a goal location. In order to accomplish this, the present paper assumes relations from the qualitative spatial reasoning formalism called StarVars, whose inference method is also used to build a model of the domain. This paper presents two qualitative-probabilistic algorithms for guided navigation using a particle filter and qualitative spatial relations. In the first algorithm, the particle filter is run upon a qualitative representation of the domain, whereas the second algorithm transforms the numerical output of a standard particle filter into qualitative relations to guide a sensory deprived robot. The proposed methods were evaluated with experiments carried out on a 2D humanoid robot simulator. A proof of concept executing the algorithms on a group of real humanoid robots is also presented. The results obtained demonstrate the success of the guided navigation models proposed in this work.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 4607}

This article shows how the Basque sovereigntist unions ELA (Euskal Langileen Alkartasuna) and LAB (Langile Abertzaleen Batzordeak) have formed a 'counterpower' bloc, in opposition to CCOO (Comisiones Obreras) and UGT (Union General de Trabajadores) that are more prone to engage into social dialogue. The formers' renewal strategy based on organizing workers 'deeply' - especially with ELA's recurrent use of a strike-fund that fosters membership participation and affiliation through confederal solidarity - has altered union politics in the Basque Country. This has produced very high strike rates since the 2000s, perhaps the highest in Europe, and a 'spill over' effect that polarizes union alliances substantially. The article brings out the question of how unions could possibly locate industrial conflict within their renewal strategies and transform their organizations accordingly. Methodologically, the article contributes to the literature on strikes by underlining the importance of studying strikes critically, as a conscious collective process, in order to understand that their uneven development also derives from concrete unions' strategies.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 4611}

A study was conducted on a long-term fire research trial in the semi-arid part of Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. The study aimed at determining the impact of outbreak on the soil properties by comparing the effect of different prescribed fire frequencies on pH, C, N, P, Ca, Mg, Cu, Zn, Mn, Na levels and C:N ratios. The treatments were no burn (control), sexennial, quadrennial, triennial, biennial and annual burns randomly laid in uniform blocks. A line intercept sampling technique was used in soil sampling from 0 to 75 mm depth for analysis. Fire burning frequencies had significantly varied effects on soil chemical properties (P < 0.05). There was an increase of C, Mg and Ca in the triennial than other frequency treatments. Significant positive correlations were observed between N and P, Ca and Mg and pH and Ca and Mg content and burning frequencies. C and other elements content were reduced in most burning frequencies except triennial. The triennial burning frequency may be an ideal option for veld management.

Methods: Twenty ALS subjects were randomized to placebo and mexiletine 300 or 600 mg daily for 4 wk and assessed by transcranial magnetic stimulation and axonal excitability studies. The primary endpoint was change in resting motor threshold (RMT). Results: RMT was unchanged with 4 wk of mexiletine (combined active therapies) as compared to placebo, which showed a significant increase (P = .039). Reductions of motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude (P = .013) and accommodation half-time (P = .002), secondary outcome measures of cortical and axonal excitability, respectively, were also evident at 4 wk on mexiletine. Conclusions: The relative stabilization of RMT in the treated subjects was unexpected and could be attributed to unaccounted sources of error or chance. However, a possible alternative cause is neuromodulation preventing an increase.

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Blended learning is the fastest growing teaching modality in North America and much of the world. However, research and training in blended learning are far outpaced by its usage. To remedy this gap, we developed a competency framework and Blended Teaching Readiness Instrument (BTRI) to help teachers and researchers evaluate teacher readiness for blended environments. The purpose of this research is to show that the blended teaching readiness model and accompanying BTRI are reliable for use with teacher candidates both before and after going through a blended teaching course. This knowledge would allow researchers and practitioners to have greater confidence in using the BTRI for future growth curve modeling for the identified blended teaching competencies. To accomplish this, we collected pre- and post-data from teacher candidates across multiple semesters who were studying in a blended teaching course. Using confirmatory factor analysis, we determined the pre-class survey results fell within the range of the four fit statistics cutoffs (RMSEA = 0.045, CFI = 0.933, TLI = 0.929 and SRMR = 0.043). And, the post-class survey results had good fit as well (RMSEA = 0.044, CFI = 0.911, TLI = 0.905 and SRMR = 0.051). We also showed that the factor loadings and communalities were statistically significant. By testing the factors in this way, we make a case for the survey to be a valid and reliable instrument in assessing blended teacher competency. Additionally, we tested the model for measurement invariance and found that we could reliably use the BTRI for pre-post growth modeling. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic? Blended learning is the fastest growing teaching modality in Canada and the United States, and is expanding rapidly throughout the rest of the world. Teaching in blended learning settings requires distinct skills and dispositions specific to the modality. A blended-teaching-focused competency framework is a necessary element in any blended teacher preparation program. Though there have been attempts to make a blended teaching framework before, none of these exclusively focus on the distinct skills of blended teaching nor have they been validated. What this paper adds? Describes our free, publicly accessible competency framework that focuses exclusively on blended teaching Validates a concise Blended Teaching Readiness Instrument (BTRI) to go along with the framework. Confirms pre-post measurement invariance for the BTRI which allows for use with pre-post growth modeling. Implications for practice and policy The competency framework and validation are a theoretical contribution to the rapidly expanding field of blended learning research. With the valid BTRI instrument and framework, teachers can get feedback on their strengths and weaknesses in blended teaching and learn how to improve and help others.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 4675}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Background Retigabine belongs to the novel generation of antiepileptic drugs but its complex mechanism of action causes that the drug might be effective in other diseases, for instance, alcohol dependence. It is known that ethanol abuse impaired the function of brain structures associated with memory and learning such as the hippocampus. In our previous study, retigabine reduced hippocampal changes induced by ethanol in the EEG rhythms in rabbits. This study is focused on the impact of retigabine on memory processes in male rats receiving alcohol. Methods Memory was evaluated in various experimental models: Morris water maze, Contextual, and Cued Fear Conditioning tests. Retigabine was administered for 3 weeks directly to the stomach via oral gavage at a dose of 10 mg/kg. Rats received also 20% ethanol (5 g/kg/day in two doses) via oral gavage for 3 weeks and had free access to 5% ethanol in the afternoon and at night. Morris water maze was performed after 1 and 3 weeks of ethanol administration and after 1 week from the discontinuation of ethanol administration. Contextual and Cued Fear Conditioning tests were carried out after 24 h and 72 h of alcohol discontinuation. Results The drug significantly decreased ethanol-induced memory disturbances during alcohol administration as well as slightly improved learning processes after the discontinuation of ethanol administration. Conclusions This beneficial effect of retigabine-ethanol interaction on memory may be a relevant element of the drug's impact on the development of addiction.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 4697}
{"label": "NEG", "text": "Aqueous solutions of poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) of various concentrations (20, 25, and 28 wt%) were successfully spun into fibers by centrifugal spinning. The pristine PVP fibers were annealed and carbonized to produce flexible carbon fibers for use as binder-free anodes in lithium-ion batteries. These flexible carbon fibers were prepared by developing a novel three-step heat treatment to reduce the residual stresses in the pristine PVP precursor fibers, and to prevent fiber degradation during carbonization. The thermogravimetric analysis data showed that the annealed fibers yielded a residual mass percentage of 36.0% while the pristine PVP fibers suffered a higher mass loss and only retained 26.5% of original mass above 450 degrees C (under nitrogen). The electrochemical performance of the carbon-fiber anodes was evaluated by conducting galvanostatic charge/discharge, rate performance, and cycle voltammetry experiments. The 20, 25, and 28 wt% derived binder-free anodes delivered specific charge capacities of 205, 189, and 275 mAh g(-1), respectively, after the first cycle at a current density of 100 mA g(-1).

Unfortunately, the nature of this interaction is unclear; we suggest a framework to conceptualize the interaction and test it vis-a-vis the interpersonal circumplex framework. Method Participants (N = 598; M-age = 38.39; 327 females; 72.1% White) reported their levels of grandiose narcissism and self-esteem and completed interpersonal circumplex measures of efficacies, values, problems, and sensitivities. Results As self-esteem decreased, grandiose narcissism related (a) more negatively to communal efficacies and values and (b) more positively to sensitivity to others' communal behaviors. Also as self-esteem decreased, unexpectedly, grandiose narcissism related (a) more positively to agentic efficacies and problems and (b) more negatively to sensitivity to others' agentic behaviors. Conclusion Overall, the present findings generally support using interaction models over additive models of grandiose narcissism and self-esteem in interpersonal contexts, suggesting that grandiose narcissism becomes generally less communal, more agentic, and more interpersonally problematic as self-esteem decreases.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 4703}

Managers can use findings in this study to learn how to plan and manage organizational change in the fast-paced business environment of digital service industries. Social implications This research will help to understand work attitudes, emotions and behaviors and therefore will improve the well-being in the organizations experiencing transformation. Originality/value Individual readiness as a stand-alone concept was not enough explored in the literature, thus creating an opportunity for this study to fill the research gap. The lessons learned from this study are the following: ongoing change initiatives require longer time with a need to extend the organizational restructuring to behavioral and mindset change. This research suggests a practical approach to the assessment of change readiness in organizations. A simple model explaining factors affecting employees' willingness and ability to change has been suggested.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 4727}
{"label": "NEG", "text": "Background. Literature indicated some risk factors for low back pain; however, there is insufficient knowledge on the effect of caring-related physical activities and individual characteristics on Chronic Low Back Pain (CLBP) in mothers of children with Cerebral Palsy (CP). Objective. The main aim of the current study was to determine the association between caring-related physical activities, Body Mass Index (BMI), education level, and CLBP in mothers of children with CP. Design. Case-control observational study. Setting. Pediatric rehabilitation clinics. Participants. Mothers of children with CP. Main Outcome Measures. Measures is comprised of a self-administered questionnaire that included the demographic characteristics items, pain visual analog scale, and three items of the job-related physical demands questionnaire. The logistic regression model served to assess the association. Results. The control group included 81 healthy mothers, with a mean (SD) age of 39 (8.45) years, and the case group contained 90 mothers who suffered from CLBP, with a mean (SD) age of 37 (8.64) years. Performing lifting movements (OR 13.73, beta=2.62, p<.001), BMI (OR 11.85, beta=2.47, p=.011), repetitive bending (OR 7.67, beta=2.04, p=.010), forward-flexion (OR 6.71, beta=1.91, p=.033), and level of education (OR .21, beta=-1.53, p=.020), in descending order of odds ratios, were found to be significant predictors of the CLBP in mothers of children with CP. Conclusion. Avoiding caring-related harmful physical activities, maintaining body weight within a healthy range, and increasing knowledge for accurate lifting/handling techniques can be helpful to prevent the CLBP in mothers of children with CP.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 4728}
{"label": "NEG", "text": "During foraging, organisms need to assess the costs and benefits related to resources wanted. An energy-efficient way of locating and deciding among new food sources is to use cues left by other organisms in the environment (i.e., social information). In the present study, manipulative bioassays were conducted to evaluate the role of intra- and interspecific chemical cues in the selection of food resource by Nasutitermes corniger (Termitidae: Nasutitermitinae). For this, we tested the hypothesis that individuals of N. corniger are able to perceive and use chemical cues by either colonies of the same species or from different species. Linear trail bioassays were conducted to verify whether N. corniger workers perceive and accept intra- and interspecific chemical cues. Then, resource bioassays were performed with a binary and multiple choices to evaluate whether the termite group's decision of food resources was based on intra- and/or interspecific chemical cues. In general, groups of N. corniger preferred baits with chemical cues of other intraspecific colonies or with undetectable cues (hexane solvent or interspecific cues) than those with their own chemical signals. These results suggest that intraspecific chemical cues seem to modulate the food resource selection in N. corniger, which may help researchers to better understand the use of habitat by termites.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 4729}

In addition to anthropogenic disturbance to this coastal region, hurricanes are an additional and natural perturbation to the ecosystem. The data presented here explore the status of populations of this species spanning the entire known range and the factors influencing population demography including anthropogenic disturbance and severe tropical storms. Using microsatellite markers, we were able to document the genetic structure of A. sanctaerosae, including current and historic patterns of migration. These results combined with ecological and census data reveal the characteristics that have influenced population persistence: ecological variables affecting the recovery of the population clusters after severe tropical storms, genetic fragmentation due to anthropogenic disturbance, and their interaction. These findings demonstrate the significance that the high traffic beach communities of the NGC and their impact on the once intact contiguous dune ecosystem have on recovery after severe tropical storms. Contemporary modeling methods that compare current and historic levels of gene flow suggest A. sanctaerosae has experienced a single, contiguous population subdivision, and the isolates reduced in size since the onset of commercial development of the NGC.

The aim of this study was to assess the occurrence of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), Salmonella, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in animal faeces from six animal petting zoos and one farm fair in Switzerland. Furthermore, hygiene facilities on the venues were evaluated. Of 163 faecal samples, 75 contained stx1, stx2 or stx1/stx2 genes, indicating the presence of STEC. Samples included faeces from sika deer (100%), sheep (92%), goats (88%), mouflons (80%), camels (62%), llamas (50%), yaks (50%), pigs (29%) and donkeys (6%), whereas no stx genes were isolated from faeces of calves, guinea pigs, hens, ostriches, ponies, zebras or zebus. Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Stourbridge (S. Stourbridge) was detected in faecal samples from camels. A total of four ESBL-producing E. coli strains were isolated from faeces of goats, camels and pigs. PCR and sequencing identified the presence of bla(CTX-M-15) in three and bla(CTX-M-65) in one E. coli. Antimicrobial resistance profiling using the disk diffusion method revealed two multidrug-resistant (MDR) E. coli with resistance to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin and azithromycin, all of which are critically important drugs for human medicine. Multilocus sequence typing identified E. coli ST162, E. coli ST2179, extraintestinal high-risk E. coli ST410 and E. coli ST4553, which belongs to the emerging extraintestinal clonal complex (CC) 648. No MRSA was detected. On all animal petting venues, there were inadequacies with regard to access to hygiene information and handwashing hygiene facilities.

It addresses the following six thematic aspects: relevance, different forms of accommodation sharing, users, hosts, platforms, and finally, industry regulation. Design/methodology/approach This study identifies the most likely holistic future scenario by conducting a two-stage Delphi study involving 59 expert panelists. It addresses 33 projections for six thematic sections of the accommodation sharing industry: relevance, different forms of accommodation sharing, users, hosts, platforms, and finally, industry regulation. Findings The results indicate that the number of shared accommodations and users of home-sharing will increase. Moreover, the cost advantage is the predominant driver for users to engage in the accommodation sharing segment, and for the hosts, the generation of an extra income is the primary incentive. Finally, the regulation within this industry is expected to be more effective in the foreseeable future. Practical implications The results are critical, not only to advance our theoretical understanding and stimulate critical discussions on the long-term development of accommodation sharing but also to assist governments and policymakers who have an interest in developing and regulating this sector and developers seeking business opportunities. Originality/value While there is ample knowledge about the past and current development of accommodation sharing in tourism, little is understood about its potential future development and implications for consumers, the economy, and society. To date, no scientific research is available that develops scenarios about the future of accommodation sharing.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 4774}
{"label": "NEG", "text": "Lampreys are extant members of the agnathan (jawless) vertebrates that diverged similar to 500 million years ago, during a critical stage of vertebrate evolution when image-forming eyes first emerged. Among lamprey species assessed thus far, the retina of the southern hemisphere pouched lamprey, Geotria australis, is unique, in that it possesses morphologically distinct photoreceptors and expresses five visual photopigments. This study focused on determining the number of different photoreceptors present in the retina of G. australis and whether each cell type expresses a single opsin class. Five photoreceptor subtypes were identified based on ultrastructure and differential expression of one of each of the five different visual opsin classes (lws, sws1, sws2, rh1, and rh2) known to be expressed in the retina. This suggests, therefore, that the retina of G. australis possesses five spectrally and morphologically distinct photoreceptors, with the potential for complex color vision. Each photoreceptor subtype was shown to have a specific spatial distribution in the retina, which is potentially associated with changes in spectral radiance across different lines of sight. These results suggest that there have been strong selection pressures for G. australis to maintain broad spectral sensitivity for the brightly lit surface waters that this species inhabits during its marine phase. These findings provide important insights into the functional anatomy of the early vertebrate retina and the selection pressures that may have led to the evolution of complex color vision.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 4775}

Yet, a paucity of research exists to consider 'how' both mentors and mentees come to understand their respective role(s). Attempting to redress this gap in research, the aim of this project was to examine the developmental experiences of mentors (and mentees) while participating in a mentoring programme within a University undergraduate sport coaching module. In doing so, this study specifically attended to the critical experiences of mentors and mentees in order to determine how, over the course of the module, mentors and mentees were able to operationalise their role within the coaching context. Data were collected through a series of focus group interviews with 10 mentors and 12 mentees, which were repeated over multiple time-points throughout the mentoring programme. The data were subject to a reflexive thematic analysis to yield three interrelated themes; initiating meaningful mentoring; the relationality of mentoring; and finally, putting 'mentoring' to work. The findings demonstrated the ability (and inability) of learners to develop the reflexive awareness required to negotiate and align their identities within the pedagogical context under study. Drawing upon the explanatory work of Goffman and Crossley, the study contributes to the deconstruction of mentoring practice more specifically, and the wider understanding of complexity of socialisation in coaching and education more generally.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 4777}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Introduction: The aim of this study was to gather information on the prevalence and risk factors for scar pain and sensibility disorders after breast cancer surgery, as only limited information of these complaints are available. Material and Methods: A clinical cohort study using a non-validated questionnaire was conducted among women who presented to routine follow-up at the Breast Cancer Center Rostock, Germany. The subjects were informed that the subjective perception and sensation were in the foreground and that the questionnaire had to be filled out independently according to the current feeling. Results: Overall 175 patients could be evaluated. The prevalence of scar pain was 30.8% after breast conserving therapy (BCT) and 34.5% after mastectomy. Following BCT 87.5%, respectively 81.8% of women after mastectomy were very satisfied or satisfied with the scarring. Sensory disorders were increased in the mastectomy group (p = 0.001). Scar pain after previous surgery was a risk factor to develop sensory disorders after BCT (p = 0.008) and mastectomy (p = 0.029). For patients receiving mastectomy, sensory disorders after previous breast surgeries increased the risk for sensory disorders (p = 0.029). Smoking was a risk factor for sensory disorders after mastectomy (p = 0.048). Multivariate analysis could not confirm any of the risk factors. Conclusion: This study demonstrated a high satisfaction with scarring after breast surgery and a low level of scar pain. A lack of postoperative information, as well as a low level of actually performed scar care after surgery were observed. Increased focus should be on improved information on postoperative scare care.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 4786}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Ion exchange chromatography is a powerful and ubiquitous unit operation in the purification of therapeutic proteins. However, the performance of an ion-exchange process depends on a complex interrelationship between several parameters, such as protein properties, mobile phase conditions, and chromatographic resin characteristics. Consequently, batch variations of ion exchange resins play a significant role in the robustness of these downstream processing steps. Ligand density is known to be one of the main lot-to-lot variations, affecting protein adsorption and separation performance. The use of a model-based approach can be an effective tool for comprehending the impact of parameter variations (e.g., ligand density) and their influence on the process. The objective of this work was to apply mechanistic modeling to gain a deeper understanding of the influence of ligand density variations in anion exchange chromatography. To achieve this, 13 prototype resins having the same support as the strong anion exchange resin Fractogel(R) EMD TMAE (M), but differing in ligand density, were analyzed. Linear salt gradient elution experiments were performed to observe the elution behavior of a monoclonal antibody and bovine serum albumin.

Interactions between wild and domestic birds, humans and swine can lead to spillover events. Backyard livestock systems in proximity to wetlands represent high-risk areas for viral spread. However, some gaps remain in our knowledge of IAV transmission at the wildlife-livestock interface in Mexico. Hence, the study aimed at molecular identification and phylogenetic characterization of IAV in the wild duck-backyard livestock interface at a wetland of Mexico. A total of 875 animals were tested by real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). We detected IAV in 3.68% of the wild ducks sampled during the winter season 2016-2017. Nonetheless, the samples obtained from backyard poultry and swine tested negative. The highest IAV frequency (11.10%) was found in the Mexican duck (Anas diazi). Subtypes H1N1, H3N2 and H5N2 were detected. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that IAV detected in wild birds from the Lerma wetlands was mostly related to swine and poultry IAV strains previously isolated in the United States and Mexico. Except, the UIFMVZ377/H5N2 related to North American waterbirds. In conclusion, the co-circulation of three IAV subtypes in wild ducks close to backyard farms in Mexico, as well as the local identification of influenza viruses genetically related to Mexican and North American IAV strains, highlights the importance of the Lerma marshes for influenza surveillance given the close interaction among wild birds, poultry, pigs and humans.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 4797}

Methods This is a population-based, prospective, examiner-masked study with annual follow-up. Patients are 4- to 18-year-olds with high myopia. The participants will fill out questionnaires and then undergo visual acuity, axial length (AL), intraocular pressure, ophthalmologist assessment, microperimetry, cycloplegic refraction, Pentacam, wavefront aberration, fundus, blood and saliva examinations. To describe the pilot data, intergroup differences were assessed with t-tests or analysis of variance and a logistic regression model was used to determine the independent factors associated with peripapillary atrophy (PPA). Results Overall, 134 eyes of 79 participants met the pilot study recruitment criteria. The mean AL and spherical equivalent were 26.91 +/- 1.07 mm and -9.40 +/- 1.77 D, respectively. Peripapillary atrophy (PPA) (N = 112) and tessellated fundus (N = 67) were the most common fundus changes. The mean AL was significantly longer in PPA (27.08 +/- 0.93 mm) than in non-PPA eyes (26.06 +/- 1.31 mm; p < 0.001). Axial length (AL) (p = 0.041) was the only independent factor associated with PPA. Axial length (AL) was significantly longer in eyes with diffuse chorioretinal atrophy (N = 11; 28.02 +/- 1.31 mm) than without myopic retinal lesions (N = 56; 26.48 +/- 0.91 mm, p < 0.001) or with tessellated fundus (N = 67; 27.09 +/- 0.97 mm, p = 0.012). The myopic degree was higher in eyes with diffuse chorioretinal atrophy than without myopic retinal lesions (-10.51 +/- 2.76 D versus -9.06 +/- 1.58 D, p = 0.039). Conclusion Peripapillary atrophy and tessellated fundus were common in children and adolescents with high myopia.

{"label": "NEG", "text": "The use of diesel fuel in crop and transportation operations is responsible for one third of the carbon emissions in sugarcane biorefineries. A possible solution is to replace it with biodiesel from lipids, directly produced from sugarcane by highly productive heterotrophic microalgae. In this study a heterotrophic microalgae biodiesel plant, integrated with a typical Brazilian sugarcane bio-refinery, was designed and evaluated. Molasses, steam, and electricity from sugarcane processing were used as inputs for microalgae production. For a non-integrated plant, the production cost of the microalgae biodiesel was estimated at 2.51 and 2.27 $/liter for fed-batch and continuous processes, respectively. Equipment for cultivation and carbon sources was the highest cost affecting the financial feasibility of the proposed design. For the integrated plant, at present ethanol and biodiesel selling prices, the profitability would be lower than a first-generation sugarcane bio-refinery using fossil diesel fuel for its operations. However, the CO2 emissions would be reduced by up to 50 000 x 10(3) kg per year at a cost of $83 10(-3) kg(-1) CO2-eq.

Seventy-one percent of responding programs reported mandatory didactic training pertaining to frail and functionally dependent geriatric adults. Ninety-nine percent of respondents reported that residents provided treatment to geriatric patients; however, they were less likely to perform procedures on frail and functionally dependent patients. Only 15% of respondents provided nursing home care. Considering all patient encounters, responding GPR programs were more likely than AEGD programs to treat patients using IV bisphosphonates (63% vs 25%; P < .01), undergoing chemotherapy (48% vs 16%; P = .02), and undergoing head and neck radiation therapy (55% vs 25%; P = .02).

Methods : All seed plant species were recorded on 76 plots between 400 and 4100 m. Regression models were used to identify the variables with highest predictive power for species densities of different life forms and leaf traits. Results : Species density showed a linear elevational decline except for grasses (increase) and epiphytes (hump-shaped pattern) and were related to temperature and precipitation in all considered life forms. Tree leaf size, the proportion of species with simple leaves and leaves with drip tips decreased with elevation, while the proportion of toothed leaves increased. Conclusions : Our data partly confirm some widely held assumptions about elevation patterns in species density and leaf traits. While the climatic dependence behaves as expected, leaf traits and lifeforms show mixed and sometimes surprising patterns.

This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the potential association between adherence to the MedDiet and periodontitis, which is highly prevalent in young Moroccan individuals. Methods We evaluated 1075 Moroccan individuals (72% women, mean [standard deviation] age = 20.2 [1.5] years). Adherence to the MedDiet was assessed using the MedDiet score (MDS) based on the frequency of intake of eight food groups (vegetables, legumes, fruits, cereals or potatoes, fish, red meat, dairy products, and olive oil). A value of 0 (unhealthy) or 1 (healthy) was assigned to each food group, and the MDS (range, 0-8 points) was generated by adding the individual scores, with a higher score indicating better adherence to the MedDiet. The logistic regression model was used to evaluate the MDS (high [5-8 points]/low [0-4 points]) and each component score (1/0) with the presence of periodontitis, which was determined through full-mouth periodontal examinations. Age, sex, and oral health behavior were considered as potential confounders. Results In total, 693 (64.5%) study participants showed high MDSs. Periodontitis was observed in 71 (6.6%) participants. No significant association between MDS and periodontitis was observed. Nonetheless, olive oil consumption, a component of the MDS, showed a significant inverse association with periodontitis (adjusted odds ratio = 0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.32-0.96). Conclusions The MedDiet was not significantly associated with periodontitis among young Moroccans.

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Background Acidosis-induced kidney injury is mediated by the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system, for which urinary renin is a potential marker. Therefore, we hypothesized that sodium bicarbonate supplementation reduces urinary renin excretion in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and metabolic acidosis. Methods Patients with CKD stage G4 and plasma bicarbonate 15-24 mmol/l were randomized to receive sodium bicarbonate (3 x 1000 mg/day, similar to 0.5 mEq/kg), sodium chloride (2 x 1,00 mg/day), or no treatment for 4 weeks (n = 15/arm). The effects on urinary renin excretion (primary outcome), other plasma and urine parameters of the renin-angiotensin system, endothelin-1, and proteinuria were analyzed. Results Forty-five patients were included (62 +/- 15 years, eGFR 21 +/- 5 ml/min/1.73m(2), plasma bicarbonate 21.7 +/- 3.3 mmol/l). Sodium bicarbonate supplementation increased plasma bicarbonate (20.8 to 23.8 mmol/l) and reduced urinary ammonium excretion (15 to 8 mmol/day, both P < 0.05). Furthermore, a trend towards lower plasma aldosterone (291 to 204 ng/L, P = 0.07) and potassium (5.1 to 4.8 mmol/l, P = 0.06) was observed in patients receiving sodium bicarbonate. Sodium bicarbonate did not significantly change the urinary excretion of renin, angiotensinogen, aldosterone, endothelin-1, albumin, or alpha 1-microglobulin. Sodium chloride supplementation reduced plasma renin (166 to 122 ng/L), and increased the urinary excretions of angiotensinogen, albumin, and alpha 1-microglobulin (all P < 0.05). Conclusions Despite correction of acidosis and reduction in urinary ammonium excretion, sodium bicarbonate supplementation did not improve urinary markers of the renin-angiotensin system, endothelin-1, or proteinuria.

Here, we investigate if EVs secreted from P. aeruginosa alter DNA methylation in human lung macrophages, thereby potentially contributing to a dysfunctional innate immune response. Using a genome-wide DNA methylation approach, we demonstrate that P. aeruginosa EVs alter certain host cell DNA methylation patterns. We identified 1,185 differentially methylated CpGs (FDR < 0.05), which were significantly enriched for distal DNA regulatory elements including enhancer regions and DNase hypersensitive sites. Notably, all but one of the 1,185 differentially methylated CpGs were hypomethylated in association with EV exposure. Significantly hypomethylated CpGs tracked to genes including AXL, CFB and CCL23. Gene expression analysis identified 310 genes exhibiting significantly altered expression 48 hours post P. aeruginosa EV treatment, with 75 different genes upregulated and 235 genes downregulated. Some CpGs associated with cytokines such as CSF3 displayed strong negative correlations between DNA methylation and gene expression. Our infection model illustrates how secreted products (EVs) from bacteria can alter DNA methylation of the host epigenome. Changes in DNA methylation in distal DNA regulatory regions in turn can modulate cellular gene expression and potential downstream cellular processes.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 4893}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Underperformed interfacial bond and anisotropic properties are often observed in three-dimensional-printed concrete, where the printing pattern is unidirectional. Such issues could be potentially alleviated by replicating microstructures of natural materials or applying different architectures, where printed layers are arranged into unique and unconventional patterns. Furthermore, the quest to develop printing methods for highly complex or self-support concrete architecture could benefit from these nature-inspired patterns. In this work, the influences of different architectural arrangements of layers on mechanical properties of hardened concrete on compressive and flexural strengths are investigated. Specifically, unidirectional (0 degrees), cross-ply (0 degrees/90 degrees), quasi-isotropic (0 degrees/ +/- 45 degrees/90 degrees), and helicoidal patterns (with pitch angles of 10 degrees, 20 degrees, and 30 degrees) are used to create unidirectional, bidirectional, and multidirectional layers in printed objects without and with 0.75% by volume of 6 mm-long steel fibers. The experimental results demonstrate considerable improvements in the flexural strengths of nontraditional specimens without steel fibers over the unidirectional control with a few exceptions. Among investigated patterns, the quasi-isotropic demonstrates significant influences in both compressive and flexural responses of printed concrete samples without steel fibers. The addition of steel fibers leads to noticeable improvement on both compressive and flexural strengths of samples in any pattern compared with their counterparts without fibers. Besides, the inclusion of steel fibers into unconventional layups (cross-ply, quasi-isotropic, and helicoidal patterns) leads to the alleviation of directional dependence of mechanical properties, which is a limitation of the unidirectional samples with fibers. Of all helicoidal patterns, the one with a 10 degrees-angle layup is shown to be more beneficial to the flexural strength enhancement and damage resistance in bending. X-ray microcomputed tomography measurements are performed to visualize the direction and distribution of fibers.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 4897}

Birds have a single distal tarsal ossification center that fuses to the proximal metatarsals to form a new adult skeletal structure: the composite tarsometatarsus. This ossification center develops within a single large embryonic cartilage, but it is unclear if this cartilage results from fusion of earlier cartilages. We studied embryos in species from four different bird orders, an alligatorid, and an iguanid. In all embryos, cartilages dt2, dt3, and dt4 are formed. In the alligatorid and the iguanid, dt2 failed to ossify: only dt3 and dt4 develop into adult bones. In birds, dt2, dt3, and dt4 fuse to form the large distal tarsal cartilage; the ossification center then develops above mt3, in cartilage presumably derived from dt3. During the entire dinosaur-bird transition, a dt2 embryonic cartilage was always formed, as inferred from the embryology of extant birds and crocodilians. We propose that in the evolution of the avian ankle, fusion of cartilages dt3 and dt2 allowed ossification from dt3 to progress into dt2, which began to contribute bone medially, while fusion of dt3 to dt4 enabled the evolutionary loss of the dt4 ossification center. As a result, a single ossification center expands into a plate-like unit covering the proximal ends of the metatarsals, that is key to the development of an integrated tarsometatarsus.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 4902}

We present a sufficient condition on operators on H which takes a K-dual frame pairs to other ones; characterize bounded linear operators on l(2)(J) that transform K-dual frame pairs to other ones; prove that two Bessel sequences can always be extended to a K-dual frame pair, and that two orthogonal K-frames have a common K-dual Bessel sequence under certain conditions; and obtain a sufficient condition which the K-duals of one K-frame is contained in the ones of another K-frames.

Each country is exploring how to improve themselves in terms of science and technology. The authors analyzed the innovation capabilities of 35 OECD countries that have not recently joined Lithuania. Design/methodology/approach In recent years, a lot of research work has been done on trapezoidal interval type-2 fuzzy sets (TIT-2 FS), and many research works have been published. The trapezoidal interval type-2 fuzzy set helps effectively to represent the uncertainty comparatively than the type-1 fuzzy set. Taking advantage of this effectiveness, the authors extend the best multi-criteria decision making method (MCDM) for trapezoidal interval type-2 fuzzy sets. Here, ELimination and Choice Expressing REality III (ELECTRE III) method in the trapezoidal interval type-2 fuzzy set environment is proposed. Findings This analysis helps to the OECD countries to develop their level of innovation in the criteria. The authors are making this evaluation for the year 2018 based on the 31 criteria. Application of the proposed method expressed by evaluation of the national innovation capability problem. Based on the obtained results, the top five countries are United States, Switzerland, Canada, Germany and Japan. Originality/value The authors collected required data from different available data sources like OECD, IMD, USPTO, ITU and surveyed data reported by KISTEP. After collecting all the data from different sources, the authors calculated the standard values as KISTEP. After converting the standard values into trapezoidal interval type-2 fuzzy values, the authors construct a decision matrix based on these values. Then, the authors determined the possibility mean values and preference. Then, they calculated the concordance and discordance credibility degree values. Finally, they ranked OECD countries by the net credibility degree. The results are computed by using the MATLAB software.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 4922}

Adopting a positive perspective, we show that CSR objectives, which induce a firm to expand production, have ambiguous wage and employment consequences in case of wage negotiations and raise employment if there is efficient bargaining.

In this study, we aimed to characterize the long-term cognitive effects of ECT in patients with late-life depression (LLD) from before the start until 4 years after the index ECT course. Methods Fourty one patients aged 55 years and older with a unipolar depression, referred for ECT, were included. The neuropsychological test battery was assessed prior to ECT, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, and 4 years after the last ECT session. Results We did not find any statistically significant cognitive changes from before the start to 4 years after ending the ECT course. Although we could not detect cognitive changes at group level, we found clinically important differences on an individual level. Conclusion Cognitive performance in patients with LLD runs a stable course from before the start of ECT until 4 years after the index course. At an individual level, however, both cognitive decline and improvement can be witnessed. Older patients can tolerate ECT and most of them will not experience long-term cognitive side effects.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 4955}

In the levelling method, airborne geophysical data from the entire survey area are corrected automatically after sorting the data into a group according to the measurement order. Variational mode decomposition is applied to the profile data to adaptively extract the level-error component with distinct spectral bands. In airborne geophysical surveys, data in the anomalous region show visible peaks with strong gradients along the flight-line direction, which would impact the decomposition. To minimize their effect on variational mode decomposition, the higher amplitude anomalies are grouped and discarded by K-means clustering to obtain the real data level. The levelling method extracts the level errors of the entire survey area simultaneously, thus avoiding the regional error caused by strong noise, missing data or error transfer in the common levelling process. Moreover, the approach is automatic and applicable to both irregular and regular line patterns without the participation of staff members or tie-line control. The levelling method may require much time when decomposition is performed on the extended survey area.

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Purpose Industrialized construction (IC) has accelerated the technological advancements of construction supply chains (SCs) in Hong Kong (HK). However, the usually fragmented IC SCs often lead to friction and turbulence that retard their performance. Streamlining these workflows call for resilient SCs that can proactively overcome various vulnerabilities and avoid disruptions. Having identified supply chain capabilities (SCC) as essential precursors to supply chain resilience (SCR), this paper reports on a vital segment of a study on SCC for IC in HK that focused here on critical SCC (CSCC). Specifically, this paper aims at identifying and probing the CSCC for improving SCR in IC in HK. Design/methodology/approach After drawing on the plentiful relevant literature, an empirical study using a questionnaire survey and interviews was conducted following the multi-stage methodological framework of this study. Relevant significance analysis of the collected data enabled the selection of CSCC. Next, factor analysis facilitated grouping them under nine underlying components. Findings The results reveal 41 CSCC pertinent to achieve resilient SCs in IC in HK under critical capability components of resourcefulness, flexibility, capacity, adaptability, efficiency, financial strength, visibility, anticipation and dispersion. Originality/value It is expected that industry practitioners would benefit from prior knowledge of CSCC and their levels of criticalities, so as to prioritize integrating them suitably into SC processes, to develop value-enhanced-resilient SCs. Further, these findings lay the foundations for developing a powerful evaluation model to assess, then improve, SCR in IC in HK by mapping the identified CSCC with relevant critical vulnerabilities, based on study outcomes.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 4999}

This paper aims to present a method for predicting the fatigue life of laminated rubber spherical thrust elastomeric bearings. Design/methodology/approach First, the mechanical properties of standard rubber samples were tested; the axial stiffness, cocking stiffness, torsional stiffness and fatigue life of several full-size spherical thrust elastomeric bearings were tested. Then, the stiffness results were calculated using the neo-Hookean, Mooney-Rivlin and Yoeh models. Using a modified Mooney-Rivlin constitutive model, this paper proposes an improved method for fatigue life prediction, which considers the laminated characteristics of a spherical thrust elastomeric bearing and loads of multiple multi-axle conditions. Findings The Mooney-Rivlin model could accurately describe the stiffness characteristics of the spherical thrust elastomeric bearings. A comparative analysis of experimental results shows that the model can effectively predict the life of a spherical thrust elastomeric bearing within its range of use and the prediction error is within 20%.

In particular, the authors derive alternative models from our analysis (benchmarked on technology acceptance model and unified theory of acceptance and use of technology) for a better explanation of the formation of the intentions, and, more importantly, cultural factors would affect such formation, as informed by the Hofstede Cultural Dimensions.

Methods A cross-sectional study design was applied to a 2016 census of 3804 health facilities in Ethiopia. The availability of an institutional-level RMC index was computed as the availability of all nine items identified as important aspects of institutional-level RMC during childbirth. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with availability of the index. Results Three components of the institutional-level RMC index were identified: \"RMC policy,\" \"RMC experience,\" and \"facility for provision of RMC.\" Overall, 28% of facilities (hospitals, 29.9%; health centers, 27.8%) reported availability of the institutional-level RMC index. Facility location urbanization (urban region), percentage of maternal and newborn health workers trained in basic emergency obstetric and newborn care, and availability of maternity waiting homes in health facilities were positively associated with availability of the institutional-level RMC index. Conclusion Only one in three facilities reported availability of the institutional-level RMC index. The Ethiopian government should consider strengthening support mechanisms in different administrative regions (urban, pastoralist, and agrarian), implementing the provision training for health workers that incorporates RMC components, and increasing the availability of maternity waiting homes.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 5032}

It takes advantages of both high refractive index contrast and high luminescence brightness, which allows the optical modulation on not only the reflection of illumination, but also the light emission from hybrid perovskites. The distributed feedback within these periodic structures significantly improves the degree of polarization and directionality of laser actions while their threshold is also reduced.

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas, is reduced to N-2 gas by N2O-reducing bacteria (N2ORB), a process which represents an N2O sink in natural and engineered ecosystems. The N2O sink activity by N2ORB depends on temperature and O-2 exposure, yet the specifics are not yet understood. This study explores the effects of temperature and oxygen exposure on biokinetics of pure culture N2ORB. Four N2ORB, representing either clade I type nosZ (Pseudomonas stutzeri JCM5965 and Paracoccus denitrificans NBRC102528) or clade II type nosZ (Azospira sp. strains I09 and I13), were individually tested. The higher activation energy for N2O by Azospira sp. strain I13 (114.0 +/- 22.6 kJ mol(-1)) compared with the other tested N2ORB (38.3-60.1 kJ mol(-1)) indicates that N2ORB can adapt to different temperatures. The O-2 inhibition constants (K-I) of Azospira sp. strain I09 and Ps. stutzeri JCM5965 increased from 0.06 +/- 0.05 and 0.05 +/- 0.02 mu mol L-1 to 0.92 +/- 0.24 and 0.84 +/- 0.31 mu mol L-1, respectively, as the temperature increased from 15 degrees C to 35 degrees C, while that of Azospira sp. strain I13 was temperature-independent (p = 0.106). Within the range of temperatures examined, Azospira sp. strain I13 had a faster recovery after O-2 exposure compared with Azospira sp. strain I09 and Ps. stutzeri JCM5965 (p < 0.05). These results suggest that temperature and O-2 exposure result in the growth of ecophysiologically distinct N2ORB as N2O sinks.

We show through simulation studies that an adaptively penalized Kolmogorov-Smirnov (apKS) method improves the estimation of the power law interval on random samples from various theoretical probability distributions.

The main objectives of this research were: (a) determine the sensitivity response of 10 feral rye populations collected from Kansas wheat fields to quizalofop-p-ethyl in a dose-response assay, and (b) to determine the effectiveness of various rates and application timings (fall or spring) of quizalofop-p-ethyl for feral rye control in quizalofop-resistant winter wheat in the CGP. Dose-response assays indicated that all tested feral rye populations were highly sensitive to quizalofop-p-ethyl with GR(90) values (doses of quizalofop-p-ethyl needed for 90% reductions in shoot biomass at 3 wk after treatment) ranging from 33 to 72 g a.i. ha(-1).

Objective: The aim of the study was to look for the impact of hypouricemic therapy using allopurinol on serum level of 25 (OH) vit D in CKD patients. Cases and Methods: Seventy-two CKD stage 3-5 patients were selected to this study. Patients with SUA above 7 mg/dL were allocated to hypouricemic therapy using allopurinol (group I). A control group of cases not suffering marked increase in SUA were included as control group (group II). All cases were followed up for 3 months. Serum Cr, SUA, ionized calcium (SiCa), phosphorus, 25 (OH) vitD, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and 24-h urine protein were estimated at entry and by the end of the study. Results: At least 20 cases completed the study in each group. Serum 25 (OH) vit D significantly increased in group I (26.4 [14.1] vs. 39.6 [14.8] at entry vs. at end of the study, p < 0.001). In addition, SUA, PTH, and urine protein significantly decreased (11 [1.6] vs. 3.95 [0.58] mg/dL, 267.5 [97.5] vs. 225.5 [153] ng/mL, and 2.7 [1.18] vs. 1.5 [1.08] gm/day, p < 0.001, = 0.043, and <0.001 respectively).

Yet, postimplementation adoption rates remain low in hospitals where BSR has been introduced. Further research is needed to understand what content is most appropriate to discuss during BSR and what facilitators are from the clinical nurses' perspective. Aims: Identify and describe acute care clinical nurses' and nursing supervisors' experiences and opinions regarding: process of BSR, appropriate content for BSR and barriers and facilitators related to implementation of BSR. Design: A phenomenological qualitative study was conducted at an acute care 500 bed, not-for-profit academic medical centre located in the southern United States. Methods: Clinical nurses (N = 22) and nursing supervisors (N = 12) from every inpatient division were recruited and interviewed. The data were analysed for relationships, similarities and differences. Themes were then identified by two independent researchers. Results: Five themes were identified: (a) time constraints and clinical nurse's workflow must be taken into consideration; (b) a modified approach is necessary; (c) process and specific critical content should be individualized so that it is meaningful for all parties involved; (d) specific critical content that should be discussed outside the patient's room; and (e) specific critical content that should be discussed inside the patient's room. Conclusions: One way to minimize interruptions is to conduct BSR using a modified approach, where a portion of the hand-off occurs inside and outside the patient's room. In addition, this study identified the nurses' preferred location where specific critical topics should be discussed. Relevance to clinical practice: Results from this study should be used to inform the practice BSR so the desired outcomes of patient and family satisfaction, nursing quality and patient safety can be realized.

Initially, a PID controller is considered, and the effectiveness of hHHO-PS technique is compared with original Harris hawks optimization (HHO) as well as genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) techniques. In the next stage, superiority of proposed T2FFOPID over PID, type-1 fuzzy PID (T1FPID), and fuzzy fractional order PID (T1FFOPID) controller is demonstrated. To authenticate the effectiveness of the suggested control method, different load disturbances as well as various rates of solar and wind sources penetration have been considered. The suggested control approach displays significant improvement in dynamic responses with fast damping of oscillations. Investigations of results affirm the better performance of T2FFOPID over other controllers regarding minutest error criteria and undershoot/overshoot of frequency deviations at various disturbances. Additionally, sensitivity analysis validates the robust conduct of T2FFOPID controller under variations parameters and communication delay.

In order to improve our understanding of the risk factors associated with IS, we investigated the combined effect of the methylation of five genes related to the metabolism of homocysteine on developing IS. Methods Quantitative methylation-specific PCR was used to measure the levels of promoter methylation in hypertensive and stroke patients. The cutoff value calculated by the maximum Youden index was used to classify the levels of gene methylation as hypomethylation and hypermethylation. Logistic regression was used to explore the relationship between gene methylation and IS. Results The methylation levels of the genes encoding methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 1 [MTHFD1], cystathionine beta-synthase [CBS], and dihydrofolate reductase [DHFR] in hypertensive patients were higher than those in stroke patients (all p < 0.01). MTHFD1 hypermethylation, CBS hypermethylation, and DHFR hypermethylation were protective factors for stroke after adjustment for confounding factors. Compared with individuals carrying none of the biomarkers, the ORs [95% CIs] for stroke of those with 1 and 2 elevated biomarkers were 4.068 [1.670-9.913] and 15.345 [6.198-37.994] after adjustment for confounding factors. The participants with a larger number of biomarkers had an increased risk of stroke (p for trend <0.001). For the combination biomarkers, the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic was 0.716.

The judgment that what is familiar has been experienced before is a product of reflection, and is no part of the feeling of familiarity, such as a horse may be supposed to have when he returns to his stable.", "group": "PHIL", "id": 5062}

In this study, we identified CD166 as a novel marker expressed in the sphere-forming CSC population of A2780 epithelial ovarian cancer cells and primary ovarian cancer cells. The CD166(+) cells isolated from A2780 cells and primary ovarian cancer cells highly expressed CSC markers, including ALDH1a1, OCT4, and SOX2, and ABC transporters, which are implicated in the drug resistance of CSCs. The CD166(+) cells exhibited enhanced CSC-like properties, such as increased sphere-forming ability, cell migration and adhesion abilities, resistance to conventional anti-cancer drugs, and high tumorigenic potential in a xenograft mouse model. Knockdown of CD166 expression in the sphere-forming ovarian CSCs abrogated their CSC-like properties. Moreover, silencing of CD166 expression in the sphere-forming CSCs suppressed the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase, paxillin, and SRC.

Demographic information, clinical and laboratory examination, severity model scoring, and 90-day outcomes were studied. Area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was analyzed to compare the predictive value of different prognostic scoring methods. Results: 2099 CAP patients with a median age of 60 (IQR 44.0-73.0) years-old were included in this study. Median length of stay was 10 days (IQR 8.0-13.0). The all-cause 90-day mortality was found in 2.19% (46/2099) of all patients. PCT was identified as an independent predictor for the prognosis of CAP patients. CURB-65 in combination with PCT outperformed other predictive methods in 90-day mortality with the optimal AUC of 0.900 and Youden's Index of 0.706.

First of all, confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) were used to verify the factor structure of the WPPSI-IV, which was proposed by the test developers. Then, multiple-group confirmatory factor models were implemented to explore measurement invariance across gender. Finally, mean differences in the subtests, index scores, as well as full scale IQ (FSIQ) were analyzed. The second-order three-factor model for age group 2:6-3:11 as well as the second-order five-factor model for age group 4:0-7:7 could be verified. For age group 2:6-3:11, full scalar invariance could be accepted, whereas partial scalar invariance could be established by freeing five nonequivalent subtest intercepts for age group 4:0-7:7. These findings support interpretable comparisons of the WPPSI-IV scores between girls and boys. For age group 4:0-7:7, partial invariance should be taken into account in these comparisons. Furthermore, girls aged 4:0-7:7 showed an advantage in processing speed (PS). Mean scores in any of the other cognitive abilities did not differ between girls and boys in both age groups. These results indicated measurement invariance across gender on the WPPSI-IV, so that the tests measure cognitive abilities in the same way for girls and boys.

{"label": "NEG", "text": "The concept of matrix rigidity was first introduced by Valiant in 1977. Roughly speaking, a matrix is rigid if its rank cannot be reduced significantly by changing a small number of entries. There has been considerable interest in the explicit construction of rigid matrices as Valiant showed in his MFCS'77 paper that explicit families of rigid matrices can be used to prove lower bounds for arithmetic circuits. In a surprising recent result, Alman and Williams (FOCS'19) showed that the 2(n) x 2(n) Walsh-Hadamard matrix, which was conjectured to be rigid, is actually not very rigid. This line of work was extended by Dvir and Edelman (Theory of Computing, 2019) to a family of matrices related to the Walsh-Hadamard matrix, but over finite fields. In the present paper we take another step in this direction and show that for any abelian group G and function f : G -> C, the G-circulant matrix, given by M-xy = f (x - y) for x,y is an element of G, is not rigid over C. Our results also hold if we replace C with a finite field F-q and require that gcd(q, vertical bar G vertical bar) = 1. En route to our main result, we show that circulant and Toeplitz matrices (over finite fields or C) and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) matrices (over C) are not sufficiently rigid to carry out Valiant's approach to proving circuit lower bounds. This complements a recent result of Goldreich and Tal (Comp. Complexity, 2018) who showed that Toeplitz matrices are nontrivially rigid (but not enough for Valiant's method). Our work differs from previous non-rigidity results in that those papers considered matrices whose underlying group of symmetries was of the form Z(p)(n) with p fixed and n tending to infinity, while in the families of matrices we study, the underlying group of symmetries can be any abelian group and, in particular, the cyclic group Z(N), which has very different structure.

Method This was a retrospective, observational, cohort study of patients with COVID-19 disease within a New York City Health System. Adult patients were included if they tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and had a serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D level (25(OH)D) within the three previous months prior to their detected SARS-CoV-2 test. Patients were compared and evaluated based upon their 25(OH)D levels. The primary endpoints were hospitalization, need for oxygen support, and 90-day mortality. Results 437 COVID-19 patients were included [67 (IQR: 56-79) years] within this cohort.

The WBV can increase muscle mass in dogs with muscular atrophy. As Whole-body vibration (WBV) can be used as exercise modality with no impact on the joints, the present study aimed to evaluate the effects of single session of WBV in hematobiochemical and hemogasometric parameters in adult and elderly healthy dogs. Materials, Methods & Results: Fourteen clinically healthy, neutered crossbreed male dogs, non-athlete were selected. The dogs were divided into two groups of seven dogs, according to the age group: Group I - adult dogs (GI): age between 12.0 and 84.0 months old; Group II - elderly dogs (GU): age above 84.0 months old. All dogs were submitted to a single session WBV by using a vibrating platform that delivered a vortex wave circulation as mechanical vibration. The WBV protocol used was 30 Hz frequency (3.10 mm peak displacement; 11.16 m/s(2) peak acceleration; 0.29 m/s velocity), then 50 Hz (3.98 mm peak displacement; 39.75 m/s(2) peak acceleration; 0.62 m/s velocity), and lastly 30 Hz (3.10 mm peak displacement; 11.16 m/s(2) peak acceleration; 0.29 m/s velocity) for 5-min between de frequencies. The hematobiochemical and hemagasometric parameters were evaluated at 1-min before the WBV session (1PRE), 1-min after the WBV session (1POST), 120-min (120POST) and 24 h after the WBV session (24hPOST). The dogs accepted the vibration stimulus quite well, however, elderly dogs weighing above 30 kg were more likely to sit down with increased frequency from 30 to 50 Hz. No variations of food and water intakes and gastrointestinal changes were observed after the WBV session. Hemoglobin values showed significant decrease (P = 0.0312) between 1PRE and 1POST in elderly dogs. A significant decrease (P = 0.0453) was observed in alanine aminotransferase values between 120POST and 14hPOST in adult dogs. Creatinine values had a statistical decrease (P = 0.0173) between 1PRE and 24hPOST in adult dogs. However, these values remained within the reference range for dogs. Discussion: According to the literature, there are no studies related to the effects of WBV in haematobiochemical and hemogasometric parameters in adult and elderly dogs. No deleterious effects regarding a single session of WBV were observed, however harmful effects were observed in human patients. The elderly dogs with body mass above 30 kg tried to sit during the increased frequency from 30 to 50 Hz, which was associated with the pressure exerted in their paws. No significant differences were observed in erythrogram and leukogram parameters except for hemoglobin values. Significant decline was observed in hemoglobin values in adult Beagle dogs; and were associated with hemolysis. The significant decrease in alanine aminotransferase and creatinine values did not have clinical significance. No significant alterations were identified in hemogasometric parameters but slight increase in pH values was observed in horses subjected to a 60 km run, and was associated with the loss of CI ions in sweat. The single session of WBV by using a vibrating platform that delivered a vortex wave circulation, at 30 and 50 Hz frequencies for 5 min did not induce significant changes in hematobiocheinical and hemogasometric parameters in adults and elderly healthy dogs.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 5090}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Aquatic invertebrate communities inhabiting intermittent rivers that are characterised by recurrent drying events (flow cessation or complete disappearance of surface water) often show rapid recovery upon flow resumption. Such rapid recovery is possible thanks to specific resistance and resilience traits that species adapted to river drying often exhibit. However, differences in community response to drying can be expected between historically drying (HD) networks-those IRs with a long history of flow intermittence-and recently drying (RD) networks, where drying is a novel, often human-induced, phenomenon. The invertebrate species found in RD networks may lack the adaptations that are known to facilitate quick community recovery upon rewetting and could thus be dramatically affected by drying. Unfortunately, the responses of aquatic communities in RD networks are still poorly explored, limiting our capacity to predict and mitigate future biodiversity changes. Here, we compared the responses of aquatic invertebrate communities to drying in nine pairs of intermittent and perennial river reaches from HD networks across France and nine pairs from RD networks across the Czech Republic. Using both taxonomic and functional perspectives, differences in alpha- and beta-diversity patterns between perennial and intermittent sites were evaluated separately for HD and RD groups, and before and after drying over several years. Drying had stronger effects on taxonomic richness in RD compared to HD networks. In addition, drying greatly altered spatial and temporal beta-diversity in RD networks, but it marginally affected beta-diversity in HD networks. Communities of HD networks showed a higher proportion of resistant taxa than RD networks. These results suggest that recent drying can have, at least on a short time scale (i.e. years), stronger effects on aquatic communities in RD networks compared to those in HD networks. Because drying duration, frequency, and spatial extent are increasing with climate change, RD networks could soon reach tipping points, calling for long-term monitoring of biodiversity in these novel ecosystems.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 5094}

Scholars advocate the crucial role of channel integration quality (CIQ)-specifically its components of channel-service configuration and integrated interactions-in formulating the customer experience, which in turn determines their patronage intention. However, a dearth of research exists on the dynamic nature of this particular mechanism. The potential mediating and moderating effects of customer empowerment and Internet usage have hardly been considered at all in the context of omnichannel retailing. These research gaps will be addressed in this study. Design/methodology/approach Based on a data set of 312 omnichannel customers, the partial least square-structural equation model (PLS-SEM) was employed to test the hypothesised relationships. Findings The results reveal the dynamic mechanism in which channel-service configuration and integrated interactions are the key factors that not only directly enable omnichannel retailers to deliver customers with a seamless shopping experience but also empower customers to shape their own consumption experiences. The findings also demonstrate the contingency role of consumers' Internet usage in such a dynamic mechanism. Finally, the notion that a strong customer experience increases their intention for patronage is supported by the empirical evidence. Originality/value This study contributes to the existing literature by quantitatively examining the moderated mediating mechanism of forming customer experience and its subsequent patronage behaviour in the context of omnichannel retailers.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 5097}

One method, the \"hot steep,\" is a hot water extract that is highly reproducible and able to distinguish malt flavor. However, the chemistry of the hot steep extracts has not been fully defined, and the links between specific metabolites of the hot steep and their resulting sensory attributes remains largely unknown. Here, a study was designed to describe the metabolite chemistry of hot steep extracts, and to characterize variation in this chemistry and corresponding sensory by comparative analysis of 12 commercial pale malts. Metabolomics was performed on the 12 malt hot steep extracts using three mass spectrometry platforms to detect volatiles (HS/SPME-GC-MS) and non-volatiles (UHPLC-TOF-MS and GC-MS). The analysis detected a total of 1,026 compounds including lipids, organic acids, esters, and Maillard Reaction Products (MRPs), of which 162 compounds (15.7%) varied among the 12 hot steep extracts. Sensory of the 12 hot steep extracts was performed using an integrated Check All That Apply and quantitative analysis method for 14 traits, and the data revealed cereal, grassy, and dough aromas were the attributes that varied. The metabolomics and sensory data were integrated using OPLS analysis. The analysis revealed 64 compounds strongly associated with cereal aroma and included MRPs. A total of 23 compounds were strongly associated with grassy aroma including alkane/alkenes, benzenoids, organic acids, lipids, and fatty acid esters. Taken together, these data highlight the utility of the hot steep extract to differentiate malt for flavor and chemistry and indicate specific compounds that drive the most dominant flavors observed in this population of pale malts.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 5110}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Active tumor-targeting drug delivery has great potency in cancer therapy. However, the targeting efficiency of traditional active tumor-targeting nanotherapeutic drugs is limited by the scarcity of their accessible targets/receptors in tumors. Here, a novel self-amplifying tumor-targeting strategy with a chain reaction mechanism is developed. A coagulation targeting peptide (GNQEQVSPLTLLKXC, termed A15)-decorated poly(L-glutamic acid)-graft-maleimide poly(ethylene glycol)/combretastatin A4 conjugate (A15-PLG-CA4) is prepared to obtain a self-amplifying nanotherapeutic platform homing to tumors. After administration to tumor-bearing mice, A15-PLG-CA4 starts a chain reaction cycle consisting of intratumoral hemorrhage, target FXIIIa amplification, blood clot binding, and CA4 release in tumors. In this way, A15-PLG-CA4 increases the level of its accessible targets (FXIIIa) in a manner of chain reaction. The FXIIIa activity at 8 h is 4.1-fold more than the one at 0 h in the C26 tumors treated with A15-PLG-CA4. The total CA4 concentration at 24 h is 2.9-fold more than the control. A15-PLG-CA4 shows a significantly higher antitumor effect against large C26 tumors (approximate to 500 mm(3)) thanks to the remarkable tumor-targeting ability compared with the control. Therefore, this report highlights the potential of the self-amplifying tumor-targeting strategy in the development of next generation active tumor-targeting nanotherapeutic drugs for tumor therapy.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 5142}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Background In this prospective study the Peyton 4-step approach of demonstration-deconstruction-comprehension (verbalization by the learner), and performance by the learner was compared to the PDCA cycle/Deming-Circle (Plan-Do-Check (video assisted self-monitoring)-Act) as a teaching method for surgical suturing and nodes with end performance as the primary objective. Methods Students of the third clinical semester in dental medicine were randomly selected to one of the two teaching methods. They completed a first course during the third clinical semester and a subsequent course during the fourth clinical semester. The focus was on learning surgical suturing techniques. Before the course started a questionnaire was handed out to both groups to evaluate their initial level of performance. Each course ended with a practical test to review the content of the course. The evaluation followed standardized parameters. Some of the test tasks in test one were repeated in test two to measure a horizontal as well as vertical difference in performance level. Results 53 students (Peyton: n = 28/18 female, 10 male; PDCA: n = 25/14 female, 11 male) have completed both courses. The evaluation of the subjective questionnaires showed that the members of the PDCA-groups achieved a higher subjective increase in performance. The objective results also indicated higher learning success in the PDCA-groups compared to the Peyton-Group. Discussion/Conclusion This study demonstrated significant learning success for both groups in their own self-assessment as well as in the results of the practical exercises. Subsequently, the superiority of the PDCA cycle could be shown for almost all criteria for surgical suturing techniques. Several studies prioritize the teaching of practical skills according to Peyton and consider step 3 (\"comprehension\") to be the essential factor. The PDCA cycle, which has its origins in industrial quality management, and its success can be understood from the perspective of learning theory in terms of Jean Piaget's model of equilibration. The necessity of active reflection on the learning content through practice constitutes the key element for transfer into long-term memory.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 5145}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "The topic of this work is on reliable resolving of J-coupled resonances in spectral envelopes from proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. These resonances appear as multiplets that none of the conventional nonderivative shape estimators can disentangle. However, the recently formulated nonconventional shape estimator, the derivative fast Pade transform (dFPT), has a chance to meet this challenge. In the preceding article with a polyethylene phantom, using the time signals encoded with water suppressed, the nonparametric dFPT was shown to be able to split apart the compound resonances that contain the known J-coupled multiplets. In the present work, we address the same proton NMR theme, but with sharply different initial conditions from encodings. The goal within the nonparametric dFPT is again to accurately resolve the J-coupled resonances with the same polyethylene phantom, but using raw time signals encoded without water suppression. The parallel work on the same problem employing two startlingly unequal time signals, encoded with and without water suppression in the preceding and the current articles, respectively, can offer an answer to a question of utmost practical significance. How much does water suppression during encoding time signals actually perturb the resonances near and farther away from the dominant water peak? This is why it is important to apply the same dFPT estimator to the time signals encoded without water suppression to complement the findings with water suppression. A notable practical side of this inquiry is in challenging the common wisdom, which invariably takes for granted that it is absolutely necessary to subtract water from the encoded time signals in order to extract meaningful information by way of NMR spectroscopy.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 5148}

Here, the work focuses on the co-dopant strategy of M0.1Sm0.1Ce0.8O2-delta (M = Yb, Gd, Sm, Nd, La) to study the defect association energy, and its subsequent effect on ionic conduction and power density. The electrolyte material with different co-dopants modifies the lattice parameter and bond length of cation-anion, which changes the defect-dopant interactions. Among the tested dopant, Nd0.1Sm0.1Ce0.8O2-delta exhibits the highest ionic conductivity of 34 mS cm1 at 550 ?C, which is nearly 2.3 times higher than the conventional Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-delta. This experimental observation validates the theoretically proposed concept of the balanced defect-dopant interactions at different sites leading to the reduction in defect association enthalpy. The experimental results were rationalized by calculating the defect association enthalpy for the co-doped system using density functional theory via one-cell method. The cell with Nd0.1Sm0.1Ce0.8O2-delta as an electrolyte shows a peak power density of 466 mW cm-2 at 550 ?C, which is twice higher than the cell containing standard Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-delta electrolyte (212 mW cm? 2).

Imaging of extracellular matrix in fibrotic lungs is important for evaluating its pathological condition as well as the distribution of drugs to pulmonary focus sites and their therapeutic effects. In this study, we compared techniques of staining the extracellular matrix with optical tissue-clearing treatment for developing three-dimensional imaging methods for focus sites in pulmonary fibrosis. Mouse models of pulmonary fibrosis were prepared via the intrapulmonary administration of bleomycin. Fluorescent-labeled tomato lectin, collagen I antibody, and Col-F, which is a fluorescent probe for collagen and elastin, were used to compare the imaging of fibrotic foci in intact fibrotic lungs. These lung samples were cleared using the Clear(T2) tissue-clearing technique. The cleared lungs were two dimensionally observed using laser-scanning confocal microscopy, and the images were compared with those of the lung tissue sections. Moreover, three-dimensional images were reconstructed from serial two-dimensional images. Fluorescent-labeled tomato lectin did not enable the visualization of fibrotic foci in cleared fibrotic lungs. Although collagen I in fibrotic lungs could be visualized via immunofluorescence staining, collagen I was clearly visible only until 40 mu m from the lung surface. Col-F staining facilitated the visualization of collagen and elastin to a depth of 120 mu m in cleared lung tissues. Furthermore, we visualized the three-dimensional extracellular matrix in cleared fibrotic lungs using Col-F, and the images provided better visualization than immunofluorescence staining. These results suggest that Clear(T2) tissue-clearing treatment combined with Col-F staining represents a simple and rapid technique for imaging fibrotic foci in intact fibrotic lungs. This study provides important information for imaging various organs with extracellular matrix-related diseases.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 5179}

For spinless nuclei such isotope shifts for two distinct transitions are expected to be linearly related, at least at leading order in a change of the nuclear mass and charge distribution. Looking for a breaking of linearity in so-called King plots was proposed as a novel method to search for physics beyond the standard model. In the light of the recent experimental progress in isotope shift spectroscopy, the sensitivity of these searches will become limited by the determination of the isotope masses and/or by nuclear effects which may induce nonlinearities at an observable level. In this work, we propose two possible generalizations of the traditional King plot that overcome these limitations by including additional isotope shift measurements, thus significantly extending the new physics reach of King plots in a purely spectroscopy-driven approach.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 5186}

Design/methodology/approach This paper is based on a case study following a quality improvement (QI) project in a medium-sized Swedish county council in the field of somatic care. The project involved eight health-care professionals, one designer, four patients and two relatives. A multiple data collection method over a period of ten months was used. It included individual interviews, e-mail correspondence and observations of workshops that covered the QI project. Findings The result shows tensions between QI work and the daily clinical work of the participants. These tensions primarily concern the conflict between fast and slow processes, the problem of moving between different fields of knowledge, being a resource for the individual clinic and the system and the participants' expectations and assumptions about roles and responsibilities in a QI project. Furthermore, these findings could be interpreted as signs of a development culture in the health-care context. Practical implications There are several practical implications. Among others, the insights can inspire how to approach and contextualize the current concepts, roles and methods of DT and user involvement so that they can be more easily understood and integrated into the existing culture and way of working in the health-care sector.

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Objective: To compare perioperative, functional, and oncologic outcomes between robot-assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN) and laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN) for renal hilar tumors. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent minimally invasive partial nephrectomy for renal hilar tumors at our institution between January 2014 and August 2018. The entire cohort was divided into two groups according to surgical approach: RAPN and LPN group. Perioperative, functional, and oncologic outcomes of the two groups were collected and compared. Results: A total of 116 patients with renal hilar tumors were identified, including 52 patients who underwent RAPN and 64 patients who underwent LPN, respectively. Demographic baseline characteristics were similar in two groups. There were no differences between the RAPN and LPN groups for operative time, transfusion rate, conversion rate, surgical margin, perioperative complication, and hospital stay. Compared with the LPN group, the RAPN group was associated with significant less estimated blood loss (100 vs 150 mL; p < 0.001), shorter warm ischemia time (20.3 vs 24.5 minutes; p = 0.001), and higher direct cost (p < 0.001). Percentage of estimated glomerular filtration rate change at 6 months after surgery was lower in RAPN group than LPN group (10.4% vs 15.2%; p = 0.020). No significant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of oncologic outcomes. Conclusions: For hilar tumors, both RAPN and LPN were safe and feasible surgical treatments. RAPN might be associated with superior perioperative outcomes (less estimated blood loss and shorter warm ischemia time) and better postoperative renal functional preservation. RAPN might be the preferred option when condition permits for renal hilar tumors.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 5217}

Recent studies that examined the relationship between high-confidence eyewitness identifications and accuracy proposed that the mechanism underlying this relationship may be based on a knowledge-conditional model. According to this model, the accuracy of a confidence judgment depends on knowledge about factors that affect memory accuracy. However, there has not been a comprehensive assessment of laypeople's knowledge about the effect on memory accuracy of many estimator variables known to influence the accuracy of eyewitnesses, specifically those relevant to research on the relationship between witness confidence and accuracy. This study consists of the development of a 30-item scale to assess laypeople's knowledge of the effect of 10 common estimator variables on memory accuracy from three points of view (POV): Self, Other, and Juror. Across MTurk and undergraduate samples, laypeople's beliefs about the effect of these estimator variables were generally consistent with research findings and did not differ as a function of POV. Additionally, for most estimator variables, participants' beliefs about memory were consistent with results in the confidence-accuracy literature; confidence and identification accuracy appear to be poorly calibrated for estimator variables that people know less about.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 5218}

The mixtures were prepared at various weight ratios of 100PH, 75PH + 25G and 50PH + 50G. A suitable selection of the printable ink was made based on the preliminary screening steps of manual filament drop test and layer stacking by 3D printing. Printing of the common features such as hexagon and square grids helped evaluating shape fidelity of the chosen ink. Although 50PH + 50G blend was found meeting most of the criteria for an ideal 3D printable ink, rheological and mechanical characterizations have been performed for all the ratios of polymeric blends. This study documents the correlation between various factors of rheology that should be taken into account while categorizing any biomaterial as a printable ink. Yield stress was measured as 18.59 +/- 4.21 Pa, 268.74 +/- 13.56 Pa and 109.16 +/- 9.85 Pa for 50PH + 50G, 75PH + 25G and 100PH, respectively. Similarly, consistency index (K) and flow index (n) were calculated using the power law equation and found as 49.303 +/- 4.17, 530.59 +/- 10.92, 291.82 +/- 10.53 and 0.275 +/- 0.04, 0.05 +/- 0.005, 0.284 +/- 0.04 for 50PH + 50G, 75PH + 25G and 100PH, respectively.

Counting chamber depth and loading method, can profoundly influence motility and concentration estimates, thereby undermining the validity and accuracy of CASA. To contribute toward standardized sperm analysis, this study compared different commercially available capillary-filled slides including 10 and 20 mu m deep Leja slides (Leja10 and Leja20); 10, 16 and 20 mu m deep CellVision slides (CV10, CV16 and CV20); and drop-loaded slides including slide and coverslip (SCS) with a depth of 20.1 mu m and the Makler chamber with a depth of 10 mu m for sperm analysis when using CASA. The Sperm Class Analyzer (SCA) CASA system was used to assess concentration, motility, and detailed kinematic parameters of 20 normozoospermic human samples using the different chamber slides. Results were evaluated by the repeated measures ANOVA and Intraclass correlation coefficients. The Makler chamber showed significantly (P < 0.05) higher concentrations than other slides. However, there was no significant difference in the percentage of sperm in different motility groups among the slides. CV10, Leja10 and Makler showed significantly higher curvilinear-, average path- and straight-line velocity (VCL, VAP, VSL) values than other slides. In conclusion, despite the objectiveness of the assessments by CASA systems, there are still some discrepancies in the results of sperm concentration, motility and other kinematic parameters when using different commercially available slides. The possible negative influence of the sperm quality misdiagnosis on the selection of treatment strategy in a clinical setting, emphasizes the need for further standardization and quality control of the commercially available chamber slides for use with CASA. Furthermore, this study found more consistent results for capillary-filled chambers compared to drop-loaded slides, suggesting a superior method when using CASA.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 5227}

Others point to the existence of a \"victim narrative\" and suggest that circulating horror stories are unrepresentative of ethnographers' experiences, or argue that ethnographers' complaints disguise a self-interested and un-reflexive desire to avoid oversight. A final explanation suggests that resistance is restricted to an ageing cohort of scholars raised in an era before ethics review became the norm. Drawing on two surveys of ethnographers conducted a decade apart, we conclude that the most convincing explanation for the longstanding \"chorus of complaint\" is the fundamental epistemological conflict between ethnographic methods and the way ethics review is currently constituted.

However, high dose-dependent induced toxicity to tissues, non-selectivity, and radioresistance greatly limit the application of RT. Herein, an oxygen-enriched X-ray nanoprocessor Hb@Hf-Ce6 nanoparticle is developed for improving the therapeutic effect of RT-radiodynamic therapy (RDT), enhancing modulation of hypoxia tumor microenvironment (TME) and promoting antitumor immune response in combination with programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint blockade. All functional molecules are integrated into the nanoparticle based on metal-phenolic coordination, wherein one high-Z radiosensitizer (hafnium, Hf) coordinated with chlorin e6 (Ce6) modified polyphenols and a promising oxygen carrier (hemoglobin, Hb) is encapsulated for modulation of oxygen balance in the hypoxia TME. Specifically, under single X-ray irradiation, radioluminescence excited by Hf can activate photosensitizer Ce6 for ROS generation by RDT. Therefore, this combinatory strategy induces comprehensive antitumor immune response for cancer eradication and metastasis inhibition.

The present study aimed to investigate whether co-infection with herpetic viruses may contribute to the pathogenesis of AORRP. Design Prospective case-control study conducted from January 2018 to November 2019. Settings Tertiary referral centre. Participants Eighteen consecutive patients with AORRP and 18 adults with healthy laryngeal mucosa (control group) undergoing surgery. Main outcome measures Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2, human herpesvirus 6, varicella zoster virus and HPV (including genotyping) were detected in biopsies of papilloma or healthy mucosa using real-time polymerase chain reaction and reverse line blot.

The unchanging under-representation of women in executive boards confirms the need to analyse factors maintaining gender inequality in Polish sports federations. 24 individual in-depth interviews were conducted with persons occupying leadership positions in order to explore the recruitment and selection process for board members in Polish sports federations. The results show significant discrepancies between women and men in terms of perceiving barriers preventing existence of more diverse and gender-balanced boards. Women indicated that the selection policy significantly reduced women's possibilities to hold positions in boards. The selection is preceded by appointing candidates by members of federations. Lack of trust towards women in sport and old boys' network are the causes of not nominating them, according to the female respondents. The studied male respondents did not agree with these opinions. They pointed out lack of willingness and proper commitment that results in women not being elected. They did not identify gender as a significant feature in the functioning of an organisation.

Specifically, the study aims to provide an adequate structural interpretation of the readings, which infers the structural health. It is especially relevant for RC structures, that are designed to be cracked during their service life. To meet this goal the study correlates damage induced by cracks and curvature computed from strains to analyze 2D RC structures characterised by directional strains, and moment redistribution. The study also considered the installation possibilities and the limited and thus averaged strain data. To exclusively correlate changes in curvatures, by means of curvature index factors, and residual bending stiffness distribution, the study proposed an iterative identification algorithm. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the algorithm by numerical simulations of strain measurements and considers the various limitations of the adopted strain measurements along large 2D RC structures. It is presented that the procedure succeeds in localising the damaged regions and provides less accurate, but still contributive, assessment of their severity. Thus, the proposed method can support engineers in decision making regarding the structural health of the structure.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 5275}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Background Deficits in perception and production of vocal pitch are often observed in people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but the neural basis of these deficits is unknown. In magnetoencephalogram (MEG), spectrally complex periodic sounds trigger two continuous neural responses-the auditory steady state response (ASSR) and the sustained field (SF). It has been shown that the SF in neurotypical individuals is associated with low-level analysis of pitch in the 'pitch processing center' of the Heschl's gyrus. Therefore, alternations in this auditory response may reflect atypical processing of vocal pitch. The SF, however, has never been studied in people with ASD. Methods We used MEG and individual brain models to investigate the ASSR and SF evoked by monaural 40 Hz click trains in boys with ASD (N = 35) and neurotypical (NT) boys (N = 35) aged 7-12-years. Results In agreement with the previous research in adults, the cortical sources of the SF in children were located in the left and right Heschl's gyri, anterolateral to those of the ASSR. In both groups, the SF and ASSR dominated in the right hemisphere and were higher in the hemisphere contralateral to the stimulated ear. The ASSR increased with age in both NT and ASD children and did not differ between the groups. The SF amplitude did not significantly change between the ages of 7 and 12 years. It was moderately attenuated in both hemispheres and was markedly delayed and displaced in the left hemisphere in boys with ASD. The SF delay in participants with ASD was present irrespective of their intelligence level and severity of autism symptoms. Limitations We did not test the language abilities of our participants. Therefore, the link between SF and processing of vocal pitch in children with ASD remains speculative. Conclusion Children with ASD demonstrate atypical processing of spectrally complex periodic sound at the level of the core auditory cortex of the left-hemisphere. The observed neural deficit may contribute to speech perception difficulties experienced by children with ASD, including their poor perception and production of linguistic prosody.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 5277}

(2) He holds that any grouping of the sciences in a succession gives a radically wrong idea of their genesis and their interdependence; no true filiation exists; no science develops itself in isolation; no one is independent, either logically or historically. M. Littre, by far the most eminent of the scientific followers of Comte, concedes a certain force to Mr. Spencer's objections, and makes certain secondary modifications in the hierarchy in consequence, while still cherishing his faith in the Comtist theory of the sciences. Mr. Mill, while admitting the objections as good, if Comte's arrangement pretended to be the only one possible, still holds that arrangement as tenable for the purpose with which it was devised.", "group": "PHIL", "id": 5287}

To determine the clinical relevance of this radiological variant, we included 235 patients (cirrhosis in 92.3%, classified Child-Pugh A in 97%) from a prospective database on percutaneous thermal ablation for <3 cm HCC. Among these patients, 52 (22.1%) had at least one steatotic HCC nodule. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis was more frequent in patients with than without steatotic HCC (P = 0.057), whereas body mass index, diabetes mellitus, liver steatosis, and liver fat content did not differ between groups. Liver disease was less advanced in patients with than without steatotic HCC: lower total bilirubin (-2.1 mu mol/L; P = 0.035), higher albumin (+0.8 g/L; P = 0.035), and lower Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score (-0.8; P = 0.014). Tumor phenotype was less aggressive in patients with steatotic HCC: lower alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) concentration (P = 0.019), less frequent AFP > 100 ng/mL (P = 0.045), and multifocality (P = 0.015). During the follow-up (median: 28.3 months), overall mortality (3.8% vs. 23.5%; P = 0.001) and HCC-specific mortality (0.0% vs. 14.2%; P = 0.002) rates were lower in patients with steatotic HCC. Early (<2 years) recurrence was also less frequent (32.7% vs. 49.2%; P = 0.041). The mean time to intrahepatic distant recurrence (16.4 vs. 9 months, P = 0.006) and the median time to recurrence and recurrence-free survival (32.4 vs. 18.6 months, P = 0.024 and 30.4 vs. 16.4 months, P = 0.018) were longer in patients with steatotic versus nonsteatotic HCC. The 3-year overall survival was 94.4% and 70.9% in steatotic and nonsteatotic HCC (P = 0.008). In multivariate analysis, steatotic HCC (hazard ratio = 0.12; P = 0.039) and AFP (HR=1.002; P < 0.001) independently predicted overall survival.

Improving data transfer efficiency, scalability, and survivability in the fragile network environment and constrained resources in IoT systems is always a fundamental issues. In this paper, we present a novel message routing algorithm that optimizes IoT data transfers in a resource constrained and fragile network environment in publish-subscribe model. The proposed algorithm can adapt the dynamical network topology of continuously changing IoT devices with the rerouting method. We also present a rerouting algorithm in Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) to take over the topic-based session flows with a controller when a broker crashed down. Data can still be communicated by another broker with rerouting mechanism. Higher availability in IoT can be achieved with our proposed model. Through demonstrated efficiency of our algorithms about message routing and dynamically adapting the continually changing device and network topology, IoT systems can gain scalability and survivability. We have evaluated our algorithms with open source Eclipse Mosquitto. With the extensive experiments and simulations performed in Mosquitto, the results show that our algorithms perform optimally. The proposed algorithms can be widely used in IoT systems with publish-subscribe model. Furthermore, the algorithms can also be adopted in other protocols such as Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP).", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 5293}

Objective: To evaluate middle ear function in residents of high-altitude areas in comparison to sea-level participants. Design: Prospective observational study. Setting: All experiments were performed by experienced audiologists with a calibrated tympanometry machine. Participants: Young adults between the age of 17 and 23 were recruited. Seventy-five participants from Shanghai (altitude 4 m) and 133 participants from the Shigatse area (altitude 4,040 m) were recruited. Any participant with any otological disorder was excluded. Main Outcome Measure: Four indexes of the tympanogram were evaluated in the two groups from different altitudes. Results: Our results showed that the peak of static compliance for the participants in Shigatse was smaller, but the absolute compliance of tympanic membrane remained the same. Similarly, the ear canal volume (ECV) from tympanometry was also affected by the elevated altitude in Tibet. In addition, the tympanometric peak pressure was decreased in high-altitude residents, which suggests a slightly declined function of the Eustachian tube at lower barometric pressure. However, no difference was found in the tympanometric width (TW). Conclusion: Our results indicate that tympanograms were affected by decreased atmospheric pressure at high altitude. Therefore, other than pressure-related indexes, TW is better for evaluating the function of the middle ear in high-altitude regions.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 5300}

Endogenous and exogenous substances might alter the structure and behavior of hyalocytes that can contribute to the pathogenesis of some ocular diseases. Obtaining primary cultures of human hyalocytes could help understand the role of these cells in response to different treatments. Methods: Hyalocytes were isolated from eyes of 54 patient volunteers subjected to vitrectomy for different clinical reasons. By testing different matrices and growth media, we reproducibly generated primary cultures of hyalocytes that we characterized morphologically and biologically, basally and upon treatment with several agents (basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta), platelet-derived growth factor subunit-BB (PDGF-BB), ascorbic acid, dexamethasone, and hydrogen peroxide). Results: We were able to generate primary cultures from vitreous human samples, growing the cells on collagen-coated plates in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum; primary cells expressed the hyalocyte markers. Specific cytoskeletal modifications were observed upon treatment with bFGF, TGF-beta, PDGF-BB, ascorbic acid, dexamethasone, and hydrogen peroxide. Only bFGF was able to promote cell growth and hyaluronic acid production. Conclusions: We describe for the first time the generation and the characterization of primary cultures of human hyalocytes from living donors. Although human hyalocytes share some characteristics with animal hyalocytes, human hyalocytes have their own features typical of the species, confirming how important human experimental models are for investigating human pathologies and their treatments.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 5301}

Cognitive test scores were combined by factor analysis into 4 cognitive domains, whose mean was defined as the continuous cognitive index (CCI). Postoperative global cognitive change was defined by CCI change from before to after surgery, with negative CCI change indicating worsened postoperative global cognition and vice versa. Results: Lower global cognition before surgery was associated with greater baseline depression severity (Spearman's r = -0.30, p = 0.002) and baseline anxiety severity (Spearman's r = -0.25, p = 0.010), and these associations were similar following surgery (r = -0.36, p < 0.001; r = -0.26, p = 0.008, respectively).

The aim of this study was to demonstrate the utility of using pharmacometric-based clinical trial simulation (CTS) to generate prior distributions for use in Bayesian decision-theoretic trial design. The methods consisted of four principal stages: a CTS to predict the distribution of treatment response for a range of trial designs; Bayesian updating for a proposed sample size; a pharmacoeconomic model to represent the perspective of a reimbursement authority in which price is contingent on trial outcome; and a model of the pharmaceutical company return on investment linking drug prices to sales revenue. We used a case study of febuxostat versus allopurinol for the treatment of hyperuricemia in patients with gout. Trial design scenarios studied included alternative treatment doses, inclusion criteria, input uncertainty, and sample size. Optimal trial sample sizes varied depending on the uncertainty of model inputs, trial inclusion criteria, and treatment doses.

Deleterious impact of psychological distress on medical adherence has been recognized; however, few studies examined the influence of change in psychological distress on attenuation in adherence. This study investigated whether three common manifestations of distress (depression, anxiety, and perceived stress) and their changes predicted decline in medical adherence among CHD patient over 9 months. Design A three-wave longitudinal study. Methods Participants were 255 CHD patients with a mean age of 63 years. Psychological distress, medication adherence, and specific treatment adherence were assessed at baseline, 3 months, and 9 months. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to examine the influences of psychological distress on medical adherence over 9 months. All models were adjusted for baseline medication or specific adherence, demographic, and medical covariates. Results Baseline depression and its changes over time significantly predicted greater decline in both medication adherence (beta s = .15-.20, ps < .05) and specific adherence (beta s = -.21 to -.15, ps < .05). Anxiety showed a similar trend. For perceived stress, baseline and its change significantly predicted specific adherence over 9 months (beta s = -.30 to -.23, ps < .01), but did not predict medication adherence at 3 and 9 months.

{"label": "NEG", "text": "2D nanomaterials have long been considered for development of high permeability membranes. However, current processes have yet to yield a viable membrane for practical use due to the lack of scalability and substantial performance improvements over existing membranes. Herein, an ultrathin graphene oxide (GO) membrane with a permeability of 1562 mL h(-1) mmHg(-1) m(-2), two orders of magnitude higher than the existing nanofiltration membranes, and a tight molecular weight cut-off is presented. To build such a membrane, a new process involving self-assembly and optimization of GO nanoplatelet physicochemical properties is developed. The process produces a highly organized mosaic of nanoplatelets enabling ultra-high permeability and selectivity. An adjustable molecular interlinker between the layers enables absolute nanometer-scale size cut-offs. These characteristics promise significant improvements to many nanoparticle and biological separation applications. In this work, the performance of the membrane in blood dialysis scenarios is evaluated. Urea and cytochrome-c sieving coefficients of 0.5 and 0.4 are achieved while retaining 99% of albumin.

Computational analysis performed upon the stable geometry of ABAQ molecule using density functional theory strongly supports the experimental findings with a significant chemical background. The non-linear behavior of the title compound is determined by investigating various non-linear optical (NLO) parameters of electric dipole moment, polarizability, and hyperpolarizability.

Although the tongue plays an important role in mastication, bilateral tongue function during mastication has not been clarified yet. Objective To investigate the effect of food properties on posterior tongue activity and coordination of muscles bilaterally by electromyography (EMG). Methods Twenty healthy adults (10 males and 10 females; mean age 28 years; range: 22-33 years) participated in this study. Three test foods, gummy jelly (hard food), sponge cake (soft food requiring crushing), and mashed potatoes (soft food not requiring crushing), were used. Bilateral masseter N-EMG (surface electromyography for measuring the muscle activity of posterior tongue) and submental EMG were carried out while the participants chewed three test foods. The participants were instructed to masticate three test foods only on the right side and only on the left side unilaterally. Results In the case of gummy jelly, N-EMG activity on the mastication side was significantly larger than that on the non-mastication side (P < .01). Regarding temporal relationship between the masseter and N-EMG activity, in the case of gummy jelly, the percentage of cases where the N-EMG peak was observed during masseter muscle EMG bursts was significantly higher than those for sponge cake and mashed potatoes (P < .01).

Prior research has demonstrated that a simple cancer opioid risk score might help identify to patients with cancer at the time of diagnosis with a high likelihood of long-term posttreatment opioid use. This current project validates this cancer opioid risk score in a generalizable, population-based cohort of elderly cancer survivors. Methods This study identified 44,932 Medicare beneficiaries with cancer who had received local therapy. Longitudinal opioid use was ascertained from Medicare Part D data. A risk score was calculated for each patient, and patients were categorized into low-, moderate-, and high-risk groups on the basis of the predicted probability of persistent opioid use. Model discrimination was assessed with receiver operating characteristic curves. Results In the study cohort, 5.2% of the patients were chronic opioid users 1 to 2 years after the initiation of cancer treatment. The majority of the patients (64%) were at low risk and had a 1.2% probability of long-term opioid use. Moderate-risk patients (33% of the cohort) had a 5.6% probability of long-term opioid use. High-risk patients (3.5% of the cohort) had a 75% probability of long-term opioid use. The opioid risk score had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.869. Conclusions This study found that a cancer opioid risk score could accurately identify individuals with a high likelihood of long-term opioid use in a large, generalizable cohort of cancer survivors. Future research should focus on the implementation of these scores into clinical practice and how this could affect prescriber behavior and patient outcomes.

We hypothesize that, due to its environmental niche, the diploid accession would show better adaptation to combined waterlogging-saline stress compared to the tetraploid L. corniculatus. Plants were evaluated under control conditions, waterlogging, salinity and a combined waterlogging-saline treatment for 33 days. Shoot and root growth were assessed, together with chlorophyll fluorescence and gas exchange measurements. Results showed that salinity and waterlogging effects were more severe for the tetraploid accession, with a larger effect being observed under the combined stress condition. Concentrations of Na+, Cl- and K+ were measured in apical and basal leaves, and in roots. A larger accumulation of Na+ and Cl- was observed under both saline and combined stress treatments for the tetraploid L. corniculatus, for which ion toxicity effects were evident. The expression of CLC gene, coding for a Cl- transporter, was only increased in diploid L. corniculatus plants in response to the combined stress condition, suggesting that ion compartmentalization mechanisms were induced in this accession.

Depending on the shape and timing of these cycles, the academic-practitioner gap is either large or small. Our conceptual analysis based on diffusion theory reveals an undiscussed yet important cause of the academic-practitioner gap, namely, divergent diffusion cycles for academia and practice.

However, additional genetic determinants of FVIII PK are largely unknown. Objectives The contribution of VWF clearance, VWF-FVIII-binding activity, and genetic variants in VWF clearance receptors to FVIII PK in adult patients were assessed. Methods FVIII PK assessment was performed in 44 adult subjects (age 18-61 years) with moderate or severe hemophilia A. VWF:Ag, VWF propeptide (VWFpp), VWFpp/VWF:Ag, and VWF:FVIII binding activity were measured. The VWF modifying loci CLEC4M, SCARA5, STAB2, and ABO, and the D ' D3 FVIII-binding region of the VWF gene were genotyped. Results VWF:Ag, VWFpp, and VWF:FVIIIB positively correlated with FVIII half-life and negatively correlated with FVIII clearance. VWFpp/VWF:Ag negatively correlated with FVIII half-life and positively correlated with FVIII clearance. The correlation between VWFpp/VWF:Ag and FVIII half-life was stronger for type non-O patients than for type O patients, suggesting that slower VWF clearance increases FVIII half-life. Patients heterozygous for the CLEC4M rs868875 variant had increased FVIII clearance when compared with individuals homozygous for the reference allele. The CLEC4M variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) alleles were also associated with the rate of FVIII clearance. When compared with the quartile of patients with the fastest FVIII clearance, the quartile of patients with the slowest FVIII clearance had a decreased frequency of the CLEC4M 5-VNTR.

However, there is a lack of knowledge about the antecedents of knowledge integration. This study aims to examine how social capital at different levels and their interaction influences knowledge integration in IDR teams. Specifically, this study explores the moderating role of team social capital in the relationship between individual social capital and knowledge integration. Design/methodology/approach A survey on 346 individuals from 46 IDR teams in a research university in China is conducted. A multilevel analysis of the hierarchical linear model is used to process the sociometric data. Findings Results reveal that team social capital interacts with individual social capital by influencing knowledge integration. At the individual level, tie strength and structural equivalence have a positive influence on knowledge integration. There is an inverted U-shaped relationship between betweenness centrality and knowledge integration. Furthermore, team cohesion negatively moderates the positive effect of tie strength and structural equivalence on knowledge integration. No support is found for the moderating role of team cohesion on the effect of betweenness centrality. Originality/value First, different from previous research on social capital at single levels, this study links the individual-level and the team-level views to explore the effects of social capital on knowledge integration.

Finally, if there be still persons who are not sufficiently persuaded of the existence of God and of the soul, by the reasons I have adduced, I am desirous that they should know that all the other propositions, of the truth of which they deem themselves perhaps more assured, as that we have a body, and that there exist stars and an earth, and such like, are less certain; for, although we have a moral assurance of these things, which is so strong that there is an appearance of extravagance in doubting of their existence, yet at the same time no one, unless his intellect is impaired, can deny, when the question relates to a metaphysical certitude, that there is sufficient reason to exclude entire assurance, in the observation that when asleep we can in the same way imagine ourselves possessed of another body and that we see other stars and another earth, when there is nothing of the kind.

The mission task conducted by a k/n-PAMS involves multiple consecutive phases; the mission is successful as long as the task is successful in any of the phases. Due to factors, such as scheduled maintenance, location changes in task execution during different phases, and resource sharing with other tasks, the total number of available components n for the considered mission task and the required number of working components k may change from phase to phase. In addition, due to varying load and working environments, component failure time distributions are also phase dependent. This paper proposes an analytical modeling approach based on multivalued decision diagrams (MDDs) for assessing reliability of the considered k/n-PAMS. The approach encompasses a new and fast MDD model generation algorithm that considers behaviors of all the mission phases simultaneously based on node labeling. As demonstrated through empirical studies on k/n-PAMSs with different sizes (different numbers of phases and different numbers of system components), the proposed algorithm is more efficient than the traditional phase-by-phase model generation method.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 5413}

In this study, S. jambos and other trees in the Myrtales were examined on three Hawaiian Islands for the presence of Cryphonectriaceae. Bark samples with fruiting bodies were collected from infected trees and fungi were isolated directly from these structures. Pure cultures were produced and the fungi were identified using DNA sequence data for the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, part of the beta-tubulin (BT1) gene and the transcription elongation factor-1 alpha (TEF1) gene. Five species in three genera of Cryphonectriaceae were identified from Myrtaceae tree samples. These included Chrysoporthe deuterocubensis, Microthia havanensis and three previously-unknown taxa described here as Celoporthe hauoliensis sp. nov., Cel. hawaiiensis sp. nov. and Cel. paradisiaca sp. nov.

Design/methodology/approach First, the authors applied an improved version of the stochastic frontier model to estimate the trade efficiency scores. After that, we used the system generalized method of moment (GMM) estimator to investigate the impacts of institutional and cultural distances on ASEAN's trade efficiency. Findings The results show that the trade efficiency of ASEAN countries with the rest of the world (ROW) is moderate, ranging from 0.561 to 0.612, but shows a downward trend. This result indicates that considerable trade potential exists between ASEAN countries and ROW. Institutional and cultural distances, as well as the trade barriers, negatively affect ASEAN's trade efficiency. Efforts to reduce differences in institutions and cultures and to promote trade liberalization are vital remedies for ASEAN countries to turn potentials into actual trade performance. Originality/value This study contributes to the existing literature in three different ways. First, this is the first study on the impact of the differences between internal and external characteristics on trade efficiency, specifically, the impact of institutional and cultural distances on ASEAN's trade efficiency. Second, to obtain accurate efficiency scores, the authors use an improved version of the stochastic frontier model proposed by Karakaplan (2018), which can control the problem of endogeneity. Third, in quantifying the determinants of trade efficiency, the authors apply a system GMM estimator, which allows us to overcome the problems of endogeneity, measurement errors, and omitted variables.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 5430}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Objectives: We aimed to evaluate the histopathological characteristics of chronic gastritis in dyspeptic patients without visible mucosal lesions in different age groups and different biopsy sites. Methods: Patients who underwent upper endoscopy for the investigation of dyspepsia as the sole indication were recruited. We selected data from patients without visible mucosal lesions for the study. Gastric biopsy specimens were evaluated by Update Sydney classification according to age, Helicobacter pylori (Hp), and biopsy sites. Results: A total of 626 patients were retrospectively studied. 58.2% had histopathological features of chronic gastritis, while 41.8% had normal gastric mucosa. The prevalence of glandular atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, and Hp infection was 36.7, 19.3 and 36.6%. Complete and incomplete metaplasia was found to be 17.0 and 2.2%. The mean score of chronic inflammation, neutrophil activity, glandular atrophy, and intestinal metaplasia was significantly higher in the antrum than in the corpus. The positivity of gastritis increases with age; however, Hp positivity decreased considerably with advanced age. Concerning gastritis's topography, antral-predominant gastritis and corpus-predominant gastritis increased with age. The prevalence of glandular atrophy and intestinal metaplasia markedly increased with age, especially after age 50. Gastric atrophy and intestinal metaplasia were significantly higher in patients positive for Hp than in negative patients. Conclusion: Overall chronic gastritis is common in dyspeptic patients without visible lesions. Prevalence, grading, and severity of chronic gastritis increase with age and Hp infection. Temporal changes of the gastric mucosa are caused by aging rather than by Hp alone.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 5432}
{"label": "NEG", "text": "Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a synaptic plasticity mechanism critical to long-term memory. LTP induced in vivo is characterized by altered transcriptional activity, including a period of upregulation of gene expression which is followed by a later dominant downregulation. This temporal shift to downregulated gene expression is predicted to be partly mediated by epigenetic inhibitors of gene expression, such as histone deacetylases (HDACs). Further, pharmacological inhibitors of HDAC activity have previously been shown to enhance LTP persistence in vitro. To explore the contribution of HDACs to the persistence of LTP in vivo, we examined HDAC1 and HDAC2 activity over a 24 hr period following unilateral LTP induction in the dentate gyrus of freely moving rats. Surprisingly, we found significant changes in HDAC1 and HDAC2 activity in both the stimulated as well as the unstimulated hemispheres, with the largest increase in activity occurring bilaterally, 20 min after LTP stimulation. During this time point of heightened activity, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that both HDAC1 and HDAC2 were enriched at distinct sets of genes within each hemispheres. Further, the HDAC inhibitor Trichostatin A enhanced an intermediate phase of LTP lasting days, which has not previously been associated with altered transcription. The inhibitor had no effect on the persistence of LTP lasting weeks. Together, these data suggest that HDAC activity early after the induction of LTP may negatively regulate plasticity-related gene expression that is involved in the initial stabilization of LTP, but not its long-term maintenance.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 5433}
{"label": "NEG", "text": "Stress is a risk factor for many skin conditions, but the cellular and molecular mechanisms of its impacts have only begun to be revealed. In mice, acute stress induces loss of melanocyte stem cells (MeSCs) and premature hair greying. Our previous work demonstrated that the loss of MeSCs upon acute stress is caused by the hyperactivation of the sympathetic nervous system. Stress also induces the secretion of stress hormones from the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis; however, whether stress hormones are involved in the hair greying process has not been fully examined. In particular, the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) is released from the pituitary glands upon stress. ACTH is a ligand for the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R), which plays critical roles in regulating MeSC migration and skin pigmentation. We investigated whether the MC1R pathway is required for the stress-induced hair greying. We confirmed that MC1R is the major melanocortin receptor expressed in MeSCs. However, induction of acute stress via resiniferatoxin (RTX) injection still leads to hair greying in Mc1r mutant mice, suggesting that the ACTH-MC1R pathway is not a major contributor in acute stress-induced premature hair greying.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 5434}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "The emotional experience of foodwork is often considered along a continuum, where pleasure exists in opposition to labor, and where inequalities restrict pleasure. Analyzing qualitative interviews, recall conversations and cooking observations with 34 primary cooks in families, this article explores how diverse parents experience pleasure through family foodwork. Doing so reveals five conditions facilitating pleasure: time, choice, aesthetic freedom, connection, and appreciation. It then analyzes how access to these conditions is shaped by class inequalities, while being attentive to intersections with gender and race/ethnicity. This analysis reveals how socio-economic inequalities fashion negative emotional relationships to foodwork by imposing disproportionate stressors on low-income home cooks, but do not necessarily predict cooking pleasure. Through examining intersections between the sensory and material aspects of foodwork, this article furthers theoretical understanding into how foodwork reinforces gendered, racialized, and classed oppression, while simultaneously identifying how agency and empowerment operate through cooking pleasure for low-income groups.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 5459}

The medieval pilgrimage routes followed by the Poles, as well as the length of the route, pilgrimage duration, dynamism, and versatility of the pilgrimage space were analyzed. The conclusions indicate that the medieval pilgrims from Poland, heading for St. James' tomb, covered the longest section of the pilgrimage road along the East-West axis in Europe. The growing number of contemporary Polish citizens following the Way of St. James is primarily the result of the revival of pilgrimage through medieval pilgrimage routes, the revival of the St. James' cult in many Polish parishes, the activities of numerous St. James' organizations and fraternities, the promotion of the Way, and the \"fashion\" for Camino de Santiago.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 5465}

As the environment changes, decision makers will exchange their views and influence each other. In addition, multiple decision makers are not always knowledgeable and sometimes express their preferences about suppliers using fuzzy numbers. To meet the different evaluation requirements of decision makers and analyze the influence of time factors and opinion interaction between decision makers, this paper develops a group decision making approach considering multi-period fuzzy information and opinion interaction of decision makers for supplier selection. In this approach, decision makers provide their preferences in multiple periods using generalised fuzzy numbers and the weights of different periods are determined by a mathematical programming method. The effects of opinion interaction are considered by assigning various weights to different decision makers. Fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method is used to rank potential suppliers. The results of a supplier selection example show the proposed approach can select suitable suppliers by considering multi-period fuzzy information and opinion interaction.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 5471}

Materials and Methods. In this experimental study, adult Naval Medical Research Institute (NMRI) mice (20-25 g) were prepared. The collagenase digestion method was used for dissecting the islets of Langerhans. H2O2 50 mu M was administered for 30 min to induce oxidative stress, with 50, 100, and 200 mu M of eugenol employed for 2 hours before the administration of H2O2. The experimental groups were divided into five groups: (control, H2O2, and H2O2+eugenol 50, 100, and 200 mu M). Finally, the islet's lipid peroxidation and antioxidants levels were measured by the ELISA assay method. Results. Malondialdehyde (MDA), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) increased in all groups when compared to the control (P<0.05). MDA diminished in H2O2+eugenol 50, 100, and 200 mu M (P<0.01) groups versus the H2O2. TAC was elevated when eugenol 50, 100, and 200 mu M was administered in oxidative stress-induced islets (P<0.001). Also, CAT increased in the H2O2+eugenol 50 (P<0.05) group in comparison with the H2O2 group. Conclusions. In conclusion, H2O2 induced oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation in the islets, and administration of eugenol recovered these alterations by raising the level of TAC and CAT, while reducing MDA as a lipid peroxidation biomarker.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 5496}

My third maxim was to endeavor always to conquer myself rather than fortune, and change my desires rather than the order of the world, and in general, accustom  myself to the persuasion that, except our own thoughts, there is nothing absolutely in our power; so that when we have done our best in things external to us, all wherein we fail of success is to be held, as regards us, absolutely impossible:  and this single principle seemed to me sufficient to prevent me from desiring for the future anything which I could not obtain, and thus render me contented; for since our will naturally seeks those objects alone which the understanding represents as in some way possible of attainment, it is plain, that if we consider all external goods as equally beyond our power, we shall no more regret the absence of such goods as seem due to our birth, when deprived of them without any fault of ours,  than our not possessing the kingdoms of China or Mexico, and thus making, so to speak, a virtue of necessity, we shall no more desire health in disease, or freedom in imprisonment, than we now do bodies incorruptible as diamonds, or the wings of birds to fly with. But I confess there is need of prolonged discipline and frequently repeated meditation to accustom the mind to view all objects in this light; and I believe that in this chiefly consisted the secret of the power of such philosophers as in former times were enabled to rise superior to the influence of fortune, and, amid suffering and poverty, enjoy a happiness which their gods might have envied. For, occupied incessantly with the consideration of the limits prescribed to their power by nature, they became so entirely convinced that nothing was at their disposal except their own thoughts, that this conviction was of itself sufficient to prevent their entertaining any desire of other objects; and over their thoughts they acquired a sway so absolute, that they had some ground on this account for esteeming themselves more rich and more powerful, more free and more happy, than other men who, whatever be the favors heaped on them by nature and fortune, if destitute of this philosophy, can never command the realization of all their desires.

Twenty-five volatile compounds were identified, which made up 92.07% of the total essential oil content. The essential oil yield was 1.06% and the most abundant compounds were 1.8-cineole (45.01%), alpha-caryophyllene (7.54%), germacradienol (6.13%), limonene (4.69%), alpha-pinene (3.04%), and germacrene D (3.14%). The antifungal activity of the obtained essential oil was tested against seven fungal strains: Aspergillus clavatus, A. niger, Chaetomium globosum, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Myrothecium verrucaria, Penicillium citrinum, and Trichoderma viride. The results indicated that essential oil from L. nobilis flowers exhibited significant antifungal activity against the tested fungal strains with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 0.05 to 0.46 mg/mL. The essential oil of L. nobilis also exhibited strong total antioxidant capacity (TAC) as indicated by its ability to scavenge free radical DPPH.

By fixing the poly(d,l-lactide) (PDLLA) block length (1 kg mol(-1)) and changing the poly(d-lactide) (PDLA) block length (M-n,M-PDLA = 0, 0.5, 1.1, 1.3, 1.8 and 2.6 kg mol(-1)), the crystallization and alkaline degradation of the PLLA/4-DL-D blends were investigated. The four-armed PDLLA core of the copolymer inhibited the crystallization of PLLA, while the outer PDLA block could affect the crystallization differently when its length changed. If M-n,M-PDLA was 0 or 0.5 kg mol(-1), the crystallization of PLLA in the PLLA/4-DL-D blend was retarded markedly and the degradation rate of the blend films was much faster than that of neat PLLA film. Interestingly, when M-n,M-PDLA was 1.1 kg mol(-1) or higher, stereocomplex (SC) crystallites with different morphologies were formed, and the degradation rate of the PLLA/4-DL-D blend decreased gradually with increasing M-n,M-PDLA. In the PLLA/4-DL-D1.1 blend, the SC crystallites acted as nucleators for PLLA homocrystallites, while in the PLLA/4-DL-D1.3 blend, small isolated SC crystallites were observed inside the PLLA homospherulites. When M-n,M-PDLA was 1.8 or 2.6 kg mol(-1), a network structure of SC crystallites was formed and the degradation resistance of the films was markedly enhanced. A possible isothermal crystallization mechanism was proposed for the PLLA/4-DL-D blends, and the relationship between the crystallization state and degradation behavior was explored.

Expanded surface area reduced electrode/electrolyte interface charge-transfer resistance and showed excellent rate capability (79 % of initial capacity at 100 C-rate). However, poor cyclability was obtained. At elevated temperatures, nuclei growth and dehydration occurred, and thus highly crystalline large particles were formed. In turn, NiHCF delivered excellent capacity of 76 mAh g(-1) at 1 C-rate but exhibited inferior rate performance because of longer diffusional path.

In particular, the study of tropical plant families has been compromised because they often rely on highly degraded DNA obtained from herbarium specimens. One such example is the pantropical Ochnaceae, which comprises 33 genera and approximately 550 species, occurring mostly in savannas and moist tropical forests. Here, we developed a set of baits covering about 660,000 bp from 275 nuclear genes used for the targeted enrichment based on all but one genus and more than 250 species. Using this novel dataset, we resolved the phylogenetic backbone of Ochnaceae, including that of Ochninae, and we established new relationships. Most importantly, our findings highlight that the neotropical and palaeotropical taxa of Sauvagesia form independent clades, requiring the re-erection of formerly separate genera. Ouratea and Ochna (both Ochninae), by far the most species-rich genera and represented by 120 and 41 species, respectively, came out as monophyletic. In contrast, the third-most species-rich genus, Campylospermum, is polyphyletic in two distinct clades. Ouratea, the only neotropical genus of Ochninae, was sister to the five palaeotropical genera of this subtribe.

The conformational changes in the protein structures induced by the dye JGB have been revealed from 3 D fluorescence and circular dichroism (CD) studies. The experimental observations are supported by in silico calculations. This in depth investigation on the interactions of serum albumins with JGB may provide the fundamental information toward exploring the therapeutic efficacy of JGB as a potent drug molecule.

{"label": "NEG", "text": "The human pelvis is a complex anatomical structure that consists of the innominate bones, sacrum and coccyx to form the pelvic ring. Even though considered to be a symmetric entity, asymmetry of the pelvic ring (APR) might occur to alter its anatomy, function, or biomechanics or to impact assessment and treatment of clinical cases. APR and its assessment is complicated by the intricate anatomy of the pelvic ring. There is only limited information and understanding about APR with no established evaluation methods existing. The objective of the present study was to adopt CT-based 3D statistical modeling and analysis to assess APR within the complex anatomy of the pelvic ring. We were interested to establish a better understanding of APR with knowledge and applications transferred to human anatomy, related research, and development subjects and to clinical settings. A series of 150 routine, clinical, pelvic CT protocols of European and Asian males and females (64 +/- 15 (20-90) years old) were post-processed to compute gender- and ancestry-specific 3D statistical models of the pelvic ring. Evaluations comprised principal component analysis (PCA) that included size, shape, and asymmetry patterns and their variations to be assessed. Four different CT-based 3D statistical models of the entire pelvic ring were computed according to the gender and ancestry specific groups. PCA mainly displayed size and shape variations. Examination of additional PCA modes permitted six distinct asymmetry patterns to be identified. They were located at the sacrum, iliac crest, pelvic brim, pubic symphysis, inferior pubic ramus, and near to the acetabulum. Accordingly, the pelvic ring demonstrated not to be entirely symmetric. Assessment of its asymmetry proved to be a challenging task. Using CT-based 3D statistical modeling and PCA, we identified six distinct APRs that were located at different anatomical regions. These regions are more prone to APRs than other sites. Minor asymmetry patterns have to be distinguished from the distinct APRs. Side differences with regard to size, shape, and/or position require to be taken into account. APRs may be due different load mechanisms applied via spine or lower extremity or locally. There is a need for simpler and efficient, yet reliable methods to be routinely transferred to human anatomy, related research, and development subjects and to clinical settings.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 5613}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "The objective of this study is twofold: first, to analyze whether the daily level of energy in terms of vigor at work could explain the way in which workers psychologically detach from their work, relax, practice challenging activities, and have the feeling of having control over their leisure time when arriving home. Second, to check if the daily emotional job demands could hinder that relationship, reversing the positive effect of vigor in recovery. For this purpose, a multilevel study with a diary methodology was designed. In total, 94 nurses from various hospital and primary care centers in Madrid and Basque Country (Spain) participated in this study. They completed daily questionnaires twice a day (in the afternoon after work and at night before going to bed) for five consecutive workdays from Monday to Friday (N = 94*5 = 470). The results revealed that on days that vigor at work was high, nurses experienced more psychological detachment, relaxation, feelings of mastery, and time control at home. Moreover, on days that emotional job demands were high, vigor was more negatively related to psychological detachment and time control at home. Additionally, vigor was more positively related to all recovery experiences at home in days that emotional demands were low. Therefore, daily vigor can act as an energy resource that helps the worker to recover. However, this effect can occur in situations in which stressors are not present in high intensity. These results have clear practical implications for both health organizations and workers.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 5615}

The purpose of this paper is to comprehend the theoretical and empirical development of the tourist gaze notion and its contributions to tourism knowledge, identifying potential research directions by reviewing and analyzing articles that have defined, refined and applied the concept of the tourist gaze. Design/methodology/approach - The study identified 109 relevant research papers primarily through the Web of Science and Scopus databases. Google Scholar, ResearchGate.net and Academia.edu were used to capturing additional work not indexed in the key databases. Qualitative content analysis was used to map the evolution of the concept, distinguish between different perspectives and identify gaps in the tourist gaze literature. Findings - This \"state of the art\" paper on tourist gaze outlines Foucault's original work on gaze and power, which underpins subsequent theorization within tourism. The study identifies how the tourist gaze operates in different contexts and circumstances allowing the development of gaze theory. Importantly, the evolution of the gaze theory is presented after analyzing the knowledge gaps, the contexts in which it was used, the methodologies with which it was applied. Based on the findings, the study proposes future works of gaze with the use of technology, science, nature and social media. Originality/value - This paper is among one of the first states of the art papers in tourism literature that comprehensively analyzes the works on the tourist gaze, tracing its evolution and identifying future research directions to address gaps in existing knowledge.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 5623}

Objective To identify genetic factors underlying glycemic traits in an adolescent H/L population. Methods We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of fasting glucose (FG) and fasting insulin (FI) in H/L adolescents from the Santiago Longitudinal Study. Results We identified one novel variant positioned in the CSMD1 gene on chromosome 8 (rs77465890, effect allele frequency = 0.10) that was associated with FI (beta = -0.299, SE = 0.054, p = 2.72x10(-8)) and was only slightly attenuated after adjusting for body mass index z-scores (beta = -0.252, SE = 0.047, p = 1.03x10(-7)). We demonstrated directionally consistent, but not statistically significant results in African and Hispanic adults of the Population Architecture Using Genomics and Epidemiology Consortium. We also identified secondary signals for two FG loci after conditioning on known variants, which demonstrate allelic heterogeneity in well-known glucose loci. Conclusion Our results exemplify the importance of including populations with diverse ancestral origin and adolescent participants in GWAS of glycemic traits to uncover novel risk loci and expand our understanding of disease aetiology.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 5624}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Early intervention has been a mantra in recent debates about human capital investment. Strong theoretical models motivate this focus by predicting that investment in children is most cost-effective when they are young. The \"Heckman curve\" summarizes this idea visually (Heckman, 2006). However, hardly any reviews scrutinize this hypothesis empirically in modern welfare states such as those in Scandinavia that already invest heavily during early childhood. Any such review is ideally based on interventions conducted as randomized controlled trials (RCTs), set in the same welfare state, and comparable across ages through cost-standardized effects. This meta-analysis assembles cost-standardized effect estimates from 10 RCTs, including a total of 18 intervention arms and 30,578 participants (aged 1.5-24 years), conducted by the same research center in the Scandinavian welfare state of Denmark. These interventions show significant effects relative to their costs, despite the large baseline investment level. Interventions targeted at younger children tend to produce larger effects, consistent with the Heckman curve. However, variation in the effect size within age groups is as large as it is across age groups. This indicates that both the quality and timing of investments matter and that \"early interventions\" are not necessarily superior to later interventions.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 5626}

PLWH, who are effectively treated with an ART, are considered to be unable to transmit HIV. The standard of care is usually an antiretroviral single tablet regimen. Since 2015 the Robert Koch Institute has reported a slight decrease in the rate of recently diagnosed HIV-infections in Germany, but the proportion of late presenters (initial diagnosis in advanced stages of infection) has remained consistently high at around 32 % since 2005. HIV-infections have not been diagnosed in 10,800 PLWH so far. In comparison to the general population PLWH suffer more frequently from skin diseases. Depending on the stage of immunodeficiency, untreated PLWH develop HIV indicator diseases of the skin and the mucocutaneous membranes. Knowledge of these diseases facilitates the selection of individuals who should be offered HIV testing. Early diagnosis of HIV-infections allows early introduction of the ART, prevents the spread of HIV and reduces the mortality rates and treatment costs associated with late diagnosis. HIV is a predominantly sexually transmitted infection. Through focused sexual anamnesis and the diagnosis of HIV indicator diseases and other sexually transmitted infections, dermatovenereologists in particular may be able to identify previously undiagnosed PLWH and persons with an increased risk of HIV infection, enabling initiation of ART in the former and pre-exposure prophylaxis counseling in the latter.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 5629}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "By inserting the secondary windings of the coupled inductors in series with the primary of the built-in transformer at the middle branch, a new concept is introduced for achieving ultra large voltage gain. The secondary and tertiary windings of the built-in transformer are inserted in the voltage multiplier cell. This configuration not only extends the voltage gain and minimises the voltage stress across power MOSFETs, but also gives a more flexibility to increase the voltage gain by the turns ratios of the built-in transformer and coupled inductors. Hence, high duty cycle is avoided and low voltage switches can be adopted which reduces the conduction losses. Also, the regenerative diode in each of the phases is connected to the other phase to improve equal current sharing performance.

The mining of iron ore and the processing of iron and steel increased sharply during the 20th century and peaked at the beginning of the 21st century. Associated processes along the iron ore cycle (mining, processing, recycling, weathering) such as the massive displacement of rock, the emission of waste and pollutants, or the weathering of products resulted in long-term environmental and stratigraphic changes. Key findings link the iron ore industry to 170 gigatons of rock overburden, a global share of CO2 with 7.6%, mercury with 7.4%, and a variety of other metals, pollutants, and residues. These global changes led to physical, chemical, biological, magnetic, and sequential markers, which are used for the justification of the Anthropocene.

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Although introduced more than two decades ago, agricultural biotechnology remains contentious. New technologies bring uncertainty concerning their risks and promises and create new policy process challenges for governments assessing risks and benefits in the face of contradictory evidence. Stakeholders typically claim to have evidence to support their positions, which often focuses on risks and benefits. Using the Narrative Policy Framework (NPF), this study examines the commercialization process for a genetically modified variety of eggplant in India focusing on evidence in support of claims concerning risks and benefits in policy narratives. It examines how evidence and risk are used within policy narratives and explores possible links with setting and plot since the latest NPF research situates evidence and risk in that context. Findings indicate that stakeholders use evidence, risks, and benefits differently, often in connection with other narrative elements and strategies. Proponents de-emphasize risks and exclusively highlight benefits while opponents invoke multidimensional risk. Evidence was used to portray heroes, villains, victims, and beneficiaries and, since plot situates characters in time and space, there is some support for situating evidence within plot. Risks and benefits were employed as a narrative strategy to expand or limit the scope of the policy issue and were articulated through policy problems. Setting in policy narratives includes policy problems lending support to situating risks and benefits within setting. Findings have implications on the role of evidence and risks and benefits within policy narratives.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 5692}

Computational structure prediction methods generally leverage predefined structural features to distinguish accurate structural models from less accurate ones. This raises the question of whether it is possible to learn characteristics of accurate models directly from atomic coordinates of protein complexes, with no prior assumptions. Here we introduce a machine learning method that learns directly from the 3D positions of all atoms to identify accurate models of protein complexes, without using any precomputed physics-inspired or statistical terms. Our neural network architecture combines multiple ingredients that together enable end-to-end learning from molecular structures containing tens of thousands of atoms: a point-based representation of atoms, equivariance with respect to rotation and translation, local convolutions, and hierarchical subsampling operations. When used in combination with previously developed scoring functions, our network substantially improves the identification of accurate structural models among a large set of possible models. Our network can also be used to predict the accuracy of a given structural model in absolute terms. The architecture we present is readily applicable to other tasks involving learning on 3D structures of large atomic systems.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 5700}

In this study, we test parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) function as a vulnerability/sensitivity attribute in predicting intergenerational associations between fathers' antisociality and children's delinquency scores. We followed 207 children (ages 8-12 years at intake; 139 boys) across three annual assessments. Fathers' antisociality was measured via maternal reports on the Family Interview for Genetic Studies (FIGS). At Year 1, children's resting respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) was measured. At Years 1, 2, and 3, child delinquent behaviors were assessed using the delinquency subscale of the Youth Self-Report. At age 8, boys' delinquency scores were associated weakly with paternal antisocial behaviors. However, boys' delinquency scores increased steeply thereafter specifically for those who had fathers with higher antisocial symptoms. In addition, associations between delinquency and paternal antisociality were largest for boys with higher resting RSA. For girls, growth in delinquency was unrelated to both father antisociality and resting RSA. These findings (a) suggest moderating effects of children's age, sex, and PNS function on associations between father antisocial behavior and offspring delinquency; and (b) provide insights into differential vulnerability among children of fathers with ASPD.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 5708}

In this study, we found the anticancer activity of lotus seedpod extract (LSPE) in NSCLC cells, since LSPE treatment inhibited cell proliferation of A549 and H460 cells in a dose-dependent manner and the clonogenic activities of LSPE-treated cells were also reduced. In LSPE-treated cells, the cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and phosphorylation of H2X, were also observed, indicating the pro-apoptotic effect of LSPE. Next, we found that LPSE treatment diminished the levels of protein and mRNA of Axl, a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that transduces critical signals for cell proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis. The promoter activity of Axl was found to be dose-dependently decreased in response to LSPE treatment, implying that LSPE inhibited Axl gene expression at transcriptional level. In addition, Axl overexpression was found to decrease the effects of LSPE on inhibition of cell proliferation and colony formation as well as induction of PARP cleavage and phosphorylation of H2AX, while the same activities of LPSE were increased by knockdown of Axl gene expression, indicating that the antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effect of LSPE is inversely proportional to the protein level of Axl. Taken together, we found that the LSPE suppressed cell proliferation and induced apoptosis of NSCLC cells, which is attenuated or augmented by overexpression or RNA interference of Axl expression, respectively. Our data suggest that Axl is a novel therapeutic target of LSPE to inhibit cell proliferation and promote apoptosis in NSCLC cells. Practical applications In this study, lotus seedpod extract (LSPE) was found to have the cytotoxic and apoptosis-inducing potentials in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. LSPE downregulated the Axl expression at transcriptional level and the effects of LSPE on cell proliferation as well as apoptosis were affected by Axl protein level. Therefore, the inference of Axl-mediated intracellular signals by LSPE must be a novel approach to control NSCLC.

This study proposed a method to quantify tidal traffic patterns of shared bikes in Beijing, the capital and megacity of China, and then applied multinomial logit model to reveal main causes of these patterns.

Only three patterns exist on weekends and the tidal traffic phenomenon becomes less intensive but lasts longer. Population is the most decisive factor, which determines the density of total traffic flow. Subsequently, resident-employment ratio controls the direction of commute flows thus causing tidal traffic on weekdays, while land use diversity and factors related to leisure activities are more influential on weekends.

{"label": "NEG", "text": "This study employs panel data from the sub-Saharan Africa's Intensification (Afrint) project to examine the impacts of sustainable agricultural practices (SAPs) on crop production and hidden hunger. The dataset consists of 2368 households (4736 plots) across eight countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The study utilizes a multinomial endogenous switching regression model in the empirical estimations to account for sample selection bias caused by observed and unobserved farmer attributes. In addition, the study employed Mundlak fixed effects criteria to address plot level heterogeneity. The results show that joint adoption of SAPs improves total value of output and reduces hidden hunger, relative to adoption of SAPs in isolation. Specifically, an increase in total value of output is at most USD8,288.66/ha whiles decrease in cereal self-provisioning capacity is at most 647.69 kg per adult equivalent. The results therefore suggest that joint adoption of the SAPs should be promoted over adoption in isolation. The results also indicate that the benefits associated with adoption of SAPs, either in isolation or jointly, vary across Africa. This therefore implies that compatibility and potentials of the SAPs in various locations of Africa should be considered when promoting uptake of SAPs.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 5725}

Design: Our one-arm community-based participatory research study was designed to improve blood sugar among African Americans with Type 2 diabetes through a six-month intervention combining peer support groups and professional individual coaching. Setting: Small Southern county with large, socioeconomically diverse African American population. Methods: Study participants were recruited through churches and other community sites from 2009-2012. Clinical status was measured and surveys administered at intervention beginning and end. Retention was operationalized as completion of six-month measurement. Bivariate associations between categorical variables were assessed using Pearson's chi-square and between categorical and continuous variables using independent t-tests of means. Multiple logistic regression was conducted for retention and multiple linear regression for change in HbA1c (p<.05). Results: We enrolled a large, socioeconomically diverse African- American population (n=380 and, retention was high (85%). However, those who left the study were more likely than those retained to be uninsured (52.4% vs. 28.7%) and less likely to have education beyond high school (45.3% vs. 63.3%); their average household income per person was lower ($10,942 vs. $20,731). Multivariate analysis showed that this association between socioeconomic status and retention was mediated by higher baseline blood sugar and diabetes burden among those of lower socioeconomic status. Higher baseline blood sugar, but not SES, was associated with greater improvements in diabetes control. Conclusion: These findings indicate the importance of analyses that address socioeconomic status within racial groups as a determinant of participation in and outcomes from health interventions.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 5732}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Drawing on a study of resident attitudes toward tourism development in the Canadian Arctic, this article examines the experiences of one of the authors who was accompanied by her infant son during her fieldwork. Utilising Lo's (Sociological Perspectives 59(3):694-713, 2016) concept of 'motherhood capital', derived from the work of Pierre Bourdieu, we argue that the presence of her son, who joined her on five occasions between the age of 9 and 22 months, disrupted normal research roles and relationships. We describe how her son helped rather than hindered her acceptance into the Inuit communities where she was working. By using Bourdieusian theory to examine researcher experience, we move beyond the descriptive accounts that often dominate methodological discussions. Instead we aim to demonstrate the value of applying theory that is normally only used to examine encounters observed during fieldwork, to include analysing the researcher's access and interactions. Due to the child-centred nature of the communities and the shared common ground of parenthood, we propose that Stewart's demonstration of motherhood had the effect of dismantling several of the barriers some researchers face when entering communities for the first time. Motherhood capital facilitated her privileged access to the field and changed her perceived status from an outside researcher to an equal-status mother. This was particularly important in an indigenous context where she was always going to be seen as 'other'.

To achieve this goal, this study used a historical method that includes four stages, namely heuristics, criticism, interpretation, and historiography. Garut city has been known as a tourist destination since the Dutch colonialism and became the main residential area of Europeans living on the island due to the existence of plantations in the South Garut region. These conditions make Garut City an urban area that has special features compared to other urban areas in Garut Regency. This study aims at addressing the following question: 1) How does the population influence the physical changes (morphology) of Garut City? 2) How was the railroad construction in Garut City during the Dutch colonial period? And 3) How is the influence of cosmology on the spatial layout of Garut City? The purpose of this study is to analyze the effect of population growth on the physical changes (morphology) of Garut city. The study seeks to explain the road traffic of Garut City and the factors that influenced spatial planning. The results showed that Kota Intan was the early name for Garut City, the center of government, economy, education, social, and culture of Garut Regency.

Results: More than half the 59 respondents reported worse mental health and lower physical activity during the pandemic. The preferred format for a physical activity program was one-on-one exercise instruction in-person in a park. Program components endorsed as helpful included incentivization, provision of exercise equipment and fitness devices, and daily exercise programs.

We conducted a retrospective study of mechanically ventilated OP-poisoned patients admitted to the ICU of Poison Control Center of Ain Shams, Cairo, Egypt, starting from January 2019 to December 2019. Weaning was considered successful if the patient succeeded in the first spontaneous breathing trial of weaning and did not need reinstitution of MV. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to identify factors associated with time to successful weaning in the studied patients. A total of 55 patients were enrolled in the study. Thirty-eight patients were weaned successfully. Lower initial red cell distribution width (RDW) levels [adjusted hazard ratio (HR), 0.299, 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.184-0.486)] and lower initial doses of atropine [adjusted HR, 0.97, 95% CI (0.935-0.999)] were independently associated with shorter time to achieve successful weaning. Successfully weaned patients had significantly longer hospital LOS (p = 0.019) and no reported in-hospital mortality (p < 0.001) compared with patients who failed to wean. We concluded that initial RDW and initial doses of atropine were found to be the strongest factors associated with time to successful weaning in mechanically ventilated OP-poisoned patients.

Methods: Data came from the 2012 and 2019 National Mental Health Services Survey (N-MHSS) and the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS). Using Pearson chi(2) and Fisher's exact tests, we compared the numbers/proportions of older-adult programs in 2012 and 2019 and examined differences between facilities with or without an older-adult program in 2019. Results: From 2012 to 2019, the percent of all mental health and substance use service facilities for adults that had a dedicated/tailored program for older adults increased significantly, from 20.7% to 28.9% for mental health facilities and from 7.1% to 24.8% for substance use facilities, with 101 mental health facilities and 53 substance use facilities serving older adults exclusively in 2019. Compared to facilities without an older-adult program, higher percentages of facilities with such a program offered treatment for co-occurring mental and substance use disorders and supplemental health and social care services. Conclusions: Given the rapidly aging society, more accessible and affordable programs dedicated/tailored for older adults are needed. To achieve this goal and better meet older adults' needs, more detailed data on facility characteristics are needed to build the knowledge base on improving the treatment environment.

Methods An orthotopic PCa model in mice was established by injection of human DU145 cells into the prostate gland lateral lobe of NOD.CB17-Prkdc(scid)/NcrCrlBltw (NOD-SCID) mice. Cancer growth was quantified by a luciferase-based in vivo imaging system (IVIS) serially every 7 days. Comparisons were made for urodynamic parameters, bladder histology, and biological markers until the sixth week. Bladder wall structural changes were assessed by the bladder wall thickness and degree of fibrosis. Biomarker expressions in bladder tissue including muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 2 (M-2), transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 4 (TRPV4), BCL2-associated X protein (Bax), and caspase3 were evaluated by immunohistochemical staining and immunofluorescence confocal laser scanning microscopy. Results DU145 cell growth in the prostate was successfully monitored by a luciferase-based IVIS. after orthotopic injection. Using our injection technique, no anatomical obstruction of the bladder outlet and urethra was noted up to 6 weeks after injection. The presence of PCa induced changes in urinary bladder histology, biomarkers, and urodynamic parameters. Cystometry showed features of detrusor overactivity with increased voiding frequency and high-amplitude voiding contractions from the fourth week onward. Histological analyses 4 weeks after DU145 injection demonstrated detrusor thickening and bladder wall fibrosis. Immunohistochemistry showed increased expressions of bladder M-2, TRPV4, Bax, and caspase3 in the PCa mice as early as in the first or second week. Conclusions PCa can induce bladder microenvironment changes involving neural receptors and biological mediators leading to histological and functional alterations even in the absence of overt anatomical obstruction.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 5799}

Although evidence for the hypothesized six-factor solution has been widely reported, some studies have indicated problems with the Future Negative items. Given that a large and growing literature has emerged on the six-factor AATI-TA, and that AATI-TA scores have shown much better and more consistent fit than other temporal psychology measures, we sought to investigate the future negative factor in detail.

Confirmatory factor analyses revealed that the fit for the five Future Negative items was poor. Modification indices suggested that a correlated error term between Items 4 and 10 would result in good fit, and this was indeed the case.

We sought to evaluate the characteristics of carotid plaque and to find out the predictors for high-risk carotid plaque in asymptomatic Koreans. Methods. Subjects (n=801) without a history of ASCVD from 12 university hospitals in Korea underwent carotid ultrasound. The images were standardized at core laboratory. Morphologic characteristics of plaque were analyzed with laboratory and clinical characteristics. High-risk carotid plaque features included the highest quartile of carotid plaque score (cPS), irregular plaque surface, and hypoechoic and ulcerated plaque. Results. The carotid plaque prevalence was 22.1% (177/801 persons, 293 plaques). The plaque was increased with age (p<0.001) and conventional ASCVD risk estimator (p<0.001) and the most frequently found in bulb (n=190, 64.8%). The number of the highest quartile of cPS was 44/177 (24.9%). Irregular plaque was seen in 20.8% out of total plaque (61/293) and was more frequent in the high-risk 10-year ASCVD risk group than in the low-risk group (36.1% vs. 15.8%, p=0.023). Hypoechoic and ulcerated plaques were seen in 14.3% (42/293) and 2% (6/293), respectively.

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is one of the fundamental compounds in green tea. The present study was to evaluate the protective effect of EGCG in oxidative damage and apoptosis induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in chicken lymphocytes. Results showed that preincubation of lymphocytes with EGCG significantly decreased H2O2-reduced cell viability and apoptotic cells with DNA damage, restored the H2O2-dependent reduction in total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), and glutathione disulfide (GSSG), and suppressed the increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), nitric oxide synthesis (NOS), malondialdehyde (MDA), lipid peroxide (LPO), and protein carbonyl (Carbonyl). In addition, preincubation of the cells with EGCG increased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and reduced calcium ion ([Ca2+]i) load. The protective effect of EGCG in oxidative damage in lymphocytes was accompanied by mRNA expression of SOD, Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), Catalase (CAT), GSH-PX, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and thioredoxin-1 (Trx-1). As EGCG had been removed before lymphocytes were challenged with H2O2, the activation of genes such as Nrf2 and Trx-1 by preincubation with EGCG could be the main reason for EGCG to protect the cells from oxidative damage by H2O2. Since oxidative stress is an important mechanism of biological damage and is regarded as the reasons of several pathologies, the present findings may be helpful for the use of tea products to prevent oxidative stress and maintain healthy in both humans and animals.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 5846}

To address this challenge, we propose a user-assisted curve extrusion method to obtain the reference 3D shape. We render the synthesized reference 3D shape with a consistent style into the visual scaffold. By following the generated visual scaffold, the users can efficiently design clipart with their desired viewpoints.

When Monotheism, after many centuries, made its way to the Greeks and Romans from the small corner of the world where it existed, we know how the notion of daemons facilitated its reception, by making it unnecessary for Christians to deny the existence of the gods previously believed in, it being sufficient to place them under the absolute power of the new God, as the gods of Olympus were already under that of Zeus, and as the local deities of all the subjugated nations had been subordinated by conquest to the divine patrons of the Roman State.

Asthma guidelines recommend that providers prescribe a spacer for all patients using pMDI. The objective of this study was to examine whether microbial contamination of spacer devices is associated with poor asthma outcomes. Methods This was a cross-sectional, single-center case series of seven pediatric patients with persistent asthma who had previously been prescribed a spacer. Spacers were swabbed with sterile cotton and samples assessed for bacterial/fungal growth. Parents completed a questionnaire including Asthma Control Test (ACT) and asthma control was assessed by an Allergist/Immunologist physician. Results Two (n = 2) children's parent-completed ACT score indicated poorly controlled asthma and three (n = 3) patients were noted to be poorly controlled by the physician. All but one caregiver reported cleaning the spacer with most reporting (n = 5) that they cleaned their child's spacer monthly and one (n = 1) reporting cleaning it every two weeks. One spacer had detected Candida albicans. There was not a statistically significant association between ACT score and microbial growth (p > 0.05).

Next, a typical operational scenario is used as an exemplification to show system dynamics. The characteristics of this conceptualised DM are then mapped to the identified maintenance problems of industry. Then, interesting initiatives in this domain are highlighted, and finally, the challenges to realize this approach are discussed. Findings This paper identified a set of problems related to maintenance in industry. In order to solve current industrial problems, exploit emerging digital technologies and elevate future industries, it will be necessary to develop new maintenance approaches. The mapping between the criteria of DM and maintenance problems shows the potential of this concept and gives a reason to examine it empirically in future work.

Methods: We examined employment outcomes by comparing clinical, neurocognitive, and social cognitive features in 234 participants with Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders across t competitive employment outcomes: currently employed, participants who had never worked for a year, and those who had been employed but developed long-term unemployment. We examined social cognition and neurocognition, as well as positive and negative schizophrenia symptoms, and premorbid functioning and demographic factors. Results: We found significant differences in age, race, premorbid functioning, cognitive performance, and social cognition between currently and formerly employed patients. When individual tasks were examined, emotion recognition and verbal working memory performance were the domains differentiating the groups. Older African Americans were over-represented in the formerly employed group. Conclusions: There were minimal differences other than age and race between formerly employed patients and those who had never worked.

{"label": "NEG", "text": "There is growing interest in management and organizational research to study the relocation of knowledge workers, defined as a move by the knowledge worker to a different place of work. Relocation has been well studied as a potential source of losses or gains in human and social capital. However, our understanding of whether and how it disrupts a scientist's innovation activities is limited. Relocation could disrupt innovation activities in the new workplace by making it difficult for a scientist to coordinate work with prior collaborators with whom the scientist has relational experience and forcing the scientist to work with new collaborators. In this study, we develop a conceptual framework assessing the effectiveness of the scientists' research and development (R&D) experience to counter these disruptions arising from relocation and develop valuable patented innovations. We hypothesize that both the scientist's relational experience and working with new collaborators decrease the value of innovations the scientist creates after relocation. Scientist R&D experience, however, is double-edged in nature: It leads to less valuable innovations prior to relocation but facilitates the creation of more valuable innovations after it. Our theory suggests that this is because R&D experience facilitates the scientist's adaptation to the new context and helps coordinate her or his activities in new collaborations. Nevertheless, R&D experience is less effective in sustaining the efficacy of relational experience with prior collaborators after relocation.

Ten questions were focused on demographic information, five items evaluated online class behavior of students, 9 items evaluated self-efficacy and four items measured academic performance. Findings Multitasking behavior was found to negatively influence self-efficacy of -0.332, whereas self-efficacy showed a positive influence of 0.325 on academic performance. Cronbach's alpha and average variance extracted values were 0.780 and 0.527 (multitasking behavior), 0.875 and 0.503 (self-efficacy), 0.781 and 0.601 (academic performance). Outcomes of the bootstrapping test showed that the path coefficients are significant. Originality/value The research findings may help university managers understand undergraduates' online and face-to-face behavior and strategies to improve the behavior to ensure the best academic outcomes. The novelty is based on using the partial least square structural equation modeling technique.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 5910}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Background: A potential risk of neuropsychiatric adverse events (NPAEs) of oseltamivir has remained controversial by retrospective cohort studies. This nationwide population-based cohort study aimed to assess the risk of NPAEs in influenza patients undergoing oseltamivir treatment (users) compared with a propensity score-matched cohort of patients not receiving oseltamivir (non-users). Research design and methods: Using the Korean National Health Service-Sample Cohort Database, patients diagnosed with incident influenza during 2003-2013 were divided into two cohorts: oseltamivir users and non-users. We calculated adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for the 5-day treatment course with oseltamivir using Cox regression analysis. Results: The incidence rate of NPAEs during 5-day oseltamivir treatment was 0.0029 and 0.0023 in oseltamivir users and non-users, respectively. The risk of NPAEs was different according to age, with an increased risk in patients aged 10-19 years (aHR 2.69, 95% CI 1.05-6.93) and a decreased risk in patients aged 0-9 years (aHR 0.46, 95% CI 0.24-0.88). The non-significant positive associations were observed in patients aged 20-64 years and those aged greater than 65 years. Conclusions: Although the reason for the inverse association in children aged 0-9 years is unknown, oseltamivir could increase the risk of NPAEs for children or adolescents aged greater than 10 years.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 5917}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have gained global attention in recent times due to their vast applications in various fields. These networks can face the disruption of data transmission due to sensor node failures when placed in harsh, inaccessible, and adverse environments such as battlefields or monitoring in enemy territory. The specific tasks performed by the collaboration among the sensor nodes in WSNs by internode connectivity may be terminated. Besides this, due to the failure of sensor nodes, the area covered by the network may be limited, which can cause damage to the objectives for such a network, as there might be an unaware danger in the lost area. Connectivity is a big problem in mobile WSNs due to the mobility of nodes. Researchers have developed a lot of algorithms that are capable enough for connectivity problems, but they do not emphasize the loss of coverage. We try to fill these gaps by proposing the new hybrid algorithm PACR (Position-Aware protocol for Connectivity Restoration). The concept behind PACR is the same as a person who writes his will before death on a deathbed. In the same way, when the sensor energy is below the threshold, it is converted into a recovery coordinator and generates a recovery plan. This accelerates the recovery by decreasing the time needed for failure identification. For the recovery process, the neighbor's nodes do not travel to the exact position of the failed node. Instead, they just move to the distance where they can build communication links with other nodes. This greatly prolongs the network lifetime. The simulation results show that PACR outperforms other techniques present in the literature.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 5924}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Globally, cities and urban areas are expanding rapidly, leading to increased human-wildlife conflict. To reduce human-snake conflict in Australia, 'snake catchers' are employed to remove and relocate snakes detected by the public in urban or rural areas. Where records of human-snake interactions are being collected, these data can inform our understanding of human-snake conflict and, potentially, snake urban ecology. In this study, we analysed 5210 snake-human interactions collected over a 7-year period (2011-2017) in Darwin, Australia, to investigate temporal patterns in species activity and identify environmental drivers of human-snake conflict. Encouragingly, about 90% of recorded human-snake interactions during this period in Darwin were with harmless snakes. While there was no clear effect of human activity biasing snake callout patterns at temporal scales greater than one day, reduced callouts between 00:00 and 06:00 may be driven by either reduced human or snake activity. We found population trends of all taxa investigated, except for elapids, to be stable. Elapids appeared to have suffered a small, yet statistically significant, decline. We also found that all taxa showed strong cyclical patterns within years, with considerable variation between species in the timing of annual peaks in activity.

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Main observation and conclusion The E3 ligase adaptor SPOP, overexpressed in the nucleus but frequently dislocated into the cytoplasm in all clear cell Renal Cell Carcinomas (ccRCC), serves as a regulatory hub to promote kidney cancer through the ubiquitination and degradation of multiple downstream cancer proteins. Recently, our identification of a selective small-molecule inhibitor of the SPOP-phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) interaction has demonstrated that the oncogenic SPOP-protein interaction would be a druggable target specific to ccRCC therapy. To our knowledge, this is the first time such a small-molecule inhibitor has been developed. Herein, we have identified a peptide binder for the SPOP-MATH domain that disrupts the oncogenic SPOP-protein interactions in kidney cancer cells. Computational design and biophysical characterization yielded peptide Pep38 that binds to the MATH domain of SPOP and competes on PTEN-binding to SPOP in vitro. The X-ray complex structure reveals that the peptide binder features the following combination: one, a mimic of the native peptide binder and two, an additional beta-strand motif in sequence, which could contribute to increased binding affinity. In order to improve cellular permeability, we fused Pep38 with the delivery peptide TAT to prepare peptide TAT38, which inhibits the endogenous substrate binding to SPOP and suppresses the proliferation of the ccRCC cells. Our identification of the peptide inhibitors for SPOP-protein interactions provides further validation that the oncogenic SPOP-signaling pathway in ccRCC could be a druggable target specifically applicable to the therapy of kidney cancers.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 5932}

I assessed these descriptive results against a set of broadly agreed-on criteria for \"effective\" PD: content specificity, relevance, voluntariness/autonomy, social interaction, and sustained duration. Findings revealed a mixed record. Commendable improvements in content-specific PD access were undercut by deficiencies in social interaction, voluntariness/autonomy, sustained duration, and relevance. School policy, as reported by teachers, was grossly inadequate, with only one of the nine PD-supportive measures appearing on SASS reaching a majority of teachers in any given survey year.

{"label": "NEG", "text": "During the Aptian (Cretaceous), in what is now the South Atlantic, the largest chemogenic (abiotic) carbonate factory so far identified in the Phanerozoic geological record developed as a vast hyper-alkaline lake system. This covered at least 330 000 km(2), producing carbonates, locally over 500 m thick, in what are now the offshore Santos and Campos basins (Brazil), and Kwanza Basin (Angola). Current evidence supports the view that almost all of this carbonate was chemogenic in origin, precipitated from hyper-alkaline, shallow lake waters, probably by evaporation. This unit, best documented from offshore Brazil and known as the Barra Velha Formation (Santos Basin) and the Macabu Formation (Campos Basin), consists of just two basic carbonate components, millimetre to centimetre sized crystal shrubs and spherulites. These are commonly in situ but can also be reworked into a range of detrital facies. Demonstrable microbialites are generally rare. These carbonates are associated with Mg silicates (as clays) which had a profound influence not only on the textural development of the in situ carbonates, but also on their diagenesis. The dissolution of the clays produced much of the porosity in these limestones, which are the hosts for multi-billion barrel oil fields. The source of the carbonate was most likely from metasomatic alteration of mafic rocks, such as continental flood basalts related to Atlantic opening, with some contribution from much older continental basement. Clear evidence that serpentinization of possible exhumed mantle is lacking but mantle CO2 is likely to have been a critical factor in determining the composition of the fluids from which the carbonates formed and the high alkalinities of the lake waters.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 5962}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Purpose Corporate social responsibility (CSR) reporting has been theorized as a key communication device and an integral part of a broader stakeholder integration management strategy. This paper aims to examine the relationship between CSR disclosures and organized labor, an important internal stakeholder, whose institutional role in dynamically advancing employee interests creates opportunities and challenges for strategic management and firm sustainability. Design/methodology/approach By using a sample of 2,526 US firm-year observations for the period 2002-2015, the authors demonstrate that managers in unionized contexts are more likely to issue CSR reports than managers in firms, where labor is not organized. Findings The authors demonstrate that managers in unionized contexts are more likely to issue CSR reports than managers in firms where labor is not organized. Considering stakeholder theory, they argue that, in unionized contexts, managers more intensively resort to CSR disclosures to form an alignment of interests, develop collaborative bonds with unions and smoothen relationships with external financial stakeholders. This effect is more prominent in areas where corporate spatial clustering and the prevailing political ideology facilitate the role of unions. Research limitations/implications First, the data refer to USA, which may limit the generalization of the results. Hence, researchers could use cross-country datasets to overcome this limitation. Second, it would be important to know what benefits are enjoyed by the unionized companies that issue CSR reports. Third, they acknowledge that there is useful qualitative information they do not analyze. This analysis could potentially relate specific CSR information to unions' needs and demands. Further, there are alternative channels through which companies disclose relevant information such as 10-K filings, annual reports, firm websites, media, public announcements, etc. These are not captured by the data. Practical implications Managers could benefit from the empirical analysis, which suggests that through the initiation of CSR reports a dialogue with unions is greatly facilitated. Managers should consider that CSR reports reduce information asymmetries and may attract the interest of investors. Unionists should be aware that CSR reports constitute an opportunity to identify mutual interests and align goals. Business analysts, investors and shareholders should be aware that standalone CSR reports are used by managers to reduce information asymmetries and disparities with unions and to communicate an investment-friendly context. So, market participants should factor such policies by unionized firms into their investment analyses. Social implications The authors offer implications for managers, labor unionists and market participants.

After that, scaffold osteoinductivity was studied by bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) osteogenic differentiation while growing on the decellularized Cb leaves. Cells mineralization, calcium secretion, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, and expression levels of bone-related genes were determined during the differentiation process. Our results from the structural characterization of the scaffolds demonstrated that decellularized Cb leaves are good candidates for bone differentiation in terms of surface roughness, mechanical properties, and interconnected pores. Osteogenic differentiation evaluation of the BM-MSCs determined that the cell's ALP activity and mineralization were increased significantly while cultured on the decellularized Cb leaves compared to the cells cultured on the culture plate as a control. Besides, Runx2, ALP, collagen-1 (Col-I), and osteocalcin genes were expressed in cells cultured on decellularized Cb leaves significantly higher than cells cultured on the culture plate.

There are several definitions of refractory myasthenia, and their performances have not been compared. Having valid and reliable criteria can help select patients in whom more aggressive treatments may be needed. Methods We applied five different refractory myasthenia criteria (Drachman, Mantegazza, Suh, the International Consensus Guideline (ICG), and the randomised controlled trial of eculizumab in refractory, anti-acetylcholine receptor positive, generalised myasthenia gravis (REGAIN), to a cohort of 237 patients. We compared the proportion of refractory patients among different criteria and their scores on disease severity, fatigue, and quality-of-life (QoL) scales. We also assessed the agreement for each criterion between two trained assessors. Results The Drachman, Mantegazza, and Suh criteria resulted in high proportions of refractory individuals (40.1%, 39.2%, and 38.8%, respectively), compared with the ICG and REGAIN criteria (9.7% and 3.0%, respectively). Refractory patients by the ICG and REGAIN criteria had worse disease severity, QoL, and fatigue scores, compared with patients classified as refractory by other criteria. All criteria had high agreement between raters (between 70% and 100%). Conclusions There is high variability in the proportion of refractory myasthenia gravis patients depending on the criteria used, with ICG and REGAIN criteria capturing patients with worse disease severity. This reflects conceptual differences as to what refractory means.

{"label": "NEG", "text": "This paper aimed to study the anomalous fluctuation of halogens with respect to the pollution status in surface water (w), pore water (p), and sediments (s) of Lake Mariout. It provided a framework for understanding the distribution of dissolved and precipitated halogen salts related to the pollution status of the lake. The study cleared out that bromide was only the most abundant halogen in the three studied partitions. On contrast, sediment's partition contained the lowest chloride content. Fluoride minerals, especially, fluorapatites and carbonate-fluorapatite (FAP and CFAP), had high Saturation Index (SI) values in surface water (42.77-51.95 and 16.04-60.89, respectively) and in pore water (51.26-54.60 and 17.52-78.33, respectively). Bromide and chloride were mainly found in the soluble forms in the surface water and pore waters. Iodide salts, (Ca(IO3)(2) and Ca(IO3)(2).6H(2)O), were moderately precipitated in surface and pore waters. Thus, SI content reflected that halogens, especially fluoride and iodide, played a vital role in reducing lake pollution. Fluorite (CaF2) and sellaite (MgF2) could only be formed in pore water, while calcite and aragonite could be deposited from surface water. In addition, Cl was mainly found in the forms of NaCl, CaCl2, MgCl2, and KCl in surface and pore waters. The multivariate analysis revealed that fluoride precipitate may serve in decreasing the dissolved salt pollution. Multivariate analysis showed that in the long run, the fluoride precipitation in FAP and CFAP can significantly adsorb and absorb various pollutants and can protect the lake from pollution. The ecological risk assessment conducted by calculating the enrichment factor (EF) showed that the lake was still unpolluted. Regarding human health risks, at appropriate levels of human health and safety, the hazard quotient (HQ) and hazard index (HI) of halogens found to be lower than these reported levels. Hence, ingestion and dermal absorption routes of halogens by surface water and sediments did not pose any adverse effects to population reflecting uncontaminated status of Lake Mariout.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 5996}

Today, the renewed interest of designers and historians has made the parkway an important part of the heritage of urban planning, confronted with major projects and operations that mobilize different scales, uses and disciplines, between conflicting urban policies and temporal shifts.

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Background Although recommendations encourage daily moderate activities in post aortic dissection, very little data exists regarding cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) to personalize those patient's physical rehabilitation and assess their cardiovascular prognosis. Design We aimed at testing the prognostic insight of CPET regarding aortic and cardiovascular events by exploring a prospective cohort of patients followed-up after acute aortic dissection. Methods Patients referred to our department after an acute (type A or B) aortic dissection were prospectively included in a cohort between September 2012 and October 2017. CPET was performed once optimal blood pressure control was obtained. Clinical follow-up was done after CPET for new aortic event and major cardio-vascular events (MCE) not directly related to the aorta. Results Among the 165 patients who underwent CPET, no adverse event was observed during exercise testing. Peak oxygen pulse was 1.46(1.22-1.84) mlO2/beat, that is, 97 (83-113) % of its predicted value, suggesting cardiac exercise limitation in a population under beta blockers (92% of the population). During a follow-up of 39(20-51) months from CPET, 42 aortic event recurrences and 22 MCE not related to aorta occurred. Low peak oxygen pulse (<85% of predicted value) was independently predictive of aortic event recurrence, while low peak oxygen uptake (<70% of predicted value) was an independent predictor of MCE occurrence. Conclusion CPET is safe in postaortic dissection patients should be used to not only to personalize exercise rehabilitation, but also to identify those patients with the highest risk for new aortic events and MCE not directly related to aorta.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 6027}

The excellent preservation allows us to exam the previous unrecognised cranial characters. Megantereon shows a clear affinity to Smilodon in many aspects, e.g. wide nasal with parallel lateral border and smoothly curved posterior border, presence of moderately developed antero-medial process of the nasal, presence of anterior accessory process of the frontal, and a distinct frontal depression behind the posterior border of the nasal.

In this research study, the magnetic abrasive finishing process (MAF) has been studied using the ANN-GA approach, where ANN has been used for modeling of input-output relations, and GA has been used to optimize the MAF process. The experiments were conducted on a pulsating DC sourced MAF set-up, and SiC-based loosely bonded magnetic abrasive media was used for material removal. During experimentation, the current, machining gap, speed of rotation, abrasive composition, and finishing time were taken as input parameters being arranged in an array of L16 orthogonal. In contrast, output parameters were changed in surface roughness, change in the microhardness, and change in the modulus of elastic indentation.

We showed that anisomycin inhibited growth, migration, and survival in NSCLC cells regardless of genetic mutation status, and to a greater extent than in normal lung epithelial cells. Isobologram analysis showed that the combination of anisomycin with cisplatin, paclitaxel, or gefitinib was synergistic in NSCLC but not normal lung cells.

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Background Soil salinity is one of the major abiotic stress factors that affect crop growth and yield, which seriously restricts the sustainable development of agriculture. Quinoa is considered as one of the most promising crops in the future for its high nutrition value and strong adaptability to extreme weather and soil conditions. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the adaptive response to salinity stress of quinoa remain poorly understood. To identify candidate genes related to salt tolerance, we performed reference-guided assembly and compared the gene expression in roots treated with 300 mM NaCl for 0, 0.5, 2, and 24 h of two contrasting quinoa genotypes differing in salt tolerance. Results The salt-tolerant (ST) genotype displayed higher seed germination rate and plant survival rate, and stronger seedling growth potential as well than the salt-sensitive (SS) genotype under salt stress. An average of 38,510,203 high-quality clean reads were generated. Significant Gene Ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways were identified to deeper understand the differential response. Transcriptome analysis indicated that salt-responsive genes in quinoa were mainly related to biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, alpha-Linolenic acid metabolism, plant hormone signal transduction, and metabolic pathways. Moreover, several pathways were significantly enriched amongst the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in ST genotypes, such as phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, plant-pathogen interaction, isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis, and tyrosine metabolism. One hundred seventeen DEGs were common to various stages of both genotypes, identified as core salt-responsive genes, including some transcription factor members, like MYB, WRKY and NAC, and some plant hormone signal transduction related genes, like PYL, PP2C and TIFY10A, which play an important role in the adaptation to salt conditions of this species. The expression patterns of 21 DEGs were detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and confirmed the reliability of the RNA-Seq results. Conclusions We identified candidate genes involved in salt tolerance in quinoa, as well as some DEGs exclusively expressed in ST genotype. The DEGs common to both genotypes under salt stress may be the key genes for quinoa to adapt to salinity environment. These candidate genes regulate salt tolerance primarily by participating in reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging system, protein kinases biosynthesis, plant hormone signal transduction and other important biological processes. These findings provide theoretical basis for further understanding the regulation mechanism underlying salt tolerance network of quinoa, as well establish foundation for improving its tolerance to salinity in future breeding programs.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 6060}

This can compromise image quality since the detector has a limited dynamic range. In principle, suitable bowtie filters can reduce transmitted X-rays through thinner parts of the body so that it is uniform at the detector surface.Aim: This study explores the possibility of using mathematical data modelling of transmission data to act as a virtual bowtie filter. The virtual filter is applied after the acquisition of projection data and can be based on body shape. In this study, the virtual bowtie filter is constructed from breast contour information and applied to transmitted x-ray beam profiles produced in egs_cbct Monte Carlo simulations.Methods and materials: The Breastsimulator software was used to generate suitable breast phantoms. Egs_cbct simulated X-ray transport through these phantoms. One simulation included a bowtie filter that accounted for breast shape as a control. Projection images were acquired over 360 degrees without the bowtie filter. We designed a bowtie filter and corrected the transmitted X-ray profiles based on its shape.Results: Image contrast indicated any improvement in image quality. Results indicated that using a virtual bowtie correction method improved image quality as well as a reduction in cupping artefacts.Conclusion: It is a useful method to improve the image quality without the need to incorporate a real bowtie filter during measurements.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 6070}

Participants, drawn from the national Head Start CARES study, were 314 4-year-old children in one of 107 Head Start centers. Teachers' reports of children's behavior and social skills were entered into a latent profile analysis that revealed a four-profile structure with four subgroups of unstably housed children that were distinct in their functioning. Potential predictors of profiles included parent self-reports of their own psychological distress and education, teacher reports of the quality of relationships with the children, and observed teacher emotional support of students.

Tightly focused, radially polarized laser pulses have been proposed for electron acceleration because of their strong longitudinal electric field, making them ideal for VLA. However, experimental results have been limited until now because injecting electrons into the laser field has remained a considerable challenge. Here, we demonstrate experimentally that using a plasma mirror as an injector solves this problem and permits us to inject electrons at the ideal phase of the laser, resulting in the acceleration of electrons along the laser propagation direction while reducing the electron beam divergence compared to the linear polarization case. We obtain electron bunches with few-MeV energies and a 200-pC charge, thus demonstrating, for the first time, electron acceleration to relativistic energies using a radially polarized laser. High-harmonic generation from the plasma surface is also measured, and it provides additional insight into the injection of electrons into the laser field upon its reflection on the plasma mirror. Detailed comparisons between experimental results and full 3D simulations unravel the complex physics of electron injection and acceleration in this new regime: We find that electrons are injected into the radially polarized pulse in the form of two spatially separated bunches emitted from the p-polarized regions of the focus. Finally, we leverage on the insight brought by this study to propose and validate a more optimal experimental configuration that can lead to extremely peaked electron angular distributions and higher energy beams.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 6086}

This paper addresses the global issue about cross-border M&A in banking sector, particularly exploring the role of difference in the independent shareholder and board size between acquirer and target banks on synergy gains based on the international study. Design/methodology/approach Based on cross-border bank M&As data on 59 deals from 1995 to 2009, we initially apply social network analysis techniques to explore the country connectedness of the acquirer-target banks in cross-border M&As. Ordinary least squares (OLS) with robust standard errors is further used to investigate synergy gains within the difference in the degree of bank independent shareholder and board sizes between the acquirer and target banks. Findings Our results indicate that the acquiring banks are generally interconnected with the targeted banks and that some of acquiring banks are clearly concentrated in Asian countries including China, Hong Kong, and Philippines. Moreover, we find that cross-border M&As with larger difference in independent shareholders between the bidder and target bank would result in higher synergy gains in all cases of takeover premiums on 1 day, 1 week and 4 weeks. In addition, financial differences between the bidder and target banks have a significant impact on synergetic gains, a topic not explored in previous studies. There is no evidence that institutional and governance differences between bidder and target bank have significant cross-border impacts on takeover premiums with respect to 1 day, 1 week and 4 weeks, respectively.

Selection of this library by a pTyr peptide led to the identification of SH2 variants with enhanced affinities measured by EC50. Fluorescent polarization was then applied to quantify the binding affinities of the newly identified SH2 variants. As a result, three SH2 variants, named V3, V13 and V24, have comparable binding affinities with the previously identified SH2 triple-mutant superbinder. Biolayer Interferometry assay was employed to disclose the kinetics of the binding of these SH2 superbinders to the phosphotyrosine peptide. The results indicated that all the SH2 superbinders have two-orders increase of the dissociation rate when binding the pTyr peptide while there was no significant change in their associate rates. Intriguingly, though binding the pTyr peptide with comparable affinity with other SH2 superbinders, the V3 does not bind to the sTyr peptide. However, variant V13 and V24 have cross-reactivity with both pTyr and sTyr peptides. The newly identified superbinders could be utilized as tools for the identification of pTyr-containing proteins from tissues under different physiological or pathophysiological conditions and may have the potential in the therapeutics.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 6096}

Several approaches have been used to extend the half-life of rFVIII to improve prophylaxis outcomes. An indirect comparison of pivotal clinical trial data was performed to evaluate the relative efficacy of two extended half-life therapies approved for the prophylactic treatment of haemophilia A: recombinant FVIII-IgG(1) Fc domain fusion protein (rFVIIIFc) and pegylated rFVIII (BAY 94-9027). Methods Matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) was conducted to compare the rFVIIIFc individualised prophylaxis arm of the A-LONG phase III clinical trial (n = 117) and the BAY 94-9027 approved dosing regimens of the PROTECT VIII phase II/III study (n = 110). Following matching for baseline characteristics, mean annualised bleeding rate (ABR) and the proportion of patients with zero bleeds were compared for rFVIIIFc and BAY 94-9027. Additional supportive analyses comparing rFVIIIFc individualised prophylaxis and the individual prophylaxis regimens included in the PROTECT VIII group (twice weekly, and every 5 and 7 days [Q5D and Q7D]) were conducted. Results Mean ABR was lower in the rFVIIIFc individualised prophylaxis group versus the BAY 94-9027 pooled prophylaxis population (3.0 versus 4.9), providing a clinically relevant and statistically significant difference (mean difference [MD] - 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] - 3.5 to - 0.4). A statistically significant difference in ABR was also observed for rFVIIIFc compared with BAY 94-9027 Q7D (3.2 versus 6.4; MD - 3.3; 95% CI - 6.4 to - 0.2). The difference in the proportion of patients with zero bleeds between rFVIIIFc (46.5%) and BAY 94-9027 pooled prophylaxis population (38.2%) was not statistically significant (odds ratio 1.4; 95% CI 0.8 to 2.5). Conclusions This indirect treatment comparison indicates a statistically significant and clinically relevant difference in ABR favouring individualised prophylaxis with rFVIIIFc versus BAY 94-9027 prophylaxis. The proportion of patients with zero bleeds was numerically greater with rFVIIIFc treatment but did not achieve statistical significance.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 6097}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "BackgroundElectrocardiogram (ECG) signal, an important indicator for heart problems, is commonly corrupted by a low-frequency baseline wander (BW) artifact, which may cause interpretation difficulty or inaccurate analysis. Unlike current state-of-the-art approach using band-pass filters, wavelet transforms can accurately capture both time and frequency information of a signal. However, extant literature is limited in applying wavelet transforms (WTs) for baseline wander removal. In this study, we aimed to evaluate 5 wavelet families with a total of 14 wavelets for removing ECG baseline wanders from a semi-synthetic dataset.MethodsWe created a semi-synthetic ECG dataset based on a public QT Database on Physionet repository with ECG data from 105 patients. The semi-synthetic ECG dataset comprised ECG excerpts from the QT database superimposed with artificial baseline wanders. We extracted one ECG excerpt from each of 105 patients, and the ECG excerpt comprised 14s of randomly selected ECG data. Twelve baseline wanders were manually generated, including sinusoidal waves, spikes and step functions. We implemented and evaluated 14 commonly used wavelets up to 12 WT levels. The evaluation metric was mean-square-error (MSE) between the original ECG excerpt and the processed signal with artificial BW removed.ResultsAmong the 14 wavelets, Daubechies-3 wavelet and Symlets-3 wavelet with 7 levels of WT had best performance, MSE=0.0044. The average MSEs for sinusoidal waves, step, and spike functions were 0.0271, 0.0304, 0.0199 respectively. For artificial baseline wanders with spikes or step functions, wavelet transforms in general had lower performance in removing the BW; however, WTs accurately located the temporal position of an impulse edge.ConclusionsWe found wavelet transforms in general accurately removed various baseline wanders.

We aimed to establish the best blood biomarker panel to evaluate the coronary artery disease (CAD) severity. Plasma levels of MMP-3 and MMP-9, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2, Apo-CII, Apo-CIII and Apo-E were measured in 472 patients with CAD evaluated by coronary angiography and electrocardiography, and in 285 healthy controls. MMP-3 and MMP-9 plasma levels in CAD patients were significantly increased (P < 0.001) compared to controls (3.54- and 3.81-fold, respectively). Furthermore, these increments are modulated by CAD severity as well as for Apo-CII and Apo-CIII levels (P < 0.001).

It is grounded in the uses and gratification perspective to examine five distinct types of stimuli for binge-viewing and short watching: enjoyment, efficiency, information seeking, social interaction, and relaxation. Results of the analyses demonstrate that enjoyment and efficiency are positively associated with the tendency toward binge-viewing. However, the inclination toward short watching is correlated to enjoyment, efficiency, social interaction, and information seeking, and relaxation was not predictive of either inclination. The study also contemplated loneliness and addiction as moderating variables for binge-viewing and short watching behaviour.

The SEM results of the two-group analysis revealed that loneliness and addiction affected motivation and influenced attitudes toward binge-viewing and short watching.

{"label": "NEG", "text": "This paper presents a generalized, elastoviscoplastic constitutive model, MIT-SR, that is capable of describing a wide range of time-dependent characteristics observed in clays from creep to strain-rate-dependent shear behavior. The key component of the proposed model is a novel evolution equation that attributes viscoplastic deformations to a state variable, R-a, referred to as internal strain rate, which represents the perturbation of the clay particle assembly due to historical straining. This state variable is driven by external straining actions (under compression or shear), which can be intrinsically linked to the loading step in classical plasticity theory, and decays with time representing a fading memory process. The proposed framework can be used to extend existing time-independent elastoplastic models. In this case, MIT-SR is built upon a prior elastoplastic model (MIT-S1), which uses 3-D stress-space surfaces and hardening laws to represent anisotropic effective stress-strain-strength properties, and a paraelastic approach to describe nonlinear hysteretic behavior at small strains. The paper highlights the versatility of the proposed MIT-SR model in representing a wide range of time-dependent characteristics for normally consolidation behavior and undrained shear behavior. By varying a strain-rate sensitivity parameter, beta, the model can capture a full spectrum from temporary material response to changing strain rate, to isotache-type behavior where the normal consolidation and critical state lines are functions of the applied steady strain rate. The paper also showcases the model prediction for undrained creep and undrained relaxation behavior, and its promising capability in describing rate-effects under cyclic direct simple shear.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 6118}

The 25 mg BID inhalation dosing was predicted to lead to alveolar HCQ levels of 7 mu M ( above EC50 of similar to 1-5 mu M), and small plasma levels of 0.18 mu M (as compared to plasma levels of 3.22 mu M after 200 mg BID oral dosing). However, average contact time ( > 1 mu M) is around 0.5 h in lung parts, suggesting indirect exposure response effect of HCQ.The developed PBPK model herein predicted HCQ levels in plasma and different lung parts of adults after multiple inhalation dosing regimens for 5 days. This in-silico work needs to be tested in vivo on healthy subjects and COVID-19 patients using 12.5 mg BID and 25 mg BID inhalation doses.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 6132}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Background: Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) survivors' increased risk for adverse health outcomes could be mitigated through consuming a balanced diet. Nonetheless, >70% of adult survivors do not meet survivorship dietary recommendations. ALL treatment may amplify risk for restricted dietary preferences (picky eating) and poor self-regulation of food intake that could contribute to suboptimal diets in survivorship. This study aims to: (a) characterize differences in picky eating and self-regulation of food intake between survivors and peer controls; and (b) examine the associations between these eating behaviors and dietary quality in ALL survivors relative to peer controls. Methods: Participants were children (5-13 years) with (n = 32) and without (n = 32) a history of ALL and their caregivers. Children's dietary quality (Healthy Eating Index-2015) was calculated from 24-h dietary recalls. Caregivers completed the Child Eating Behavior Questionnaire-Food Fussiness subscale and the Child Self-Regulation in Eating Questionnaire. Results: Independent samples t-tests revealed survivors exhibited greater picky eating than peer controls but comparable self-regulation of food intake. Bootstrapped grouped multivariate regression results showed that for ALL survivors, greater picky eating was associated with worse dietary quality (controlling for age and self-regulation of food intake). For peer controls, worse self-regulation of food intake was associated with poorer dietary quality (controlling for picky eating and age). Conclusions: Results provide preliminary support that different eating behaviors contribute to poor dietary quality in children with and without an ALL history. These findings suggest that interventions to improve ALL survivors' dietary quality may benefit targeting picky eating.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 6146}
{"label": "NEG", "text": "Aim Traditional approaches for including species' distributions in conservation planning have presented them as long-term averages of variation. Like these approaches, the main waterfowl conservation targeting tool in the United States Prairie Pothole Region (US PPR) is based primarily on long-term averaged distributions of breeding pairs. While this tool has supported valuable conservation, it does not explicitly consider spatiotemporal changes in spring wetland availability and does not assess wetland availability during the brood rearing period. We sought to develop a modelling approach and targeting tool that incorporated these types of dynamics for breeding waterfowl pairs and broods. This goal also presented an opportunity for us to compare predictions from a traditional targeting tool based on long-term averages to predictions from spatiotemporal models. Such a comparison facilitated tests of the underlying assumption that this traditional targeting tool could provide an effective surrogate measure for conservation objectives such as brood abundance and climate refugia. Location US PPR. Methods We developed spatiotemporal models of waterfowl pair and brood abundance within the US PPR. We compared the distributions predicted by these models and assessed similarity with the averaged pair data that is used to develop the current waterfowl targeting tool. Results Results demonstrated low similarity and correlation between the averaged pair data and spatiotemporal brood and pair models. The spatiotemporal pair model distributions served as better surrogates for brood abundance than the averaged pair data. Main conclusions Our study underscored the contributions that the current targeting tool has made to waterfowl conservation but also suggested that conservation plans in the region would benefit from the consideration of inter- and intra-annual dynamics. We suggested that using only the averaged pair data and derived products might result in the omission of 46%-98% of important pair and brood habitat, respectively, from conservation plans.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 6147}

Material/Methods: MTT assay was performed to examine the effect of piperine (concentrations of 0-300 mu M) on the proliferation of human gastric cancer SNU-16 cells and normal human gastric epithelial GES-1 cells. Flow cytometry and Western blot were used to determine cell apoptosis and the expression level of protein (Cyto C, cleaved PARP, cleaved caspase-3, Bax, Bcl-2, Bad, Bcl-xl, PI3K, pPI3K, Akt, and pAkt), respectively. To further investigate the anti-tumor mechanism of piperine in SNU-16 cells, we used a small-molecule Akt activator SC79 in this study. The in vivo mechanism of piperine against gastric cancer was evaluated using a xenograft tumor model. Results: The results showed that piperine inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis of SNU-16 cells. Piperine upregulated the protein expression of Bax, Bad, Cyto C, cleaved PARP, and cleaved caspase-3, but downregulated the protein expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, pPI3k, and pAkt. However, SC79 reversed the function of piperine on the apoptosis-related proteins. An in vivo study revealed that, compared with the control group, the tumor volume of mice treated with piperine was significantly reduced. Piperine enhanced cleaved caspase-3 expression but decreased Ki-67 expression in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the nontoxicity effect of piperine was confirmed by H&E staining analysis in kidney and heart tissues of mice.

We evaluated a total of 922 outpatients from March to September 2020. All patients underwent contemporary real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay tests from anterior nasal swab samples. Patients age 50.5 +/- 13.7 years (range 12 to 89), 61.6% women, at moderate or high risk for COVID-19 received empiric management via telemedicine. At least two agents with antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 (zinc, hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin) and one antibiotic (azithromycin, doxycycline, ceftriaxone) were used along with inhaled budesonide and/or intramuscular dexamethasone consistent with the emergent science on early COVID-19 treatment.

Inspired by the configuration of collagen fibers in monkey fingertips, this study proposes a soft tactile sensor containing a fiber structure. The sensor consists of three layers: the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous tissue, represented by natural rubber, elastomer resin, and urethane resin, respectively. The fiber structure made of the elastomer resin is in the form of quadrangular pyramids, with pillars expanding from the dermis layer to the bottom layer inside the urethane resin. Strain gauges are embedded in the shallow and deep portions of the sensor.

The distributions of cement particles in sand after curing were then measured using the EDTA titration test. The results show that, due to the filtration effect, the cement content along the radial direction of dispersion decreases nonlinearly in a reversed S shape. The filtration effect becomes more obvious when grouting with a higher grout concentration. With the decrease in grout concentration, the filtration effect becomes weak and cement particles could disperse farther in the sand layer, but the cement content in a farther location becomes lower and the improvement of the soil strength is limited. In the end, the measured results were compared with the calculated results according to an existing theoretical study and the trend reasonably matches with each other.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 6208}

To develop new drugs or therapies for OTCD, it is ideal to use models that are more closely related to human metabolism and pathology. Primary human hepatocytes (HHs) isolated from two patients (a 6-month-old boy and a 5-year-old girl) and a healthy donor were transplanted into host mice (hemi-, hetero-OTCD mice, and control mice, respectively). HHs were isolated from these mice and used for serial transplantation into the next host mouse or for in vitro experiments. Histological, biochemical, and enzyme activity analyses were performed. Cultured HHs were treated with ammonium chloride or therapeutic drugs. Replacement rates exceeded 80% after serial transplantation in both OTCD mice. These highly humanized OTCD mice showed characteristics similar to OTCD patients that included increased blood ammonia levels and urine orotic acid levels enhanced by allopurinol. Hemi-OTCD mice showed defects in OTC expression and significantly low enzymatic activities, while hetero-OTCD mice showed residual OTC expression and activities. A reduction in ammonium metabolism was observed in cultured HHs from OTCD mice, and treatment with the therapeutic drug reduced the ammonia levels in the culture medium. In conclusion, we established in vivo OTC mouse models with hemi- and hetero-patient HHs. HHs isolated from the mice were useful as an in vitro model of OTCD. These OTC models could be a source of valuable patient-derived hepatocytes that would enable large scale and reproducible experiments using the same donor.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 6215}

We can however see it as the culmination of various tendencies in modern French philosophy; first, the effort to bring philosophy into the open air of human nature, into immediate contact with life and with problems vital to humanity; secondly, the upholding of contingency in all things, thus ensuring human freedom; thirdly, a disparagement of purely intellectual constructions as true interpretations of human life and all existence, coupled with an insistence on an insight that transcends logical formulation.

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Purpose: Pentosan polysulfate sodium (PPS; Elmiron) is a FDA-approved heparanase inhibitor for the treatment of bladder pain and interstitial cystitis. The chronic use of PPS has been associated with a novel pigmentary maculopathy, associated with discrete vitelliform deposits that exhibit hyperfluorescence, macular hyper-pigmentary spots, and foci of nodular RPE enlargement. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the retinal morphology of heparanase knockout mice. Material and methods: The retinal morphology of heparanase knock-out and age-matched control wild type mice of 3-, 9- and 15-weeks old was characterized by means of histological evaluation. Immuno-histological stains for RPE65, F4/80 and Ki67 were performed for investigating the RPE, inflammatory and proliferating cells, respectively. Results: Histological analysis showed no changes in age-matched wild-type controls, whereas the eyes of heparanase null mice were characterized by alterations in RPE and neural retina, as manifest by RPE folds and choroidal thickening, detached RPE cells, thickening of the photoreceptor layer and retinal disorganization. The presence of discrete hyperfluorescent foci, however, was absent. The prevalence of the RPE/choroidal changes or protrusions seemed to progress over time and were correlated with more RPE65 signal rather than influx of F4/80- or Ki67-positive cells. These results indicate that the subretinal alterations were mostly RPE driven, without influx of inflammatory or proliferating cells. Conclusions: Our results indicate that heparanase deficiency in the mice leads to RPE folds, choroidal thickening, and retinal disorganization. The presence of discrete hyperfluorescent foci, a key characteristic of the human disease, was not observed. However, it can be concluded that some of the observations in mice are similar to those seen after chronic use of PPS in humans. These findings indicate that the toxicity observed in the presence of heparanase inhibitors is target-related and will preclude the clinical use of heparanase inhibition as a therapeutic intervention.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 6256}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Background Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most common gastrointestinal emergency in preterm infants. Survivors may suffer both short- and long-term morbidities. Current evidence suggests that the incidence of NEC can be reduced by standardizing the care delivery in addressing key risk factors including an altered gut microbiome, use of formula milk, hyperosmolar feeds, and unrestricted use of high-risk medications Methods Since 2014, the department has a workgroup who analyzed all cases of NEC within a month of diagnosis to identify preventable risk factors. Existing evidence-based quality improvement strategies were revised and new ones were implemented sequentially over the next 4 years. These strategies include (1) a standardized feeding protocol, (2) early initiation of enteral feeding using human milk, (3) optimization of the osmolality of preterm milk feeds using standardized dilution guidelines for additives, and (4) promotion of healthy microbiome by use of probiotics, early oral care with colostrum and by restricting high-risk medications and prolonged use of empirical antibiotics Results Baseline characteristics of the patients including sex, gestational age, and birth weight were similar during the study period. After implementing the evidence-based practices successively over 4 years, the incidence of NEC in very- low birth-weight (VLBW) infants dropped from 7% in 2014 to 0% (P < .001) in 2018. The duration of parenteral nutrition, use of central line, and days to full feeds were also reduced significantly (P < .05) Conclusion Adopting evidence-based best practices resulted in a significant decrease in the incidence of NEC and improved the nutrition outcomes in VLBW infants.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 6263}

And the extremity of the rational soul is opinion, which in his Sophista he defines to be that power which knows the conclusion of dianoia. This power also knows the universal in sensible particulars, as that every man is a biped, but it knows only the oti, or that a thing is, but is ignorant of the dioti, or why it is: knowledge of the latter kind being the province of the dianoetic power.

Experiments varied the energy release rate, burner aspect ratio, wind speed, and surface inclination angles. Mean gas temperature was nearly constant over the distance that flames attached to the down-wind or uphill surface. Beyond this region, mean temperature profiles declined as a power-function of distance, primarily due to increasing intermittency of flame impingement. A linear regression model characterized the power-law temperature profile and flame intermittency. The models were found to agree with measurements taken from spreading fires in laboratory and field experiments and suggest general scalability of predictions for characterizing convective heat transfer ahead of linear flame zones in wildland fires.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 6291}
{"label": "NEG", "text": "Background The importance of integrating the social sciences in epidemic preparedness and response has become a common feature of infectious disease policy and practice debates. However to date, this integration remains inadequate, fragmented and under-funded, with limited reach and small initial investments. Based on data collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, in this paper we analysed the variety of knowledge, infrastructure and funding gaps that hinder the full integration of the social sciences in epidemics and present a strategic framework for addressing them. Methods Senior social scientists with expertise in public health emergencies facilitated expert deliberations, and conducted 75 key informant interviews, a consultation with 20 expert social scientists from Africa, Asia and Europe, 2 focus groups and a literature review of 128 identified high-priority peer reviewed articles. We also analysed 56 interviews from the Ebola 100 project, collected just after the West African Ebola epidemic. Analysis was conducted on gaps and recommendations. These were inductively classified according to various themes during two group prioritization exercises. The project was conducted between February and May 2019. Findings from the report were used to inform strategic prioritization of global investments in social science capacities for health emergencies. Findings Our analysis consolidated 12 knowledge and infrastructure gaps and 38 recommendations from an initial list of 600 gaps and 220 recommendations. In developing our framework, we clustered these into three areas: 1) Recommendations to improve core social science response capacities, including investments in: human resources within response agencies; the creation of social science data analysis capacities at field and global level; mechanisms for operationalizing knowledge; and a set of rapid deployment infrastructures; 2) Recommendations to strengthen applied and basic social sciences, including the need to: better define the social science agenda and core competencies; support innovative interdisciplinary science; make concerted investments in developing field ready tools and building the evidence-base; and develop codes of conduct; and 3) Recommendations for a supportive social science ecosystem, including: the essential foundational investments in institutional development; training and capacity building; awareness-raising activities with allied disciplines; and lastly, support for a community of practice. Interpretation Comprehensively integrating social science into the epidemic preparedness and response architecture demands multifaceted investments on par with allied disciplines, such as epidemiology and virology. Building core capacities and competencies should occur at multiple levels, grounded in country-led capacity building. Social science should not be a parallel system, nor should it be \"siloed\" into risk communication and community engagement. Rather, it should be integrated across existing systems and networks, and deploy interdisciplinary knowledge \"transversally\" across all preparedness and response sectors and pillars. Future work should update this framework to account for the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the institutional landscape.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 6292}
{"label": "NEG", "text": "Introduction: To analyze foveal displacement after macular surgery for idiopathic epiretinal membrane (iERM). Methods: Twenty-eight patients who underwent macular surgery for symptomatic iERM in one eye by one physician were included in this retrospective study. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) volume scans were acquired with a Spectralis OCT device (Heidelberg Spectralis). Using the follow-up view mode, the displacement of the fovea was classified and measured according to its postoperative location in the horizontal and/or vertical plane. Results: One day after surgery, 86% of eyes (24/28) showed foveal displacement. Vertical displacement occurred in a superior direction in 50% eyes, and in an inferior direction in 36% of the eyes. The postoperative mean foveal displacement on the vertical plane was 99 +/- 82 mu m (range, 0-300). Horizontal displacement occurred in a nasal direction in 21%, and temporally in 21%. The postoperative mean foveal displacement on the horizontal plane was 35 +/- 45 mu m (range, 0-123). One year after the macular surgery 69% of the eyes showed still a foveal dislocation. Discussion: Most of the eyes with iERM showed a foveal dislocation after the macular surgery. Our findings emphasize the necessity to carefully study of the OCT images in such eyes after the surgery as the manually determined postoperative foveal position may be in a different vertical or horizontal plane than the machine-generated pre- and postoperative overlay for the foveal position. Our findings may thus be helpful for surgeons to avoid misinterpretation when evaluating OCT images pre- and postoperatively.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 6293}
{"label": "NEG", "text": "INTRODUCTION: Preeclampsia (PE), but mainly preterm PE, is associated with deep placentation disorders. We aimed to compare placental pathologies in pregnancies affected by term and preterm PE compared to normal pregnancies. METHODS: We performed a prospective case-cohort study. Low-risk nulliparous women were recruited in the first trimester and women who developed PE were recruited at diagnosis. Placental pathologies were reported according to the Amsterdam Placental Workshop Group Consensus Statement and were compared between cases and controls. PE cases stratified as term (>= 37 weeks) and preterm PE (<37 weeks). Our primary outcome was maternal vascular malperfusion (MVM). RESULTS: Twenty-four women who developed preterm PE were compared to 10 women who developed term PE and 41 women without PE. Preterm PE (92%) was associated with more MVM than term PE (10%, p < 0.01) and controls (4%, p < 0.01), but the rate of MVM was similar between term PE and controls (p = 0.56). Preterm PE was also associated with more placental infarcts (65% vs. 20% vs. 15%); advanced villous maturation (91% vs. 30% vs. 1%); and hypoplastic villous maturation (70% vs. 10% vs. 3%); and moderate to severe decidual vasculopathy (56% vs. 10% vs. 3%) than term PE and controls (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Most cases of preterm PE are associated with MVM, placental infarcts, advanced and/or hypoplastic villous maturation, and moderate to severe decidual vasculopathy, while it is infrequent in term PE and pregnancies without PE. Preterm and term preeclampsia have a different pathologic process that should be considered for their prevention and clinical management.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 6294}

To test these aggregation rules, a survey adapting the Day Reconstruction Method was conducted in 2017 among 691 travelers to Macau. Our findings reveal that summary evaluations are better predicted using an arithmetic average of all episodic evaluations, instead of the peak-end rule.

Method Adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (n = 58), ankylosing spondylitis (AS) (n = 53), and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) (n = 30), respectively, were included in the study. A single-item visual analog scale (VAS) for loneliness, UCLA Loneliness Scale-8 (ULS-8), Beck depression inventory (BDI), Beck anxiety inventory (BAI), revised multidimensional scale of perceived social support, Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) were used for the psychometric and functional assessments. Multiple regression models were generated for predicting the ULS-8 and HAQ-DI scores. Results There was no difference between disease groups in terms of the ULS-8 and HAQ-DI scores. Among demographic and clinical parameters, only the education status and number of drugs used had associations with the ULS-8 score. Single-item VAS score for loneliness did not predict the ULS-8 score well. There were significant correlations between the ULS-8 and HAQ-DI, depression, anxiety, social support, and physician global VAS scores. Only the education status significantly predicted (beta = -0.208) the ULS-8 score in multiple regression analysis (adjusted R-2 = 0.15, P < .001). Beck depression, anxiety, and patient global VAS scores remained significant for predicting the HAQ-DI after multiple regression with the covariates ULS-8, depression, anxiety, social support, patient and physician global VAS scores, and the number of drugs used (adjusted R-2 = 0.53, P < .001). Disease activity and the ULS-8 scores were not found to be associated in any disease group. Conclusion Loneliness is associated with depression, anxiety, lack of social support, disability, higher number of drugs used, and lower education but not with disease activity in Turkish patients with RA, AS, and PsA.

However, Fisher's Geometric Model (FGM) provides a conceptual foundation to consider the influence of the environment on mutational effects. To quantify mutational properties in the field, we established eight sets of MA lines (7-10 generations) derived from eight founders collected from natural populations of Arabidopsis thaliana from French and Swedish sites, representing the range margins of the species in Europe. We reciprocally planted the MA lines and their founders at French and Swedish sites, allowing us to test predictions of FGM under naturally occurring environmental conditions. The performance of the MA lines relative to each other and to their respective founders confirmed some and contradicted other predictions of the FGM: the contribution of mutation to fitness variance increased when the genotype was in an environment where its fitness was low, that is, in the away environment, but mutations were more likely to be beneficial when the genotype was in its home environment. Consequently, environmental context plays a large role in the contribution of mutations to the evolutionary process and local adaptation does not guarantee that a genotype is at or close to its optimum.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 6328}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "This article presents a balanced tri-band superconducting band-pass filter (BPF) with controllable center frequencies (CFs) and fractional bandwidths (FBWs) using novel double square ring loaded resonators (DSRLRs). Due to the symmetrical structure of the proposed DSRLR, the differential mode (DM), and common mode (CM) equivalent circuits of the resonator are analyzed by using even- and odd-mode methods, and the resonant characteristics can also be obtained. With the proper design of the proposed DSRLR, the first three DM resonant frequencies are utilized to construct the three DM passbands, and their CFs can be adjusted by changing the lengths of the corresponding stubs. Then, the internal coupling between resonators can be controlled independently by the additional capacitive loading microstrip and the interdigital coupling structure. In addition, the so-called frequency dispersion technique is used to enhance CM suppression in the proposed balanced tri-band BPF by loading additional multiple stubs on the symmetry plane. Consequently, the proposed tri-band BPF can realize controllable CFs and FBWs with broadband CM suppression. Prototype balanced filters with CFs of 1.7/2.45/3.4 GHz and FBWs of 2.9%/3.2%/1.8% were designed, manufactured, and measured for verification.

We draw from Indigenous-centered literature, including Bacon's colonial ecological violence, and assert that settler systems, and analyses rooted in settler logics, are inadequate because of their inherent inability to meaningfully and critically engage with colonization. This ignorance causes academic fields of study to be damaged-centred in their gaze on Indigenous peoples, or to ignore or render Indigenous peoples invisible or disappeared.

Our hardware accelerator is based on the 20-stage pipeline and dictionary architecture, highly customized to LZ4 compression algorithm and parallel hardware implementation. Proposing dictionary architecture allows achieving high throughput by comparing input sequences in multiple dictionaries simultaneously compared to a single dictionary. The experimental results provide the high throughput with intensively optimized in the FPGA. Additionally, we compare our implementation to CPU implementation results of LZ4 to provide insights on FPGA-based data centers.

Comparative species delimitation allowed us to delineate putative species without a priori assignment of individuals to nominal species, while genealogical concordance extended our species delimitation results to multiple genes, multiple codistributed species, and comparisons with biogeographic evidence. All species delimitation analyses including two topology-based, one network-based, and one distance-based analysis showed genetically isolated lineages of pipefish in the Black and Caspian Sea, corresponding to S. abaster and S. caspius, respectively. Mean evolutionary divergence between the two lineages (0.029) was within the range separating species of Syngnathus (0.024-0.217). The interclade/intraclade ratio of variation was comparable to the operational criterion of divergence between clades greater or equal to 10 x the level within clades to recognize separate species. Our argument on taxonomic validity of S. caspius is also supported by the principles of genealogical concordance as a conceptual basis for recognition of biological species. As a second objective, using a limited number of S. caspius specimens from two semi-confined water bodies along the Caspian Sea south coastal zone (i.e., Anzali Wetland in the west and Gorgan Bay in the east), we searched for a possible matrilineal structure. The retrieved phylogeographic pattern was characterized by a shallow genealogy and lineage distributions varied, most probably caused by low to modest contemporary gene flow between populations of S. caspius across the southern Caspian Sea that are linked tightly through history.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 6389}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Climate change has caused increasing incidences of the extreme flooding around the world, which has impacted rice production, especially in rainfed ecosystems. Breeding for submergence tolerant rice varieties has been conducted to mitigate the adverse effects and help farmers to reduce yield loss. The present study was carried out to introgress the submergence tolerance QTL (Sub1) from IR64-Sub1 into drought-tolerant lines; UKM5 and UKM91 possessing the drought yield quantitative trait loci (qDTYs), viz. qDTY(12.1) and qDTY(3.1), and to evaluate the effects of the combination of these QTLs in improving the morpho-physiological traits and survival under submergence. UKM5 and UKM91 were selected as the recipient of the Sub1 locus because of the intermediate submergence tolerance they possessed even though they only have qDTY/s. Therefore, the introgression of Sub1 into these lines was hypothesised to enhance survival. Submergence stress was given for 14 days to BC1F4 lines from the two breeding populations. Lines with better survival than the tolerant check, IR64-Sub1 were selected and evaluated under 18 days of submergence stress. Generally, lines with Sub1 and qDTYs from UKM5*/IR64-Sub1 and UKM91*/IR64-Sub1 populations had higher survival rate (SR) of 90-100%, lower shoot elongation percentage (EP) and a smaller percentage of chlorophyll content change (CCC) than IR64-Sub1. The selected lines also showed a low percentage of non-structural carbohydrate change (NSCC) which related to the ability to recover after submergence. In both populations, the interaction of qDTY(3.1) with Sub1 proved to give the best improvement on EP and CCC. This experiment provides novel findings; that is, the combinations of Sub1 + qDTY(12.1) + qDTY(3.1) showed high survival rate in the population of UKM5*/IR64-Sub1, while qDTY(3.1) improved SR of the lines from UKM91*/IR64-Sub1 population to 100%. These results proved that the action of Sub1, qDTY/s and their interaction differ in contrasting population or background. The QTL combinations showed a consistent effect in both submergence experiments and proved the effectiveness of Sub1 and qDTYs combinations in enhancing the morpho-physiological traits and survival.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 6412}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Background. The global crisis situation caused by SARS-CoV-2 has created an explosive demand for ventilators, which cannot be met even in developed countries. Designing a simple and inexpensive device with the ability to increase the number of patients that can be connected to existing ventilators would have a major impact on the number of lives that could be saved. We conducted a study to determine whether two pigs with significant differences in size and weight could be ventilated simultaneously using a single ventilator connected to a new medical device called DuplicAR?. Methods. Six pigs (median weight 12 kg, range 9-25 kg) were connected in pairs to a single ventilator using the new device for 6 hours. Both the ventilator and the device were manipulated throughout the experiment according to the needs of each animal. Tidal volume and positive end-expiratory pressure were individually controlled with the device. Primary and secondary outcome variables were defined to assess ventilation and hemodynamics in all animals throughout the experiment. Results. Median difference in weight between the animals of each pair was 67% (range: 11-108). All animals could be successfully oxygenated and ventilated for 6 hours through manipulation of the ventilator and the DuplicAR (R) device, despite significant discrepancies in body size and weight. Mean PaCO2 in arterial blood was 42.1 +/- 4.4 mmHg, mean PaO2 was 162.8 +/- 46.8 mmHg, and mean oxygen saturation was 98 +/- 1.3%. End-tidal CO2 values showed no statistically significant difference among subjects of each pair. Mean difference in arterial PaCO2 measured at the same time in both animals of each pair was 4.8 +/- 3 mmHg, reflecting the ability of the device to ventilate each animal according to its particular requirements. Independent management of PEEP was achieved by manipulation of the device controllers. Conclusion. It is possible to ventilate two lung-healthy animals with a single ventilator according to each one's needs through manipulation of both the ventilator and the DuplicAR? device. This gives this device the potential to expand local ventilators surge capacity during disasters or pandemics until emergency supplies can be delivered from central stockpiles.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 6425}

Design/methodology/approach Drawing on the theory of planned behaviour (TPB), the authors develop a model and test hypotheses about the factors (1) SE, (2) attitude toward SCF, (3) social influence (SI), (4) adoption intention (AI) and (5) actual adoption (AA) of SCF. Data collected from a survey of 211 managers in SMEs in China were used to conduct a partial least squares (PLS) estimation. Findings The empirical results indicate that attitude toward SCF and SI positively affect AI towards SCF, whereas AI positively affects the AA of SCF. Specifically, the authors find that AI plays a mediating role in the relationship between SE and AA of SCF, whereas attitude toward SCF plays a mediating role between SI and AI. Originality/value First, the authors use the TPB to study the adoption of SCF in SMEs. Second, the authors apply PLS to clarify the influence mechanism of behavioural factors on the adoption of SCF. The authors provide a useful approach for practitioners in examining the adoption of SCF by SMEs.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 6446}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most widespread neurodegenerative diseases. However, the currently available treatments could only relieve symptoms. Novel therapeutic targets are urgently needed. Several previous studies mentioned that protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) acted as a negative regulator of the insulin signal pathway and played a significant role in the inflammation process. However, few studies have investigated the role of PTP1B in the central nervous system. Our study showed that suramin, an inhibitor of PTP1B, could improve neuronal damage. It could significantly attenuate the interferon-gamma-induced upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, including inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappa B). It enhanced M2 type microglia markers, such as arginase-1 and Ym-1 in BV2 murine microglial cells. PTP1B inhibition also reversed 6-hydroxydopamine- (6-OHDA-) induced downregulation of phospho-cAMP response element-binding protein (p-CREB) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in SH-SY5Y cells. Besides, we knocked down and overexpressed PTP1B in the SH-SY5Y cells to confirm its role in neuroprotection. We also verified the effect of suramin in the zebrafish PD model. Treatment with suramin could significantly reverse 6-OHDA-induced locomotor deficits and improved tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) via attenuating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress biomarkers. These results support that PTP1B could potentially regulate PD via antineuroinflammation and antiapoptotic pathways.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 6450}

Described a nanoparticulate mineralized collagen glycosaminoglycan (MC-GAG) material capable of inducing in vivo skull regeneration without exogenous growth factors or ex vivo progenitor cell-priming is described previously. Here, the contribution of titrating stiffness to osteogenicity is evaluated by comparing noncrosslinked (NX-MC) and crosslinked (MC) forms of MC-GAG. While both materials are osteogenic, MC demonstrates an increased expression of osteogenic markers and mineralization compared to NX-MC. Both materials are capable of autogenously activating the canonical BMPR signaling pathway with phosphorylation of Smad1/5. However, unlike NX-MC, human mesenchymal stem cells cultured on MC demonstrate significant elevations in the major mechanotransduction mediators YAP and TAZ expression, coincident with beta-catenin activation in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. Inhibition of YAP/TAZ activation reduces osteogenic expression, mineralization, and beta-catenin activation in MC, with less of an effect on NX-MC. YAP/TAZ inhibition also results in a reciprocal increase in Smad1/5 phosphorylation and BMP2 expression. The results indicate that increasing MC-GAG stiffness induces osteogenic differentiation via the mechanotransduction mediators YAP/TAZ and the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, whereas the canonical BMPR signaling pathway is activated independent of stiffness.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 6455}

This article explores the complex relationship between trade and trust in the context of contested statehood. Most de facto states are heavily dependent on an external patron for economic aid and investment. However, we challenge the widespread assumption that de facto states are merely hapless pawns in the power-play of their patrons. Such an approach fails to capture the conflict dynamics involved. Drawing on a case study of Abkhazia, we explore how this de facto state navigates between its \"patron\"Russia, its \"parent state\"Georgia, and the EU. The conflict transformation literature has highlighted the interrelationship between trust and trade - but how does this unfold in the context of continued nonrecognition and contested statehood? Does trade serve to facilitate trust and hence prospects for conflict transformation? With Abkhazia, we find scant correlation between trust and trade: in the absence of formal recognition, trade does not necessarily facilitate trust. However, the interrelationship between trade, trust, and recognition proves more complex than expected: we find less trust in the patron and more trade with the parent than might have been anticipated.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 6488}

The use of UV-C light in the treatment of platelets has become a valuable method for preserving the efficacy of platelet concentrates in blood banks. However, its deleterious effect remains, such as the activation of platelets, thus causing the platelets to lose their physiological function. In this study, we intended to demonstrate the impact of UV-C on platelets and how the use of glutamine could mitigate the loss of physiological function of the platelets caused by UV-C. Materials and Methods. This study was conducted using mouse platelets. We assessed calcium signaling using Fura-2 AM incubation and dense granule secretion of the platelets using luminescence assay by measuring ATP. At the molecular level, the activation of integrin using PAC-1 antibody was analyzed. Phosphorylation of immune-precipitated cPLA2 was assessed using a specific antibody. All the experiments were carried out with or without glutamine in the presence of UV-C. Positive and negative controls were used in all experiments to validate the findings. Results. We have demonstrated that physiological and biochemical damage arises as a result of the exposure of platelet concentrate to UV-C and that the use of glutamine could alleviate this damage. Various experiments, thrombus formation, integrin activation, and phosphorylation of cPLA2 were preserved using 50 mM of glutamine in the presence of UV-C, which reduces 50% of platelet viability. Conclusions. Our study demonstrates that the storage of platelet concentrates under the UV-C activates their physiological process and renders them to the thrombus formation, hence decreasing their viability. The presence of a moderate amount of glutamine can alleviate the toxic effect of UV-C, and platelet concentrates could be kept viable for a long time.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 6495}

The biology of MGA is poorly understood. In this study, eight MGA cases (n = 4 with and n = 4 without associated BC) were subjected to a comprehensive characterization using immunohistochemistry, genome-wide DNA copy number (CN) profiling, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), next-generation sequencing (NGS), and DNA methylation profiling using 850 K arrays and bisulfite pyrosequencing. Median patient age was 61 years (range 57-76 years). MGA lesions were estrogen receptor (ER)-negative, progesterone receptor-negative, HER2-negative, and S100-positive. DNA CN alterations (CNAs) were complex or limited to few gains and losses. CN gain on chromosome 2q was the most common CNA and was validated by FISH in five of eight cases. NGS demonstrated an average of two mutations per case (range 0-5) affecting 10 different genes (ARID1A, ATM, CTNNB1, FBXW7, FGFR2, MET, PIK3CA, PMS2, PTEN, and TP53). CNAs and mutations were similar in MGA and adjacent BC, indicating clonal relatedness. DNA methylation profiling identified aberrant hypermethylation of CpG sites within GATA3, a key transcription factor required for luminal differentiation. Immunohistochemistry showed regular GATA3 protein expression in the normal mammary epithelium and in ER-positive BC. Conversely, GATA3 was reduced or lost in all MGA cases tested (8/8). In conclusion, MGA is characterized by common CN gain on chromosome 2q and loss of GATA3.

Whether deployed by state or non-state actors, digital devices are rolled out despite intense criticism and controversy.

Experimentality was initially formulated in the anthropological literature on the globalisation of clinical trials and, more recently, revisited in feminist science and technology studies. Drawing on this work, I argue that experimentality has become a rationality of governing in borderzones, which renders social relations continuously decomposable and recomposable by inserting mundane (digital) devices into the world. The introduction of various digital devices in Greece since 2015, starting with Skype for the pre-registration of asylum seekers, helps shed light on a particular form of governing through experiments without protocol. This form of experimentality has specific political effects for migrants' lives. Firstly, experimentality builds upon and intensifies neoliberalism by rearranging rather than redressing precarity. In so doing, experimentality through digital devices produces debilitation rather than better connectivity or access to asylum. Secondly, migrants become not only subjects of surveillance, but subjects of extraction of 'surplus data' which entangles their lives into the circuits of digital platforms.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 6501}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "OBJECTIVE This discussion paper describes the intricacies of the strong Black woman (SBW) construct and how understanding this construct is significant and relevant within nursing. METHOD This article is a discussion piece that provides a succinct conceptual and historical overview of the SBW construct. It then describes the impacts of this construct before presenting implications as they relate to nursing practice, education, policy, and research. RESULTS The SBW construct is exclusively and routinely applied to Black women. Typically, the SBW construct encompasses five components, which center on independence, caring, and strength. These five components include the obligation to (1) always maintain and present an image of strength, (2) suppress emotion, (3) be self-reliant, (4) succeed despite all odds, and (5) always place the needs [especially comfort] of others above those of oneself. Moreover, the SBW construct posits Black women as possessing superhuman capabilities. The nature of this construct is complex, with some Black women using it as a survival mechanism, and others finding empowerment through this image. Nevertheless, recent research has revealed the harms associated with this image including detriment to physical, mental, and spiritual well-being, with the implications extending to Black families and communities. CONCLUSION Understanding this topic is essential in providing support to all Black women in health care and within the Black community-including patients, nurses, faculty, staff, and students. Recognizing the implications of the SBW construct is essential toward ensuring that our care, practices, and policies are not only supportive but also antiracist.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 6505}

In responding to the first of these questions, I argue that working with queer theologies can offer sex education researchers another way of thinking about, and with, theology - one that resists positioning theology as inevitably heteronormative through its attention to the body, embraces the multiple possibilities of queer subjecthood, and attends to the importance of context in understanding how heteronormativity is both reproduced and resisted. Following this, I turn to the second question animating this paper, suggesting that if we are to avoid sex education sliding into an inevitable expression of queer theological commitment, what is needed is a methodology for the translation for sex education research, in which queer theologies can 'meet' with sex education without at the same time 'merging' with it.

In the last few years, several clinical reports identified the lung as one of the key target organs of IFN-mediated inflammation. The major pulmonary patterns described comprise children's interstitial lung diseases (including diffuse alveolar haemorrhages) and pulmonary arterial hypertension but diagnosis may be challenging. Respiratory symptoms may be either mild or absent at disease onset and variably associated with systemic or organ specific inflammation. In addition, associated extrapulmonary clinical features may precede lung function impairment by years, and patients may display severe/endstage lung involvement, although this may be clinically hidden during the long-term disease course. Conversely, a few cases of atypical severe lung involvement at onset have been reported without clinically manifested extrapulmonary signs. Hence, a multidisciplinary approach involving pulmonologists, paediatricians and rheumatologists should always be considered when a monogenic interferonopathy is suspected.

{"label": "NEG", "text": "The intersection collision warning system (ICWS) is an emerging technology designed to assist drivers in avoiding collisions at intersections. ICWS has an excellent performance in reducing the number of collisions and improving driving safety. Previous studies demonstrated that when visibility was low under fog conditions, ICWS could help drivers timely detect hazardous conflicting vehicles. However, the influences of ICWS on interactive driving behavior at unsignalized intersection between different vehicles have barely been discussed. This study aimed to investigate the patterns of drivers' interactive behaviors with the assistance of a new kind of ICWS under fog conditions based on Multiuser Driving Simulation. The Multiuser Driving Simulation allowed multiple drivers to operate in the same simulation scenario at the same time, and it could capture drivers' interactions preferably. Forty-eight licensed drivers completed the driving simulation experiment in three fog conditions (no fog, light fog, and heavy fog) and two warning conditions (warning and no warning), in which the drivers drove in a straight-moving situation at unsignalized intersection with potential collision risks caused by the encounter of two vehicles. The results verified that warning and fog conditions were significant factors that affected the interactive driving behavior in the unsignalized intersection collision avoidance process, including the driver's decision, TTC of action point, average acceleration (deceleration) rate, and postencroachment time. Compared to conditions without ICWS, the ICWS could help drivers make collision avoidance actions earlier and change the speed more smoothly. In addition, with the help of Multiuser Driving Simulation, associations between decision driving behaviors of vehicles were discussed with caution. The results revealed the decision-making mechanism of drivers in the process of interaction with other drivers. Under the influence of fog, interactive driving processes were fraught with increased risk at unsignalized intersection. However, the ICWS helped drivers interact more harmoniously, safely, and efficiently. The findings shed some light on the further development of ICWS and the study on interactive driving behavior.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 6526}

Cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN) is a common and serious complication of diabetes mellitus with various systemic involvements, such as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. We aimed to evaluate the association between CAN and coronary artery lesions in patients with type 2 diabetes. Research Design and Methods. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 104 patients with type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease (CAD). We evaluated heart rate variability (HRV) parameters (SDANN, SDNN, and pNN50) to assess cardiac autonomic function. The severity of coronary lesions was assessed by the Gensini scores and the number of affected vessels. Correlation analyses between HRV parameters and the severity of coronary lesions and clinical parameters were performed. Results. Spearman's correlation analysis showed a significant negative correlation between SDANN and Gensini scores (r=-0.22, P=0.03). Interestingly, this finding remained significant after adjusting for clinical covariates (r=-0.23, P=0.03). However, there was no association between HRV parameters and the severity of coronary lesions as assessed by the number of affected vessels. Clinical parameters were not significantly correlated with HRV parameters (all P>0.05). Conclusions. Cardiac autonomic neuropathy might be related to the degree of coronary atheromatous burden in patients with type 2 diabetes. Screening for cardiac autonomic neuropathy might potentially be beneficial in the risk stratification of patients with type 2 diabetes.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 6527}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Background Gait disturbance is an early, disabling feature of Parkinson's disease (PD) that is typically refractory to dopaminergic medication. The cortical cholinergic system, originating in the nucleus basalis of Meynert of the basal forebrain, has been implicated. However, it is not known if degeneration in this region relates to a worsening of disease-specific gait impairment. Objective To evaluate associations between sub-regional cholinergic basal forebrain volumes and longitudinal progression of gait impairment in PD. Methods 99 PD participants and 47 control participants completed gait assessments via an instrumented walkway during 2 minutes of continuous walking, at baseline and for up to 3 years, from which 16 spatiotemporal characteristics were derived. Sub-regional cholinergic basal forebrain volumes were measured at baseline via MRI and a regional map derived from post-mortem histology. Univariate analyses evaluated cross-sectional associations between sub-regional volumes and gait. Linear mixed-effects models assessed whether volumes predicted longitudinal gait changes. Results There were no cross-sectional, age-independent relationships between sub-regional volumes and gait. However, nucleus basalis of Meynert volumes predicted longitudinal gait changes unique to PD. Specifically, smaller nucleus basalis of Meynert volume predicted increasing step time variability (P = 0.019) and shortening swing time (P = 0.015); smaller posterior nucleus portions predicted shortening step length (P = 0.007) and increasing step time variability (P = 0.041). Conclusions This is the first study to demonstrate that degeneration of the cortical cholinergic system predicts longitudinal progression of gait impairments in PD. Measures of this degeneration may therefore provide a novel biomarker for identifying future mobility loss and falls. (c) 2020 The Authors.

Based on the project of new metro line in Beijing where the shield tunnel was constructed under existing tunnel, a modified equivalent stiffness model for the existing tunnel is proposed. Based on this, a three-dimensional finite element is established, and subsequently the proposed modified equivalent stiffness model and the previous model are implemented into the finite element model (FEM), respectively, and then the effectiveness of it is verified through comparison with the field measurements. The results indicate that the modified equivalent stiffness model has excellent agreement with the monitoring value. The impacts of key parameters including undercrossing angle, vertical spacing, and soil parameters on the crown settlement of the existing tunnel are investigated. The maximum settlement of the existing tunnel crown decreases as the undercrossing angle increases. The decease of vertical spacing between the newly constructed tunnel and the existing tunnel leads to an increase of the peak value of crown settlement. As for the soil parameters, friction angle phi is the dominant parameter affecting crown settlement of the existing tunnel whereas the cohesion c is least influential. During the process of route selection, it is suggested to keep the vertical spacing between new tunnel and the existing tunnel greater than the external diameter of the new metro tunnel. For the situation of undercrossing an existing tunnel within an extremely small clearance, it is recommended to strengthen the soil as necessary.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 6545}

In a pandemic, providers may need such support but with the high risk of exposure, such a program is offered only virtually.

The virtual platform is heralded as the responsible way to provide support in a pandemic but this standard may be ineffective and is inherently inequitable. As a global event, pandemics require containment strategies applicable on an international level; therefore, psychosocial support should also be developed with an international audience in mind. Online psychosocial support falls short of being such a strategy as it incorrectly assumes global internet access. Many low-income areas such as Sub-Saharan Africa will need support strategies which compliment local frontline staff and fit with community-driven initiatives, whereas wealthier countries may use a combination of onsite and online support.

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Background Comparing the distribution of all cause or cause-specific child mortality in countries by income and its progress over time has not been rigorously monitored, and hence remains unknown. We therefore aimed to analyze child mortality disparities between countries with respect to income level and progression for the period 2000-2015, and further explored the convergence of unequal income levels across the globe. Methods Four types of measures were used to assess the degree of inequality across countries: difference and ratio of child mortality rate, the concentration index, and the Erreygers index. To assess the longitudinal trend of unequal child mortality rate by wealth ranking, hierarchical mixed effect analysis was used to examine any significant changes in the slope of under-5 child mortality rate by GDP per capita between 2000 and 2015. Results All four measures reveal significant inequalities across the countries by income level. Compared with children in the least deprived socioeconomic quintile, the mortality rate for children in the most deprived socioeconomic quintile was nearly 20.7 times higher (95% Confidence Interval: 20.5-20.8) in 2000, and 12.2 times (95% CI: 12.1-12.3) higher in 2015. Globally, the relative and absolute inequality of child mortality between the first and fifth quintiles have declined over time in all diseases, but was more pronounced for infectious diseases (pneumonia, diarrhea, measles, and meningitis). In 2000, post-neonatal children in the first quintile had 105.3 times (95% CI: 100.8-110.0) and 216.3 times (95% CI: 202.5-231.2) higher risks of pneumonia- and diarrhea-specific child mortality than children in the fifth quintile. In 2015, the corresponding rate ratios had decreased to 59.3 (95% CI: 56.5-62.1) and 101.9 (95% CI: 94.3-110.0) times. However, compared with non-communicable disease, infectious diseases still show a far more severe disparity between income quintile. Mixed effect analysis demonstrates the convergence of under-5 mortality in 194 countries across income levels. Conclusion Grand convergence in child mortality, particularly in post neonatal children, suggests that the global community has witnessed success to some extent in controlling infectious diseases. To our knowledge, this study is the first to assess worldwide inequalities in cause-specific child mortality and its time trend by wealth.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 6567}

Seven patients (2-14 years; median 6 years) were diagnosed with thalassemia (n = 4), acute myeloid leukemia (n = 2), and pure red cell aplasia. Three, two, and two patients received Bu at 1.1, 1.2, and 0.8 mg/kg, respectively. The AUC of Bu varied from 292-1714 mu M min (median = 804).

However, the influence of cola on the corrosion resistance of passive film of TiA10 alloy restorative materials is rarely reported. The purpose of this study was to analysis the corrosion resistance, composition of the passive film of TA10 alloy in different concentrations of Cola. Design/methodology/approach The passive behavior of TA10 alloy in artificial saliva (AS) and Cola was studied by means of potentiodynamic polarization, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, Mott-Schottky techniques and combined with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) surface analysis. Findings With the increase of cola content, the self-corrosion current density of the alloy increases sharply, and the corrosion resistance of the passive film is the best in AS, while Rp in cola is reduced to half of that in AS. The thickness of the passive film in AS, AS +cola and cola is about 9.5 nm, 7.5 nm and 6 nm, respectively. The passive film in cola has more defects and the carrier density is 1.55 times as high as that in AS. Cola can weaken the formation process of the protected oxide, promote the formation of high valence Ti-oxides and increase the content of Mo-oxides in the passive film.

The relaxation of component chains accelerates on all length scales as increasing the free volume available to monomers to move, with the dependence of mobility shift on composition being quantified by a Williams-Landel-Ferry like function governing the time-composition superposition.

This model would aid in understanding and mitigating excessive SOC loss (SOCL) on the Loess Plateau, where severe erosion occurs. To construct such a model, we established five study plots of similar slope in the Loess Plateau: four experimental vegetation successional communities and one bare land control. An in situ field scouring experiment was carried out to measure and analyze soil erosion, hydraulic parameters, and SOCL. The first scour saw the greatest increase in sediment concentration (0.007 g ml(-1)) and sediment amount (2.886 kg) and the most significant SOC loss (8.361 g). Further scouring in each plot decreased total SOCL. The factors affecting SOCL included soil erodibility (median particle size, sediment concentration, total sediment loss, SOC concentration, total SOCL) and hydrodynamics (runoff depth, power, velocity, and shear force), which accounted for 93 and 29% of SOCL. Flow velocity, especially 2 m from the bottom of the transition section (L2), was most closely correlated to SOC concentration (0.681; P < .05). Flow velocity affects selective migration of sand in sediment, thus affecting SOC concentration. We based our sediment and SOCL model on observed hydrodynamics, including V2 (flow velocity at L2) in said model. Predicted values supported measured values more precisely (R-2( )> .98). Our findings and developed model aid in predicting SOCL on slopes during severe erosion events.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 6602}

To minimize bias from student sorting by type of instructor, we combine course-set fixed effects with an instrumental variables approach that exploits term-by-term fluctuations in faculty composition in each department, therefore controlling for both between- and within-course sorting. The findings suggest that two-year students, particularly racial minority students, have substantially higher levels of exposure to adjuncts with temporary appointments than four-year students. Two-year students taking a heavy course schedule with temporary adjuncts are adversely affected in college persistence and subsequent credit accumulation, and the penalty is particularly pronounced among males and racial minority students with stronger academic potential. Such negative impacts on academic outcomes do not translate into poorer short- to medium-term labor market performance.

The purpose of this study was to test whether greater times and nights of patient hospitalization (proxies for partner exposure to hospital stressors) are prospectively associated with greater increases in partner depression and in partner self-reported poor health. Participants were 7,490 married couples (11,208 individuals) enrolled in the Health and Retirement Study.

Covariates included age, gender, race, ethnicity, income, own hospitalization experiences during the past 12 months, and one's own and spouse comorbidities. Having a spouse who experienced two or more hospitalizations was associated with an increase in one's own depression over time, as was having a spouse who spent eight or more nights in-hospital.

It is argued that diachronically well has developed from its etymological meaning ('in a good way') on a cline of adverbialization to an intensifier and to a discourse marker. Well is replaced by other intensifiers in the fourteenth century but emerges in new uses in Present-Day English. The changes in frequency and use of the new intensifier are explored on the basis of a twenty-year time gap between the old British National Corpus (1994) and the new Spoken British National Corpus (2014). The results show that well increases in frequency over time and that it spreads to new semantic types of adjectives and participles, and is found above all in predicative structures with a copula.

In this study, survey data were used to examine the effect of adoption of adaptation strategies comprising irrigation, soil conservation, and enhanced cropping calendar management, on farm performance and multi-dimensional poverty index. Multinomial Endogenous Treatment Effect (METE) model which accounts for selectivity bias due to both observed and unobserved factors was employed. The results showed that a higher crop output and a greater reduction in downside risk exposure were associated with adoption of adaptation strategies as a package. The results further revealed that using all three strategies led to a significant reduction in multi-dimensional poverty among adapters. This suggests that adaptation is not only an ex-ante strategy against risk exposure, but an effective means of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.

A sociodemographic and clinical questionnaire, the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire, the Pain Catastrophizing Scale, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Chronic Pain Coping Inventory, the Short Form Health Survey, and the Brief Pain Inventory were completed by 103 patients with chronic pain. Greater use of wellness-focused coping and being professionally active were associated with better physical QoL. Cognitive representations and illness-focused coping contributed to physical QoL, and psychological morbidity contributed to mental QoL. Illness-focused coping and wellness-focused coping moderated the relationship between pain interference and physical QoL, but not with mental QoL. Since pain interference was positively related to psychological morbidity, and the latter was negatively related to QoL, it is extremely important to evaluate and promote patients' coping strategies that are focused on well-being to improve QoL.

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Purpose This paper aims to study the hub transportation system in supply chain networks which would contribute to reducing costs and environmental pollution, as well as to economic development and social responsibility. As not all customers tend to buy green products, several customer groups should be considered in terms of need type. Design/methodology/approach In this paper, a multi-objective hub location problem is developed for designing a sustainable supply chain network based on customer segmentation. It deals with the aspects of economic (cost reduction), environment (minimizing greenhouse gas emissions by the transport sector) and social responsibility (creating employment and community development). The epsilon-constraint method and augmented epsilon-constraint (AEC) method are used to solve the small-sized instances of this multi-objective problem. Due to the non-deterministic polynomial-time hardness of this problem, two non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) and multi-objective grey wolf optimizer (MOGWO) metaheuristic algorithms are also applied to tackle the large-sized instances of this problem. Findings As expected, the AEC method is able to provide better Pareto solutions according to the goals of the decision-makers. The Taguchi method was used for setting the parameters of the two metaheuristic algorithms. Considering the meaningful difference, the MOGWO algorithm outperforms the NSGA-II algorithm according to the rate of achievement to two objectives simultaneously and the spread of non-dominance solutions indexes. Regarding the other indexes, there was no meaningful difference between the performance of the two algorithms. Practical implications The model of this research provides a comprehensive solution for supply chain companies that want to achieve a rational balance between the three aspects of sustainability. Originality/value The importance of considering customer diversity on the one hand and saving on hub transportation costs, on the other hand, triggered us to propose a hub location model for designing a sustainable supply chain network based on customer segmentation.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 6664}

To date, the molecular mechanism of TMJOA pathogenesis remains unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the biological function of the micro-ribonucleic acid 101a-3p (miR-101a-3p) and its role in TMJOA. Methods We detected the effect of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) on chondrocyte proliferation using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) technology. Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), we detected transcription levels of miR-101a-3p in a rat model with TMJOA and inflamed chondrocytes, as well as in a group of normal rats. The effect of miR-101a-3p on apoptosis was examined in vitro using flow cytometry (FCM). We then analyzed the target of miR-101a-3p via bioinformatics and confirmed it using a luciferase reporter assay (LRA). Results We showed that IL-1 beta could inhibit proliferation of chondrocytes. We found that miR-101a-3p levels were significantly lower in the rat inflammation model with TMJOA and inflamed chondrocytes than in the normal group. Additionally, miR-101a-3p substantially promoted apoptosis of chondrocytes, and both bioinformatic analyses and LRA found that this miRNA targeted the genes ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 2D1 (UBE2D1) and Frizzled class receptor 4 (FZD4).

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Background This paper seeks to contribute to a reputable evidence base for required competencies across different topics in statistics and probability (statistical topics) in preparing medical graduates for clinical practice. This is in order to inform the prioritization of statistical topics within future undergraduate medical curricula, while exploring the need for preparing tomorrow's doctors to be producers, and not merely consumers, of statistics. Methods We conducted a comprehensive online survey from July 2013 to August 2014 for a target group of 462 medical graduates with current or prior experience of teaching undergraduate medical students of the University of Edinburgh of whom 278 (60.2%) responded. Statistical topics were ranked by proportion of respondents who identified the practice of statistics, performing statistical procedures or calculations using appropriate data, as a required competency for medical schools to provide in preparing undergraduate medical students for clinical practice. Mixed effects analyses were used to identify potential predictors for selection of the above competency and to compare the likelihood of this selection for a range of statistical topics versus critical appraisal. Results Evidence was gleaned from medical graduates' experiences of clinical practice for the need for, not only a theoretical understanding of statistics and probability but also, the ability to practice statistics. Nature of employment and statistical topic were highly significant predictors of choice of the practice of statistics as a required competency ((F = 3.777, p < 0.0005) and (F = 45.834, p < 0.0005), respectively). The most popular topic for this competency was graphical presentation of data (84.3% of respondents) in contrast to cross-over trials for the competency understanding the theory only (70.5% of respondents). Several topics were found to be more popular than critical appraisal for competency in the practice of statistics. Conclusions The model of medical graduates as mere consumers of statistics is oversimplified. Contrary to what has been suggested elsewhere, statistical learning opportunities in undergraduate medicine should not be restricted to development of critical appraisal skills. Indeed, our findings support development of learning opportunities for undergraduate medical students as producers of statistics across a wide range of statistical topics.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 6674}

Therefore, in this paper the main aim is to identify whether in times of crisis the development of frugal innovation in emerging markets depends on the bricolage capability. Design/methodology/approach The hypotheses were statistically tested using the structural equation modeling technique, with data collected through the survey method applied to 215 companies in Brazil. Findings The results allowed support for the hypothesis that bricolage capability has a positive impact on the development of frugal innovation. Therefore, a mediating test was verified, allowing confirmation that to develop frugal innovation in emerging markets, bricolage becomes a required capability for companies in times of crisis. Research limitations/implications The limitation of this study lies in considering the effect of bricolage on frugal innovation only in the context of Brazil, while in developed countries this effect may be similar, as they also suffer from resource constraints caused by crises. Practical implications This research provides insights to guide managers by highlighting bricolage as a key managerial capability for the development of frugal innovation. A set of managerial recommendations are provided based on bricolage skills. Originality/value The study has contributed to the literature on bricolage and frugal innovation by addressing bricolage as an antecedent of frugal innovation in emerging markets, especially when those markets are affected by resource scarcity.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 6685}

The increased use of pesticides to control FAW in Africa raises concerns for health and environmental risks resulting in a growing interest in research on biological control options for smallholder farmers. In order to evaluate the occurrence of local natural enemies attacking FAW, we collected on a weekly basis FAW eggs and larvae during a maize crop cycle in the rainy season of 2018-2019 at four locations in the Lusaka and Central provinces in Zambia. A total of 4373 larvae and 162 egg masses were collected. For each location and date of collection, crop stage, the number of plants checked and amount of damage were recorded to analyse which factors best explain the occurrence of the natural enemy species on maize. Overall parasitism rates from local natural enemies at each location varied between 8.45% and 33.11%. We identified 12 different egg-larval, larval and larval-pupal parasitoid species. Location, maize growth stage, pest density and larval stage significantly affected parasitoid species occurrence. Our findings indicate that there is potential for increasing local populations of natural enemies of FAW through conservation biological control programmes and develop safe and practical control methods for smallholder farmers.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 6691}

The key benefit of the IoHT platform is the ease of time-independent interaction from geographically distant locations by offering preventive or proactive healthcare services at a lower cost. The communication, integration, computation, and interoperability in IoHT are provided by various low-power biomedical sensors equipped with limited computational capabilities. Therefore, conventional cryptographic solutions are not feasible for the majority of IoHT applications. In addition, executing computing-intensive tasks will lead to a slow response time that can deteriorate the performance of IoHT. We strive to resolve such a deficiency, and thus a new scheme has been proposed in this article, called an online-offline signature scheme in certificateless settings. The scheme divides the signing part into two phases, i.e., online and offline. In the absence of a message, the offline phase performs computationally intensive tasks, while lighter computations are executed in the online phase when there is a message. Security analyses and comparisons with the respective existing schemes are carried out to show the feasibility of the proposed scheme. The results obtained authenticate that the proposed scheme offers enhanced security with lower computational and communication costs.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 6714}

In recent years, miRNAs have been shown to positively impact the production capacity of recombinant CHO cells, especially with regard to difficult to express proteins. Effective and reliable gene regulation of process relevant target genes by miRNAs is a prerequisite for integrating them into the toolbox of industrial cell engineering strategies. However, most studies rely on transient transfection of miRNA mimics; there is low standardization in evaluation of miRNA function and little knowledge on transferability of effects found during transient expression to stable expression during industry relevant fed-batch cultivation. In order to provide more insight into this topic, we used the pcDNA6.2 vector for stable miRNA overexpression during batch and fed-batch cultivation in CHO DG44 cells, optimized the vector, and compared the miRNA levels and effects with those achieved by transfection of miRNA mimics. We found that miR-1 downregulated TWF1 mRNA in different recombinant CHO DG44 clones in a dose-dependent manner during transient batch cultivation. Cells stably overexpressing miR-1 also showed a TWF1 mRNA downregulation when cultivated in batch mode using in-house medium 1. However, when the cells stably overexpressing miR-1 were cultivated in fed-batch mode using in-house medium 2. Consequently, a change of cultivation mode and medium seems to have an impact on target gene regulation by miRNA.

One such issue is feature or gene selection and identifying relevant and non-redundant marker genes from high dimensional gene expression data sets. In that context, designing an efficient feature selection algorithm exploiting knowledge from multiple potential biological resources may be an effective way to understand the spectrum of cancer or other diseases with applications in specific epidemiology for a particular population. Results In the current article, we design the feature selection and marker gene detection as a multi-view multi-objective clustering problem. Regarding that, we propose an Unsupervised Multi-View Multi-Objective clustering-based gene selection approach called UMVMO-select. Three important resources of biological data (gene ontology, protein interaction data, protein sequence) along with gene expression values are collectively utilized to design two different views. UMVMO-select aims to reduce gene space without/minimally compromising the sample classification efficiency and determines relevant and non-redundant gene markers from three cancer gene expression benchmark data sets. Conclusion A thorough comparative analysis has been performed with five clustering and nine existing feature selection methods with respect to several internal and external validity metrics. Obtained results reveal the supremacy of the proposed method. Reported results are also validated through a proper biological significance test and heatmap plotting.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 6736}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Background and Aim Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) preconditioning drastically augments bactericidal activity but reduces the host inflammatory response. Therefore, it may be beneficial to prevent postoperative infectious complications and mitigate host damage by surgical stress. Considering its clinical application, how LPS preconditioning influences the antitumor effect in the liver is an important issue. We then investigated the effect of LPS preconditioning on antitumor activity against Colon26 tumor cells in mice. Methods Lipopolysaccharide preconditioning was induced in mice by the intraperitoneal injection of 5 mu g/kg LPS for three consecutive days. Intraportal inoculation of Colon26 cells, which express luminescent protein called Nano-lantern, was performed to evaluate the effect of LPS preconditioning on tumor liver metastasis. The antitumor activities of cytotoxic liver lymphocytes, especially natural killer (NK) cells and natural killer T (NKT) cells, against Colon26 cells were also examined in LPS preconditioned mice. Results Lipopolysaccharide preconditioning remarkably prevented liver metastasis of Colon26 cells, as observed by IVIS imaging system, and prolonged survival after tumor inoculation. LPS preconditioning increased the proportions and number of liver NK cells and NKT cells and augmented their intracellular perforin and granzyme B expression, while reducing their intracellular expression of IFN-gamma. An in vitro antitumor cytotoxicity assay revealed that LPS preconditioning significantly augmented antitumor cytotoxicities of the liver NK cells and NKT cells, especially NKT cells, against Colon26 cells. Conclusions Lipopolysaccharide preconditioning potently augmented antitumor cytotoxicity of liver NK cells and NKT cells, thereby improving mouse survival after intraportal inoculation of Colon26 tumor cells.

Thus, we assessed occurrence and effects of infections with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on patients on the Swiss national waiting list for solid organ transplantation. METHODS: Patient data were retrospectively extracted from the Swiss Organ Allocation System (SOAS). From 16 March to 31 May 2020, we included all patients listed for solid organ transplantation on the Swiss national waiting list who were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Severity of COVID-19 was categorised as follows: stage I, mild symptoms; stage II, moderate to severe symptoms; stage III, critical symptoms; stage IV, death. We compared the incidence rate (laboratory-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2), the hospital admission rate (number of admissions of SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals), and the case fatality rate (number of deaths of SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals) in our study population with the general Swiss population during the study period, calculating age-adjusted standardised incidence ratios and standardised mortality ratios, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: A total of 1439 patients were registered on the Swiss national solid organ transplantation waiting list on 31 May 31 2020. Twenty-four (1.7%) waiting list patients were reported to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the study period. The median age was 56 years (interquartile range 45.3-65.8), and 14 (58%) were male. Of all patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, two patients were asymptomatic, 14 (58%) presented in COVID-19 stage I, 3 (13%) in stage II, and 5 (21%) in stage III. Eight patients (33%) were admitted to hospital, four (17%) required intensive care, and three (13%) mechanical ventilation. Twenty-two patients (92%) of all those infected recovered, but two male patients aged >65 years with multiple comorbidities died in hospital from respiratory failure. Comparing our study population with the general Swiss population, the age-adjusted standardised incidence ratio was 4.1 (95% CI 2.7-6.0). CONCLUSION: The overall rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections in candidates awaiting solid organ transplantation was four times higher than in the Swiss general population; however, the frequency of testing likely played a role. Given the small sample size of affected patients, conclusions have to be drawn cautiously and results need verification in larger cohorts.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 6756}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "The ultrasonic annular array transducer usually has a stronger focusing acoustic field than the linear array and matrix transducer with the same number of array elements, and is more suitable for the detection of large thickness and high attenuation components. However, due to the special arrangement of array elements, the focusing beam cannot be deflected and has a large near field, which limits its application in practical detection. The element parameters of annular array transducer are often designed and analyzed according to the 2-D acoustic field model of a linear array transducer. Therefore, the 3-D acoustic field distribution model of the annular array transducer is established, and the influence of the element parameters on its spatial acoustic field focusing characteristics is analyzed. The design criteria of the array element division mode and element size are proposed, which can avoid the generation of high-energy side lobe and grating lobe, and have good axial acoustic field. Then, the influence of excitation aperture on the energy and size of focal spot at different depths is discussed. The dynamic focusing method with variable aperture of annular array is established, and the C-scan detection experiment is carried out on the addictive manufacturing titanium alloy specimen. The detection results show that the variable aperture method has better central amplitude consistency and imaging accuracy for different depth defects, and has better near surface detection ability than the fixed aperture method.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 6760}

Besides this, the habit which they will acquire, by seeking first what is easy, and then passing onward slowly and step by step to the more difficult, will benefit them more than all my instructions. Thus, in my own case, I am persuaded that if I had been taught from my youth all the truths of which I have since sought out demonstrations, and had thus learned them without labour, I should never, perhaps, have known any beyond these; at least, I should never have acquired the habit and the facility which I think I possess in always discovering new truths in proportion as I give myself to the search.", "group": "PHIL", "id": 6784}

Four of five multicooker models examined met the acceptance criteria for the test and one model was selected for inactivation testing. Tests were performed on four different FFR models with SARS-CoV-2 suspended in culture media, simulated saliva or simulated lung fluid. Moist heat treatment reduced recoverable titres of SARS-CoV-2 virus to levels below the limit of detection in all tests. Furthermore, these four FFR models showed no loss in collection efficiency, inhalation resistance or visual damage after up to 10 decontamination cycles.

Although 80-90% of initial loaded protein was immobilized, however, unsatisfactory activity recoveries was obtained in both covalent immobilization and adsorption studies. Entrapping NLase in polyvinyl alcohol allowed us to obtain an immobilized NLase with 80% activity recovery and 100% initial protein recovery. The characterization studies showed that the free and entrapped NLase samples had both maximum activity at pH 7.5 and 30 degrees C. The free nitrilase completely lost its initial activity at 30 degrees C after 24 h pre-incubation. However, the entrapped NLase retained 60% of its initial activity under the same conditions. Acrylonitrile with a initial concentration of 0.1 M was all converted to acrylic acid by entrapped NLase in 30 min whereas the same yield was achieved by soluble enzyme in 60 min. The entrapped NLase retained 84% of its initial activity after 15 reuses for the hydrolysis of acrylonitrile. These results show that the entrapped NLase can be of great interest as a biocatalyst to synthesize acrylic acid under mild reaction conditions.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 6823}

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 disease on urological activity in Tunisia. To assess the differences in the management of urological conditions between the private and the public field. Methods: a survey was addressed to all certified urologists working in Tunisia in both the public and private sectors (n=194) using the national database of active urologists available and updated. We either called them or looked them up through email or social media. The form was open from March the 28 th to April the 3rd. Results were obtained via spreadsheet and analysed using SPSS 23.0. Results: one hundred and twenty urologists have filled in the form. Consultations at the outpatient office were restricted to urgent cases in 66% (n=79). Telemedicine was more used by urologists in private than in public fields p=0.03. Urologists in private sector followed more the sterilization protocol of the hospital/clinic and used more disposable materials whenever possible p=0.011. Elective surgical activity has completely stopped in 85% of the responders (n=102). Elective surgery requiring transfusion or intensive care unit was performed in 38% (n=46) and 26% (n=31) if there was a risk of disease progression. Benign Prostate Hyperplasia (BPH) surgery was more performed as usual in private sector than in public sector p=0.012. It was the only condition managed differently between both sectors. Conclusion: the drop of the urological activity is essential in order to give relevant stakeholders room to act efficiently against the spread of the virus. The context of the pandemic and the hospital's condition must be taken into consideration without compromising the patient's outcome.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 6830}

Also, a significant gap remains in the understanding of which determinants are related to significant psychological symptoms and whether distressed patients require and receive mental care. Methods Adult EoE patients were invited to complete standardized measures on anxiety/depressive symptoms (HADS) and general psychopathology (SCL-90-R). All scores were compared to general population norms. Socio-demographic and clinical factors were assessed. Results In total, 147 adult EoE patients (61% males, age 43 (IQR 29-52) years were included (response rate 71%). No difference with general population values was found for total anxiety and depressive symptoms (7.8 +/- 6.6 vs. 8.4 +/- 6.3; p = 0.31). A total of 38/147(26%) patients reported high levels of anxiety and/or depressive symptoms (HADS-A >= 8: 35/147(24%) and HADS-D >= 8: 14/147(10%)), indicative of a possible psychiatric disorder. In a multivariate analysis, age between 18-35 years was independently associated with high levels of anxiety (HADS-A >= 8) (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.3-6.9; p = 0.01). The SCL-90-R Global Severity Index (GSI) was significantly higher compared to the general population (p < 0.001). Significant signs of general mental distress (GSI >= 80th percentile) were observed in 51(36%) EoE patients, of which 29(57%) patients denied having any mental problems and only 8(16%) patients received mental care. Conclusion A considerable proportion of adult EoE patients suffers from mental distress, with a 3-fold risk of significant anxiety in those patients younger than 35 years. Therefore, population-based studies are required and a proactive approach in the screening for and treatment of these psychological symptoms in EoE practice seems essential.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 6831}

However, bands 24/25 images with spatial resolution of 250 m (hereafter bands 24/25 250-m images) have considerable horizontal stripe noise caused by the limitation of the sensor imaging system's multi-detector parallel scanning and the multiple interferences from space.

Thus, the moment matching method considering synchronous reference image is applied to remove the stripe noise of bands 24/25 250-m images in the land area. Results shows that the moment matching method considering the synchronous reference image can effectively remove the stripe noise in the land area. In addition, quantitative evaluation criteria, such as information entropy H, mean-absolute-error (MAE), and peak signal-to-noise ratio, are better than those of the traditional moment matching method. After destriping, the LST values using MERSI-2 data are retrieved with better effect and decrease by 0.339 and 0.504 K using MAE and root-mean-square error, respectively, in contrast to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer LST product.

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Accurate forecast and simulation of near-surface wind is a great challenge for numerical weather prediction models due to the significant transient and intermittent nature of near-surface wind. Based on the analyses of the impact of assimilating in situ and Advanced Tiros Operational Vertical Sounder (ATOVS) satellite radiance data on the simulation of near-surface wind during a severe wind event, using the new generation mesoscale Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and its three-dimensional variational (3DVAR) data assimilation system, the dynamic downscaling of near-surface wind is further investigated by coupling the microscale California Meteorological (CALMET) model with the WRF and its 3DVAR system. Results indicate that assimilating in situ and ATOVS radiance observations strengthens the airflow across the Alataw valley and triggers the downward transport of momentum from the upper atmosphere in the downstream area of the valley in the initial conditions, thus improving near-surface wind simulations. Further investigations indicate that the CALMET model provides more refined microtopographic structures than the WRF model in the vicinity of the wind towers. Although using the CALMET model achieves the best simulation of near-surface wind through dynamic downscaling of the output from the WRF and its 3DVAR assimilation, the simulation improvements of near-surface wind speed are mainly within 1 m s(-1). Specifically, the mean improvement proportions of near-surface wind speed are 64.8% for the whole simulation period, 58.7% for the severe wind period, 68.3% for the severe wind decay period, and 75.4% for the weak wind period. The observed near-surface wind directions in the weak wind conditions are better simulated in the coupled model with CALMET downscaling than in the WRF and its 3DVAR system. It is concluded that the simulation improvements of CALMET downscaling are distinct when near-surface winds are weak, and the downscaling effects are mainly manifested in the simulation of near-surface wind directions.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 6862}

Health psychologists struggle to find adequate space for taking care of their patients.

Background: The author relates to his work as a health psychologist and psychotherapist in a consultation-liaison psychiatry (CLP) service operating in a general hospital in Lugano (Switzerland). Methods: An autoethnographic method is applied through calling on childhood memories on architecture and analyzing insights regarding the healthcare space in everyday work as a psychologist. Photographs and drawings are employed as evocative material. Results: Autoethnographical data show that building interiors can be a metaphor for an inner dimension. Spaces can be perceived as depersonalized in hospital. Through psychoanalytical theory, it is argued that space becomes ideal for CLP if it can ensure the continuity of the patient's self during hospitalization. Proximity, confidentiality, and privacy are healthcare design requirements to be considered for favoring potential space and psychological intervention.

Head-to-head comparison of treatment failure and costs among chronic obstruct pulmonary disease (COPD) patients who used noninvasive ventilation (NIV) in the ward versus in the ICU is lacking. Methods. This retrospective study was performed in a department of respiratory and critical care medicine in a teaching hospital. COPD patients who used NIV in the respiratory ward or respiratory ICU were screened. We enrolled patients with PaCO2 more than 45 mmHg and pH less than 7.35 before the use of NIV. Results. We enrolled 83 patients who initiated NIV in the ward and 319 patients in the ICU. Only 5 (6%) patients in the ward were required to transfer to ICU for intensive care. The vital signs were worse but improved faster within 24 h of NIV among patients in the ICU than those in the ward. The NIV failure, hospital mortality, and the length of stay in hospital did not differ between the two groups. However, the duration of NIV was shorter (median 4.0 vs. 6.1 days, p<0.01) and hospital costs were higher (median 4638 vs. 3093 $USD, p<0.01) among patients in the ICU than those in the ward. After propensity matching, 42 patients were left in each group, and the baseline data were comparable between the two groups.

Using an object-RAN task, we orthogonally manipulated the word-form frequency and phonological neighborhood density of the object names and assessed the effects on speech and eye movements and their temporal coordination. In both groups, there was a significant interaction between word frequency and neighborhood density: shorter fixations for dense than for sparse neighborhoods were observed for low- but not for high-frequency words. This finding does not suggest a specific difficulty in lexical phonological access in dyslexia. However, in readers with dyslexia only, these lexical effects percolated to the late processing stages, indicated by longer offset eye-speech lags. We close by discussing potential reasons for this finding, including suboptimal specification of phonological representations and deficits in attention control or in multi-item coordination.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 6904}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Signal intensity measured in a mass cytometry (CyTOF) channel can often be affected by the neighboring channels due to technological limitations. Such signal artifacts are known as spillover effects and can substantially limit the accuracy of cell population clustering. Current approaches reduce these effects by using additional beads for normalization purposes known as single-stained controls. While effective in compensating for spillover effects, incorporating single-stained controls can be costly and require customized panel design. This is especially evident when executing large-scale immune profiling studies. We present a novel statistical method, named CytoSpill that independently quantifies and compensates the spillover effects in CyTOF data without requiring the use of single-stained controls. Our method utilizes knowledge-guided modeling and statistical techniques, such as finite mixture modeling and sequential quadratic programming, to achieve optimal error correction. We evaluated our method using five publicly available CyTOF datasets obtained from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), C57BL/6J mouse bone marrow, healthy human bone marrow, chronic lymphocytic leukemia patient, and healthy human cord blood samples. In the PBMCs with known ground truth, our method achieved comparable results to experiments that incorporated single-stained controls. In datasets without ground-truth, our method not only reduced spillover on likely affected markers, but also led to the discovery of potentially novel subpopulations expressing functionally meaningful, cluster-specific markers. CytoSpill (developed in R) will greatly enhance the execution of large-scale cellular profiling of tumor immune microenvironment, development of novel immunotherapy, and the discovery of immune-specific biomarkers.

Design Two group large animal model of CO poisoning. Setting Laboratory. Subjects Ten swine were divided into two groups: Control (n = 4) and CO (n = 6). Interventions Administration of a low dose of CO at 200 ppm to the CO group over 90 min followed by 30 min of re-oxygenation at room air. The Control group received room air for 120 min. Measurements Non-invasive optical monitoring was used to measure cerebral blood flow and oxygenation. Cerebral microdialysis was performed to obtain semi real time measurements of cerebral metabolic status. At the end of the exposure, both fresh brain (cortical and hippocampal tissue) and heart (apical tissue) were immediately harvested to measure mitochondrial respiration and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and blood was collected to assess plasma cytokine concentrations. Main results Animals in the CO group showed significantly decreased Complex IV-linked mitochondrial respiration in hippocampal and apical heart tissue but not cortical tissue. There also was a significant increase in mitochondrial ROS generation across all measured tissue types. The CO group showed a significantly higher cerebral lactate-to-pyruvate ratio. Both IL-8 and TNF alpha were significantly increased in the CO group compared with the Control group obtained from plasma. While not significant there was a trend to an increase in optically measured cerebral blood flow and hemoglobin concentration in the CO group.

Although spatio-temporal changes of groundwater storage (GWS) and its depletion in northern India are mapped using the NASA's GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) records, the sub-regional diverse socio-political and environmental factors contributing to the variability in groundwater withdrawals and renewals are not well documented. Here, we provide new evidence on changes in GWS at different spatial scales using both observations and satellite-based measurements applying both parametric and non-parametric statistical analyses. The substantial loss of GWS has occurred since the beginning of the 21st century, and the decline in GWS is associated with some record-breaking dry and hot climate events. We present how certain state-based policy decisions, such as supplying free electricity for irrigation, prompted farmers to extract groundwater unsustainably and thus led to widespread GWS deletion, which has been also accelerated by frequent dryness and rising temperatures. In the hotspot of Punjab, Haryana and Delhi of northern India, the extracted groundwater during 1985-2013 is equivalent to a metre-high layer if spread uniformly across its geographical domain. We find that the groundwater storage loss in northern India has increased rapidly from 17 km(3) to 189 km(3) between the pre-2002 and 2002-2013 periods. This loss in northern India is, therefore, an excellent example of rapid surface greening and sub-surface drying-a result of an interplay of socio-political and environmental factors.

Particular attention is devoted to the existence of invariant solutions which retain their spatial distributions when the value of the bifurcation parameter changes. Invariant patterns of an equidistant economy under the replicator dynamics are obtained. The mechanism of bifurcations from these patterns is elucidated. The stability of bifurcating branches is analyzed to demonstrate that most of them are unstable immediately after bifurcation. Numerical analysis of spatial economic models confirms that almost all bifurcating branches are unstable. Direct bifurcating curves connect the curves of invariant solutions, thereby creating a mesh-like network, which appears as threads of warp and weft.

For the first time, the transformed L1 norm is utilized as the regular term of the loss function which is solved by the proximally guided stochastic subgradient in the improved auto-encoder. The trained neural network model can be utilized for pattern recognition of the different multisource partial discharge signals.

Extreme gradient boosting (XGB) models relating PAD to an existing bathymetry/not bathymetry classification were fitted and evaluated for four areas near the Florida Keys. The PAD examined include 'pulse specific' information such as the return intensity and PAD describing flight path consistency. The R-2 values for the XGB models were between 0.34 and 0.74. Global classification accuracies were above 80% although this reflected a sometimes extreme Bathy/NotBathy imbalance that inflated global accuracy. This imbalance was mitigated by employing a probability decision threshold (PDT) that equalizes the true positive (Bathy) and true negative (NotBathy) rates. It was concluded that 1) the strength of the bathymetric signal in the PAD should be sufficient to increase accuracy of density-based lidar point cloud bathymetry extraction methods and 2) ML can successfully model the relationship between the PAD and the Bathy/NotBathy classification.

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Objectives Inflammatory cytokines are key regulators of inflammation, but current measurement approaches require venous blood to quantify low circulating concentrations associated with chronic, low-grade inflammation. This article describes a highly sensitive multiplex immunoassay protocol for the measurement of IL6, IL8, IL10, and TNF alpha in finger stick dried blood spot (DBS) samples. Methods The protocol uses a multiplex electrochemiluminescent immunoassay platform. The following measures of assay performance were evaluated: reliability (inter-assay percent coefficient of variation; %CV), precision (intra-assay %CV), lower limit of detection (LLD), linearity of dilution, and agreement with results from matched plasma samples. Results Analysis of three control samples across the assay range indicated an acceptable level of precision and reliability for each cytokine. Linearity of dilution returned average values that ranged from 104.1 to 127.6% of expected. Lower limits of detection for IL6, IL8, and IL10 were <0.5, and <1.0 pg/ml for TNF alpha. Level of agreement in results between matched DBS and plasma samples was high for all cytokines except for IL8. Conclusions Finger stick DBS sampling provides a viable alternative to venipuncture for the quantification of IL6, IL10, and TNF alpha at low concentrations associated with chronic inflammation. The presence of red blood cells may interfere with the quantification of IL8 in DBS.

Methods Previous study results on social participation in the four areas are reported and each area is substantiated by an exemplar case study. Results Cancer in childhood and adolescence can have a negative impact on participation, for example, if contacts with friends are lost or school attendance is interrupted for a long time. The disease and its therapy can have effects into young adulthood. Social participation is especially restricted in patients with brain and bone tumors.

Patients in the low-risk group had significantly better prognosis than those in the high-risk group. Time-dependent ROC analysis demonstrated that the glycolysis-related gene signature had excellent prognostic accuracy. We further confirmed the expression of the four prognostic genes in breast cancer and paracancerous tissue samples using qRT-PCR analysis. Expression level of PRKACB was higher in paracancerous tissues, while STMN1 and ZNF292 were overexpressed in tumor samples, no significant difference was observed in ALDH2 expression level. Global proteome data of 105 TCGA breast cancer samples obtained from the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) were used to evaluate the prognostic value in protein levels.

However, the falling of roller athletes also happens frequently. Upon the roller athletes' fall, it means that the whole competition is over and even the roller athletes are perhaps injured. In order to stave off the tragedy, the roller track can be analyzed and be notified the roller athlete to terminate the competition. With such consideration, this paper analyzes the roller track by using two advanced technologies, i.e., pattern recognition and neural network, in which each roller athlete is equipped with an automatic movement identifier (AMI). Meanwhile, AMI is connected with the remote video monitor referee via the transmission of 5G network. In terms of AMI, its function is realized by pattern recognition, including data collection module, data processing module, and data storage module. Among them, the data storage module considers the data classification based on roller track. In addition, the neural network is used to train the roller tracks stored at AMI and give the further analysis results for the remote video monitor referee. Based on NS3, the devised AMI is simulated and the experimental results reveal that the prediction accuracy can reach 100% and the analyzed results can be used for the falling prevention timely.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 7007}

This mimics the form of an estuary, a layered site for negotiating nationhood, industrialisation, and placelessness, that, for these authors, flows from the local to the global, but always returns to estuarial flow. For Jewett, famous for her American literary regionalism, I look at the globally/nationally expansive imaginary of her short story, 'River Driftwood', with its local context of river/harbour and historical moment of shifting maritime industry alongside river technology. Next, the modernist poet H.D.'s 'Leda' - with its abstract layering of the same Maine harbours, the industrial Lehigh river, and a palimpsested mythological place - forms an estuary whose resistance of Zeus (the industrial) is rooted in its natural movements. Finally, working from theories of planetarity and hydrology, I suggest that Bogan in her poem 'Night', localises planetary systems within the immediate movement of tidal mixtures. Thus, these literary estuaries emerge as sites of layered movement, rather than singular points of connection or separation; they produce, like river and ocean flowing together, an estuarial imaginary.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 7013}

Our study aims to explore the impact of exosomal miR-451a on the progression of HCC. Expression of miR-451a and a disintegrin and metalloprotease 10 (ADAM10) in HCC tissues and adjacent normal tissues were determined. The exosomes were extracted from hucMSCs and co-cultured with Hep3B and SMMC-7721 cell lines. After the treatment of relative exosomes or exosome inhibitor GW4869 in Hep3B and SMMC-7721 cells, the paclitaxel resistance and malignant phenotypes of HCC cells were measured. Moreover, the effect of hucMSCs-derived exosomes on the expression of miR-451a and ADAM10 in HCC cells was assessed. The targeting relationship between miR-451a and ADAM10 was verified to detect the impact of ADAM10-wild type and ADAM10-mutant type (MUT) on HCC cell processes. Low expression of miR-451a and high expression of ADAM10 indicated a poor prognosis of HCC patients. MiR-451a was up-regulated while ADAM10 was down-regulated in HCC cells after co-culture with HucMSC-derived exosomes. The exosomes elevated miR-451a and inhibited ADAM10 to suppress the paclitaxel resistance, cell cycle transition, proliferation, migration and invasion, and promote apoptosis of HCC cells. ADAM10 was verified to be a target gene of miR-451a. ADAM10-MUT promoted HCC process independent of miR-451a mimic. HucMSC-derived exosomal miR-451a could restrict the epithelial-mesenchymal transition of HCC cells by targeting ADAM10, which might provide new targets for HCC treatment.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 7018}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Aims and Objectives To investigate the factors associated with the exacerbations of COVID-19. Background At present, COVID-19 is prevalent in the world, seriously endangering the property and life safety of people around the world. Currently, there are many reports on the clinical features, complications and risk factors of death of COVID-19, but there are few reports on the factors associated with the exacerbation of COVID-19. Design Case-control Study. Methods Patients with COVID-19 were recruited from four designated hospitals for novel coronavirus pneumonia in Xiangyang City, Hubei Province from January to April 2020. The patients were divided into disease exacerbation group (n = 53) and disease stabilisation group (n = 265) according to the disease progression during hospitalisation. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression were used to identify the factors associated with the exacerbation of COVID-19. The research was reported according to STROBE statement. Results Univariate analysis showed there were significant differences in gender, age, hypertension, heart disease, kidney disease, white blood cell count, percentage of neutrophil, percentage of lymphocyte, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, total protein, albumin, creatinine, calcium ion, rate of erythrocyte sedimentation, cough, expectoration, chest tightness, gastrointestinal discomfort and dyspnoea between the two groups. The variables with p < 0.05 in the aforementioned difference analysis were included in binary logistic regression analysis, which showed that age, hypertension history, chest tightness, percentage of neutrophil, percentage of lymphocyte, lactate dehydrogenase and creatinine were independent factors associated with COVID-19 disease exacerbation. Conclusion Clinicians may warn the exacerbation of COVID-19 facing above risk factors and associated characteristics, and adjust the diagnosis and treatment plan to delay the disease progression, reduce complications and mortality and improve the prognosis of patients. Relevance to Clinical Practice Patients with certain risk factors associated with COVID-19 diseases exacerbation should be observed and targeted by using effective early interventions.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 7022}
{"label": "NEG", "text": "Purpose The purpose of this paper is to determine both analytically and numerically the kink solutions to a new one-dimensional, viscoelastic generalization of Burgers' equation, which includes a non-linear constitutive law, and the number of kinks as functions of the non-linearity and relaxation parameters. Design/methodology/approach An analytical procedure and two explicit finite difference methods based on first-order accurate approximations to the first-order derivatives are used to determine the single- and double-kink solutions. Findings It is shown that only two parameters characterize the solution and that the existence of a shock wave requires that the (semi-positive) relaxation parameter be less than unity and the non-linearity parameter be less than two. It is also shown that negative values of the non-linearity parameter result in kinks with a single inflection point and strain and dissipation rates with a single relative minimum and a single, relative maximum, respectively. For non-linearity parameters between one and two, it is shown that the kink has three inflection points that merge into a single one as this parameter approaches one and that the strain and dissipation rates exhibit relative maxima and minima whose magnitudes decrease and increase as the relaxation and nonlinearity coefficients, respectively, are increased. It is also shown that the viscoelastic generalization of the Burgers equation presented here is related to an phi(8)-scalar field. Originality/value A new, one-dimensional, viscoelastic generalization of Burgers' equation, which includes a non-linear constitutive law and relaxation is proposed, and its kink solutions are determined both analytically and numerically. The equation and its solutions are connected with scalar field theories and may be used to both studies the effects of the non-linearity and relaxation and assess the accuracy of numerical methods for first-order, non-linear partial differential equations.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 7023}

The identification of such variants in genes with only tentative associations to Mendelian diseases can add to the existing evidence when observed in the context of compatible phenotypes. In this study, we report 20 homozygous variants in 18 genes (ADAMTS18, ARNT2, ASTN1, C3, DMBX1, DUT, GABRB3, GM2A, KIF12, LOXL3, NUP160, PTRHD1, RAP1GDS1, RHOBTB2, SIGMAR1, SPAST, TENM3, and WASHC5) that satisfy the ACMG classification for pathogenic/likely pathogenic if the involved genes had confirmed rather than tentative links to diseases.

{"label": "NEG", "text": "A boosted regression tree model was developed to predict pH conditions in three dimensions throughout the glacial aquifer system of the contiguous United States using pH measurements in samples from 18,386 wells and predictor variables that represent aspects of the hydrogeologic setting. Model results indicate that the carbonate content of soils and aquifer materials strongly controls pH and, when coupled with long flowpaths, results in the most alkaline conditions. Conversely, in areas where glacial sediments are thin and carbonate-poor, pH conditions remain acidic. At depths typical of drinking-water supplies, predicted pH >7.5-which is associated with arsenic mobilization-occurs more frequently than predicted pH <6-which is associated with water corrosivity and the mobilization of other trace elements. A novel aspect of this model was the inclusion of numerically based estimates of groundwater flow characteristics (age and flowpath length) as predictor variables. The sensitivity of pH predictions to these variables was consistent with hydrologic understanding of groundwater flow systems and the geochemical evolution of groundwater quality. The model was not developed to provide precise estimates of pH at any given location. Rather, it can be used to more generally identify areas where contaminants may be mobilized into groundwater and where corrosivity issues may be of concern to prioritize areas for future groundwater monitoring.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 7030}

The boundary of voids in the design domain is described by RBF (radial basis function) function controlled by RBF knots in polar coordinate, where the voids are projected onto a fixed grid using Heaviside function. For merging overlapped multiple voids, the p-norm function is introduced to describe composite density field. The differentiability of the projection-based boundary description algorithm allows for the sensitivity analysis via the chain rule, and therefore, it enables an efficient gradient-based optimization method. The goal of this paper is to optimize the initial design to generate buckling-induced mechanism under large deformation, and without loss of generality, the hyperelastic material model is chosen to describe the material behavior. Notably, this method possesses the merit of level set method, where the intermediate density only exists at the boundary of topology shape. At the same time, the proposed method is still in the density-based optimization framework and standard sensitivity analysis of density-based methods can be directly derived based on the chain rule.

{"label": "NEG", "text": "The root system of maize tends to be shallower with plowing tillage than with rotary tilling in upland fields converted from paddy fields. Soil hardness and fertilizer distribution differ between plowing tillage and rotary tilling; thus, we investigated the maize root system at different growth stages with or without fertilizer application in both of these tillage methods. We evaluated the effect of soil hardness on the root system by comparing plowing tillage and rotary tilling in unfertilized plots, and the effect of fertilization by comparing responses to fertilizer application with plowing tillage and rotary tilling since the effects of tillage and fertilization cannot be separated in each tillage method. Root depth index (RDI), which indicates average root depth, was about 20% smaller with plowing tillage than with rotary tilling after the 7th leaf growth stage (V7) in unfertilized plots. Although RDI in fertilized plots was similar or slightly smaller than that in unfertilized plots, the interaction between fertilization and tillage was not significant, except at the tassel formation stage in 2016. Analysis of root distribution indicated that root length density at soil depths of 0-5 cm tended to be higher with plowing tillage than with rotary tilling after V7, but the effect of the interaction between fertilization and tillage was not significant. These results suggest that the root system of maize becomes shallower after V7 with plowing tillage than with rotary tilling mainly due to higher soil penetration resistance in upland fields converted from paddy fields.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 7057}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Background: Alterations of astrocyte function play a crucial role in neuroinflammatory diseases due to either the loss of their neuroprotective role or the gain of their toxic inflammatory properties. Accumulating evidence highlights that cannabinoids and cannabinoid receptor agonists, such as WIN55,212-2 (WIN), reduce inflammation in cellular and animal models. Thus, the endocannabinoid system has become an attractive target to attenuate chronic inflammation in neurodegenerative diseases. However, the mechanism of action of WIN in astrocytes remains poorly understood. Objective: We studied the immunosuppressive property of WIN by examining gene expression patterns that were modulated by WIN in reactive astrocytes. Materials and Methods: Transcriptomic analysis by RNA-seq was carried out using primary human astrocyte cultures stimulated by the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 1 beta (IL1 beta) in the presence or absence of WIN. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis was conducted on selected transcripts to characterize the dose-response effects of WIN, and to test the effect of selective antagonists of cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR). Results: Transcriptomic analysis showed that the IL1 beta-induced inflammatory response is robustly inhibited by WIN pretreatment. WIN treatment alone also induced substantial gene expression changes. Pathway analysis revealed that the anti-inflammatory properties of WIN were linked to the regulation of kinase pathways and gene targets of neuroprotective transcription factors, including PPAR and SMAD (mothers against decapentaplegic homolog). The inhibitory effect of WIN was dose-dependent, but it was not affected by selective antagonists of CB1 or PPAR. Conclusions: This study suggests that targeting the endocannabinoid system may be a promising strategy to disrupt inflammatory pathways in reactive astrocytes. The anti-inflammatory activity of WIN is independent of CB1, suggesting that alternative receptors mediate the effects of WIN. These results provide mechanistic insights into the anti-inflammatory activity of WIN and highlight that astrocytes are a potential therapeutic target to ameliorate neuroinflammation in the brain.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 7069}

Mainly to identify target sequences in order to generate robust vaccines and neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, but also to track viral genetic temporal and geographic evolution and to mine for variants associated with reduced or increased disease severity. Several online tools and bioinformatic phylogenetic analyses have been released, but the main interest lies in the Spike protein, which is the pivotal element of current vaccine design, and in the Receptor Binding Domain, that accounts for most of the neutralizing the antibody activity. Methods Here, we present an open-source bioinformatic protocol, and a web portal focused on SARS-CoV-2 single mutations and minimal consensus sequence building as a companion vaccine design tool.

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Background: Video telehealth is an important tool for health care delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given physical distancing recommendations, access to traditional in-person telehealth training for providers has been limited. Telesimulation is an alternative to in-person telehealth training. Telesimulation training with both remote participants and facilitators using telehealth software has not been described. Objective: We investigated the feasibility of a large group telesimulation provider training of telehealth software for remote team leadership skills with common neonatal cases and procedures. Methods: We conducted a 90-min telesimulation session with a combination of InTouch (TM) provider access software and Zoom (TM) teleconferencing software. Zoom facilitators activated InTouch software and devices and shared their screen with remote participants. Participants rotated through skill stations and case scenarios through Zoom and directed bedside facilitators to perform simulated tasks using the shared screen and audio connection. Participants engaged in a debrief and a pre- and postsurvey assessing participants' comfort and readiness to use telemedicine. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and paired t tests. Results: Twenty (n = 20) participants, five Zoom and eight bedside facilitators participated. Twenty-one (21) pre- and 16 postsurveys were completed. Most participants were attending neonatologists who rarely used telemedicine software. Postsession, participants reported increased comfort with some advanced InTouch features, including taking and sharing pictures with the patient (p < 0.01) and drawing on the shared image (p < 0.05), but less comfort with troubleshooting technical issues, including audio and stethoscope (p < 0.01). Frequently stated concerns were troubleshooting technical issues during a call (75%, n = 16) and personal discomfort with telemedicine applications and technology (56%, n = 16). Conclusion: Large group telesimulation is a feasible way to offer telehealth training for physicians and can increase provider comfort with telehealth software.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 7093}

I beg the limitations here made may be remarked, when I say, that a miracle can never be proved, so as to be the foundation of a system of religion.

Metabolic rejuvenation applied to RBCs before transfusion replenishes energetic sources and reverses most storage-related alterations, but how it impacts RBC circulatory functions has not been fully elucidated. Study Design and Methods Six RBC units stored under blood bank conditions were analyzed weekly for 6 weeks and rejuvenated on Day 42 with an adenine-inosine-rich solution. Impact of storage and rejuvenation on adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, morphology, accumulation of storage-induced microerythrocytes (SMEs), elongation under an osmotic gradient (by LORRCA), hemolysis, and phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure was evaluated. The impact of rejuvenation on filterability and adhesive properties of stored RBCs was also assessed. Results Rejuvenation of RBCs restored intracellular ATP to almost normal levels and decreased the PS exposure from 2.78% to 0.41%. Upon rejuvenation, the proportion of SME dropped from 28.2% to 9.5%, while the proportion of normal-shaped RBCs (discocytes and echinocytes 1) increased from 47.7% to 67.1%. In LORCCA experiments, rejuvenation did not modify the capacity of RBCs to elongate and induced a reduction in cell volume. In functional tests, rejuvenation increased RBC filterability in a biomimetic splenic filter (+16%) and prevented their adhesion to endothelial cells (-87%). Conclusion Rejuvenation reduces the proportion of morphologically altered and adhesive RBCs that accumulate during storage.

In addition, these forces have rarely been studied together thus limiting previous attempts to understand the effect of large-scale climatic gradients on herbivory. Location Europe. Time period 2018-2019. Major taxa studied Quercus robur. Methods We simultaneously tested for latitudinal variation in plant-herbivore-natural enemy interactions. We further investigated the underlying climatic factors associated with variation in herbivory, leaf chemistry and attack rates in Quercus robur across its complete latitudinal range in Europe. We quantified insect leaf damage and the incidence of specialist herbivores as well as leaf chemistry and bird attack rates on dummy caterpillars on 261 oak trees. Results Climatic factors rather than latitude per se were the best predictors of the large-scale (geographical) variation in the incidence of gall-inducers and leaf-miners as well as in leaf nutritional content. However, leaf damage, plant chemical defences (leaf phenolics) and bird attack rates were not influenced by climatic factors or latitude. The incidence of leaf-miners increased with increasing concentrations of hydrolysable tannins, whereas the incidence of gall-inducers increased with increasing leaf soluble sugar concentration and decreased with increasing leaf C : N ratios and lignins. However, leaf traits and bird attack rates did not vary with leaf damage.

The membrane utilizes plasmon resonance on a gold island film embedded in a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) layers, and the shift of the resonant wavelength was used as an indicator of pressure-induced strain of the membrane. The membrane with total thickness of 100 mu m was prepared with spin-coating of PDMS and vacuum evaporation of gold island film with the nominal thickness of 10 nm. Pressure sensitivity of the fabricated membrane was demonstrated from the measurement of absorbance spectra and the maximum sensitivity of 0.35 nm/kPa was achieved by applying pressure up to 35 kPa. Plasmon resonance mode attributing to the pressure sensitivity has been analyzed through comparison between electromagnetic simulation and membrane stretching test. From the stretching test, red shifts of the resonant wavelength were obtained for both parallel and perpendicular polarizations to the tensile direction with the sensitivities of 0.372 and 0.134 nm/%, respectively. From the electromagnetic simulation, these red shifts can be attributed to both gap-mode and deformation-mode resonances of the gold island film.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 7137}

Objective: To assess the genetic polymorphisms of CXCR5 and evaluate their possible contribution to the susceptibility and response to therapy of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Patients and Methods: Fifty DLBCL (not otherwise specified) patients and 50 control subjects were included in this study. CXCR5 genotypes were determined by PCR-RFLP. Results: Our study revealed that the CXCR5 rs148351692 C/G and rs6421571 C/T gene polymorphisms are associated with an increased risk of developing DLBCL (OR 28.57 [95% CI 8.96-96.56] and 3.45 [1.67-11.83] respectively), while CXCR5 rs78440425 G/A showed no association with the risk of lymphoma. Moreover, the double and triple combined gene polymorphisms are associated with an increased risk of developing DLBCL of approximately 120-fold and 105-fold, respectively. CXCR5 gene polymorphisms had no significant impact on disease outcome or response to therapy. Conclusions: CXCR5 gene polymorphisms could be considered a potential risk factor for the development of DLBCL. (c) 2020 S. Karger AG, Basel", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 7141}

We measured five fine root functional traits in 179 randomly selected tree individuals of 100 species and analysed the variation of single traits (using Bayesian phylogenetic multilevel models) and of functional trait diversity with small-scale topography. Fine roots exhibited more conservative traits (thicker diameters, lower specific root length and nitrogen concentration) at upper slope compared with lower slope positions, but the largest proportion of variation (40-80%) was explained by species identity and phylogeny. Fine root functional diversity decreased towards the upper slopes. Our results suggest that local topography and the related soil fertility and moisture gradients cause considerable small-scale variation in fine root traits and functional diversity along tropical mountain slopes, with conservative root traits and greater trait convergence being associated with less favourable soil conditions due to environmental filtering. We provide evidence of a high degree of phylogenetic conservation in fine root traits.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 7148}

Drawing on negativity bias, schema congruity theory, and norm-activation model, we investigate the effects of environmentally framed electronic word-of-mouth messages of different valence, on perceived review usefulness, product attitude and purchase intention in products with low versus high EI. Two factorial experiments (positive vs. negative reviews; low vs. high EI) were conducted respectively with a sample of 321 Italian and 250 French consumers. The findings of the two studies show a partial support of the moderating role of product EI, suggesting that products perceived to have a high impact on the environment strengthen the impact of a positive or a negative review carrying environmental messages. The effect of a positive and a negative review is contingent upon the level of consumers' environmental concern. Negative reviews of high impact products are more impactful in contexts in which environmental concerns are high, while positive reviews are more significant when environmental concerns are low. The perceived usefulness of a negative review about high impact products influences consumers' attitude and purchase intention when moral norms are high.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 7150}

Materials and Methods: An online survey was conducted between December 2019 and April 2020 on behalf of the IPEG Research Committee. All IPEG members were contacted by e-mail and asked to complete an anonymous questionnaire that included 39 items on SIPES. Results: One hundred eighty-four practicing pediatric surgeons completed the questionnaire from a pool of 890 IPEG members. The majority (76%) of respondents performed SIPES for more than 6 years with the following caseload per month: 1 case (31%), 2-5 cases (30%), 6-10 cases (24%), and >10 cases (17%). The four most commonly performed procedures were appendectomy (95%), Meckel diverticulectomy (55%), treatment of ovarian pathologies (43%), and U-stitch gastrostomy (40%). Complex reconstructive SIPES procedures were performed rarely. Most surgeons (95%) stated that better cosmesis is the predominant advantage of SIPES procedures. The majority of respondents (70%) felt that there is no convincing scientific evidence that SIPES offers benefits to multi-port minimally invasive procedures. Conclusion: Twenty years after introduction of SIPES, this technique has found its place in pediatric endoscopic surgery. Eighty percent of participating IPEG members of this survey apply SIPES for cases of lower complexity, such as appendectomy mainly for cosmetic reasons. The fact that 70% of respondents state that the scientific evidence for the benefits of SIPES is not convincing suggests that further studies and discussion on this technique are needed.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 7173}

Study Design Incremental cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analyses were undertaken from the perspective of the Australian healthcare system using an 18-year time horizon. Methods A decision tree was used to model the costs and outcomes associated with exome sequencing and standard care for infants presenting with isolated congenital deafness. Results Exome sequencing resulted in an incremental cost of AU$1,000 per child and an additional 30 diagnoses per 100 children tested. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was AU$3,333 per additional diagnosis. The mean societal willingness to pay for exome sequencing was estimated at AU$4,600 per child tested relative to standard care, resulting in a positive net benefit of AU$3,600. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses confirmed the cost-effectiveness of exome sequencing. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of exome sequencing in congenital hearing loss, through increased diagnostic rate and consequent improved process of care by reducing or ceasing diagnostic investigation or facilitating targeted further investigation.

In this work, 11 new 1,4-bis(5-phenyl-1H-imidazol-4-yl)benzene fluorophores 1-11, which were designed to have substituent electronic variations as well as diversity of pi-conjugation, were synthesized, characterized, and experimentally investigated for their mercury(II) sensing potentials. Attractive sensitivity and selectivity results with more than 99% fluorescent turn-off efficiencies were recorded for ligands 3, 4, 5, 10, and 11 at F/F-o values of 140-fold for 3, 174-fold for 4, 116-fold for 5, >302-fold for 10, and 423-fold for 11. Applicable mercury(II) detection profiles devoid of competitions or interferences were found for ligands 3, 7, and 10. The obtained sigmoidal-shaped Job plots suggest that the sensing mechanism by the fluorophores depends on more than one elementary reaction process, while results from mercury titration as well as X-ray structural data indicate an overall stoichiometry of 1:2 for the ligand to Hg2+ interactions. Structural data analyses also revealed that the mechanism of fluorescence turn-off is traceable to aromatic ring twists along the central imidazole-phenyl-imidazole moieties and the consequent loss of coplanarity, which interrupts the core pi-conjugation of the sensors. This experience shows that broad synthetic derivatization is a recommendable strategy for increasing access to appropriately tuned sensor molecules, which are capable of overcoming the often-encountered interferences.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 7177}

Caries increments, measured as the number of new occlusal cavitated lesions, were not different between the sealed (mean 0.23) and the control primary molars (mean 0.29). A multiple mixed-effects logistic regression showed that male gender, moderate/high caries risk, and a higher oral hygiene index score, had a statistically significant effect resulting in higher caries increments in the primary molars, than did female gender, low caries risk, and lower oral hygiene index scores. Sealing showed no statistically significant influence on the development of new caries lesions. After 2 yr, the percentages of partially or totally lost sealants were 22.7% and 32.0%, respectively. In this sample of children, the caries increment was not significantly different between the sealed and the unsealed molars.

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Purpose This study aims to assess the quality of care among adult oncology patients in tertiary care hospitals in Karachi by using an international standard of quality of care and to identify domains where improvement is needed. Design/methodology/approach This is a cross-sectional study carried out at two tertiary care hospitals of Karachi, Pakistan, belonging to private and public sector, respectively, between February and April 2018. Face-to-face interviews were conducted using a modified questionnaire having five-point Likert scale questions regarding satisfaction of patients with doctors, nursing staff, information provided and the hospital standards. SPSS 20 was used for statistical analysis, and the results were expressed using mean, frequencies, percentages and p-values. Findings The authors approached 415 patients, out of which 389 patients agreed to participate in the study. For both hospitals, the lowest mean scores were for sections pertaining to satisfaction with psychosocial support and information provided. The mean satisfaction score of patients from the private hospital were found to be significantly higher as compared to patients from the public hospital for all domains of patient care (p-value t-test for two independent samples). The data showed an increasing trend of \"satisfied\" responses as the household income increased. Research limitations/implications A comparative study should be conducted with the aim of pinpointing the differences in areas in which there is a significant difference in positive satisfaction levels between private and public sectors. Similar research could also be expanded adding other variables that affect quality of care such as doctor's approach to their patients, time given during each consultation and patient's understanding of doctor's knowledge. Further studies can be done to bridge the gaps between what a doctor views as standard care and what the patient knows will help them receive a more holistic approach to care. Practical implications Assessing the quality of care helps determine gaps in care and allocating health resources accordingly. In clinical practice, emphasis needs to be given on increased duration and improved quality of patient counselling to improve the low satisfaction levels of patients regarding the psychosocial support. Addressing patients' concerns should be made part of clinical teaching from an undergraduate level. As far as patient access to doctors of the specific speciality is concerned, hospital managements should adopt systems to ensure continuum of care and come up with mechanisms to bridge the discrepancy between a patient's needs and doctor availability. Social implications After being identified as a major deficiency, training doctors in the sensitivities of the population and demographics, especially with respect to socio-economic statuses, can aid in enhancing patient satisfaction to the treatment. Implementation of patient-centred care leads to greater satisfaction with care, which, in turn, increases a patient's self efficacy in managing important aspects of their care and improves health care-related quality of life. Originality/value Cancer patients have long-term exposure to the hospital environment. A patient's satisfaction with the quality of care is an important determinant in patient compliance to the treatment protocol and required hospital visits. There is a dearth of research on the outpatient quality of care in the oncology departments in Karachi. This study provides an overview of the quality of care available to cancer patients in Karachi both in public and private sectors. The results of our study identify the gaps in the quality of care being provided to the patients in a developing country like Pakistan, which can be used to improve the quality of care, leading to better patient outcomes.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 7181}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Objective Echocardiographic studies have reported that fetuses with low birth weight, compared to those with normal birth weight, have globular hearts and reduced cardiac function. Dichotomizing continuous variables, such as birth weight, may be helpful in describing pathology in small studies but can prevent us from identifying physiological responses in relation to change in size. The aim of this study was to explore associations between fetal cardiac morphology and function and birth weight, as a continuous variable, as well as uterine artery (UtA) pulsatility index (PI), as an indirect measure of placental perfusion, and the cerebroplacental ratio (CPR), as an indirect measure of fetal oxygenation. Methods This was a prospective study of 1498 women with singleton pregnancy undergoing routine ultrasound examination at 35 + 0 to 36 + 6 weeks' gestation. Pregnancies complicated by pregestational or gestational diabetes mellitus, chronic hypertension, pregnancy-induced hypertension or pre-eclampsia were excluded from the analysis. Conventional and more advanced echocardiographic modalities, such as speckle tracking, were used to assess fetal cardiac function in the right and left ventricles. The morphology of the fetal heart was assessed by calculating the right and left sphericity indices. In addition, the PI of the UtA, umbilical artery (UA) and fetal middle cerebral artery (MCA) was determined and the CPR was calculated by dividing MCA-PI by UA-PI. Multiple linear regression models were used to assess determinants o f fetal echocardiographic parameters. Results The study population included 146 (9.7%) small-for-gestational-age (SGA) fetuses with birth weight < 10th percentile and 68 (4.5%) with fetal growth restriction (FGR). In the SGA and FGR groups, compared to the non-SGA and non-FGR fetuses, respectively, there was a more globular right ventricle and reduced left and right ventricular systolic function, and, from the left ventricular diastolic functional indices, the E/A ratio was increased. There was a linear association of right ventricular sphericity index, indices of left and right ventricular systolic function and E/A ratio with birth-weight Z-score. There were no significant associations between cardiac morphological and functional indices and UtA-PI Z-score or CPR Z-score. Conclusions This screening study at 35-37 weeks' gestation has demonstrated that birth weight is a determinant of fetal cardiac morphology and function but UtA-PI and CPR, as indirect measures of placental perfusion and fetal oxygenation, are not. This suggests that the differences in fetal cardiac indices between small and appropriately grown fetuses may be part of a normal physiological response to change in fetal size rather than part of a pathological adaptation to abnormal placental perfusion and fetal oxygenation.

Because this approach is based on equality between all those involved, it results in relationships uncommon in nonparticipatory research. Therefore, ethical questions are raised in a different way.

The case study shows this from the perspective of both the researchers and the peer-researchers. From the peer-researchers' perspective, there are different challenges in participatory teamwork, which can bring impairments and consequently result in a risk of harm. This can lead to disappointments, for example, when from the peer-researchers' perspective individual support during a research process is insufficient. Conclusions for dealing with ethical aspects in participatory research projects will be derived from the gathered experiences.

Methods Patients were randomized to receive either 100 x 10(6) (low dose, n = 27) or 150 x 10(6) (high dose, n = 32) CAR+ T-cells as a single infusion following lymphodepleting chemotherapy (fludarabine 25 mg/m(2) and cyclophosphamide 250 mg/m(2) daily x 3), and then, monitored for efficacy and safety outcomes and pharmacokinetics.

Finally, the transformation uncertainties are quantified via the standard deviation of errors and the coefficient of variation.

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Aberrant expression and phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) contribute to brain insulin resistance. However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. The insulin signaling and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling are two critical pathways for normal cellular function, which interact in both peripheral tissues and the brain and may contribute to insulin resistance. In this study, we aimed to investigate the regulation of IRS-1 and its downstream insulin signaling by Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in primary neurons. We found that the Wnt agonist Wnt3a enhances the insulin signaling in neurons at the basal state via up-regulation of IRS-1. Moreover, Wnt3a up-regulates IRS-1 expression and effectively ameliorates insulin resistance in rat primary neurons induced by chronic high insulin exposure. The insulin-mediated glucose uptake is also stimulated by Wnt3a at both basal and insulin resistant states. We observed that Wnt activation up-regulates IRS-1 gene transcription and the subsequent protein expression in SH-SY5Y cells and rat primary neurons via different means of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling activation, including S33Y beta-catenin over-expression, CHIR99021 and Wnt3a treatment. We further clarified the molecular mechanism of IRS-1 transcriptional activation by Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. The Wnt transcription factor TCF4 binds to the -529 bp to -516 bp of the human IRS-1 promoter fragment and activates IRS-1 transcription. Overall, these data suggested that Wnt/beta-catenin signaling positively regulates IRS-1 and insulin signaling and protects against insulin resistance in neurons.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 7230}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "The role of dietary calcium in cardiovascular disease prevention is unclear. We aimed to determine the association between calcium intake and incident cardiovascular disease and mortality. Data were extracted from the European Prospective Investigation of Cancer, Norfolk (EPIC-Norfolk). Multivariable Cox regressions analysed associations between calcium intake (dietary and supplemental) and cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, aortic stenosis, peripheral vascular disease) and mortality (cardiovascular and all-cause). The results of this study were pooled with those from published prospective cohort studies in a meta-analsyis, stratifying by average calcium intake using a 700 mg/day threshold. A total of 17,968 participants aged 40-79 years were followed up for a median of 20.36 years (20.32-20.38). Compared to the first quintile of calcium intake (< 770 mg/day), intakes between 771 and 926 mg/day (second quintile) and 1074-1254 mg/day (fourth quintile) were associated with reduced all-cause mortality (HR 0.91 (0.83-0.99) and 0.85 (0.77-0.93), respectively) and cardiovascular mortality [HR 0.95 (0.87-1.04) and 0.93 (0.83-1.04)]. Compared to the first quintile of calcium intake, second, third, fourth, but not fifth quintiles were associated with fewer incident strokes: respective HR 0.84 (0.72-0.97), 0.83 (0.71-0.97), 0.78 (0.66-0.92) and 0.95 (0.78-1.15). The meta-analysis results suggest that high levels of calcium intake were associated with decreased all-cause mortality, but not cardiovascular mortality, regardless of average calcium intake. Calcium supplementation was associated with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality amongst women, but not men. Moderate dietary calcium intake may protect against cardiovascular and all-cause mortality and incident stroke. Calcium supplementation may reduce mortality in women.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 7237}

The aim of this study was to assess whether variation in one SCR feature predicts changes in other features. Methods Skin conductance (SC) was measured during relaxation and mental stress in 40 subjects. SCRs were induced by three external stimuli, which were deep breath, a mental arithmetic, task and a visual task. Results The findings of this study showed that about 55% (R-2 = 0.55) of the variation in the half recovery time (SCRs_rec 50%) can be explained by the rise time (SCRs_ris), whereas variation in amplitude of the skin conductance responses (SCRs_amp) and the skin conductance level (SCL) is independent and cannot be explained by the other features, as R-2 values obtained from all analyses among these SCR features in average were lower 0.19. Conclusions The study results suggest that the two timing phases (SCRs_rec and SCRs_ris) are not completely independent from each other, although they might be governed by different sweating mechanisms (secretion and reabsorption). However, SCRs_amp and SCL were independent. These findings can help in choosing the optimal set of features of an automated system for processing EDA, which reflect the alterations in the activation level generated during an emotional episode.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 7271}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Background: Summary measures of population health are increasingly used in different public health reporting systems for setting priorities for health care and social service delivery and planning. Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) are one of the most commonly used health gap summary measures in the field of public health and have become the key metric for quantifying burden of disease (BoD). BoD methodology is, however, complex and highly data demanding, requiring a substantial capacity to apply, which has led to major disparities across researchers and nations in their resources to perform themselves BoD studies and interpret the soundness of available estimates produced by the Global Burden of Disease Study. Methods: BoD researchers from the COST Action European Burden of Disease network reflect on the most important methodological choices to be made when estimating DALYs. The paper provides an overview of eleven methodological decisions and challenges drawing on the experiences of countries working with BoD methodology in their own national studies. Each of these steps are briefly described and, where appropriate, some examples are provided from different BoD studies across the world. Results: In this review article we have identified some of the key methodological choices and challenges that are important to understand when calculating BoD metrics. We have provided examples from different BoD studies that have developed their own strategies in data usage and implementation of statistical methods in the production of BoD estimates. Conclusions: With the increase in national BoD studies developing their own strategies in data usage and implementation of statistical methods in the production of BoD estimates, there is a pressing need for equitable capacity building on the one hand, and harmonization of methods on the other hand. In response to these issues, several BoD networks have emerged in the European region that bring together expertise across different domains and professional backgrounds. An intensive exchange in the experience of the researchers in the different countries will enable the understanding of the methods and the interpretation of the results from the local authorities who can effectively integrate the BoD estimates in public health policies, intervention and prevention programs.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 7300}

Safe and effective vaccines are needed urgently. METHODS In an ongoing multinational, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, pivotal efficacy trial, we randomly assigned persons 16 years of age or older in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses, 21 days apart, of either placebo or the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate (30 mu g per dose). BNT162b2 is a lipid nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine that encodes a prefusion stabilized, membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike protein. The primary end points were efficacy of the vaccine against laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 and safety. RESULTS A total of 43,548 participants underwent randomization, of whom 43,448 received injections: 21,720 with BNT162b2 and 21,728 with placebo. There were 8 cases of Covid-19 with onset at least 7 days after the second dose among participants assigned to receive BNT162b2 and 162 cases among those assigned to placebo; BNT162b2 was 95% effective in preventing Covid-19 (95% credible interval, 90.3 to 97.6). Similar vaccine efficacy (generally 90 to 100%) was observed across subgroups defined by age, sex, race, ethnicity, baseline body-mass index, and the presence of coexisting conditions. Among 10 cases of severe Covid-19 with onset after the first dose, 9 occurred in placebo recipients and 1 in a BNT162b2 recipient. The safety profile of BNT162b2 was characterized by short-term, mild-to-moderate pain at the injection site, fatigue, and headache. The incidence of serious adverse events was low and was similar in the vaccine and placebo groups. CONCLUSIONS A two-dose regimen of BNT162b2 conferred 95% protection against Covid-19 in persons 16 years of age or older. Safety over a median of 2 months was similar to that of other viral vaccines.

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Purpose The purpose of this paper is to analyze the reception and impact of Jurgen Habermas's global academic best seller in the USA between 1974 and 2018. It specifically addresses the consequences of the long delay in the publication of the English translation of Habermas's 1962 public sphere concept until 1989 in the context of Habermas's paradigm shift from the Kantian ideal of a participatory democracy to a systems-theoretical interpretation of deliberative democracy, which informs Between Facts and Norms (1992/1996). Design/methodology/approach This paper can be classified as a \"conceptual paper\" that draws on empirical research, namely, Adrian Rauchfleisch's (2017) bibliometric co-citation analysis of two decades of public sphere research, which features a multi-dimensional scaling of these research communities based on the distance matrix of the co-citation network. Findings As the 22,000 scholarly citations for structural transformation as of April 2018 already indicate, this paper confirms in detail that Habermas's original public sphere concept attracts significantly more academic interest on an interdisciplinary basis than Between Facts and Norms, which no longer pursues a critical theory of contemporary democracy. Instead, this shift toward a uniquely sophisticated theory construction in the realm of normativity produces a work in Rechtstheorie (Thomas McCarthy) that is by definition removed from political practice. The paper demonstrates that only the criteria developed in structural transformation can be applied to the analysis of constitutional crises in the USA.

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Question What factors cause variation in the diagnostic workup and management of pediatric sensorineural hearing loss? Findings In this cross-sectional study of 53 711 pediatric patients, the diagnostic workup and management of pediatric sensorineural hearing loss was not only associated with patient demographic characteristics and clinical factors, but also socioeconomic and clinician factors, such as subspecialties within otolaryngology. Meaning Enhanced standardization and decrease disparity of diagnostic workup and management of pediatric sensorineural hearing loss are needed. This cross-sectional study identifies factors that are associated with disparities in diagnostic workup and intervention of pediatric sensorineural hearing loss. Importance Early detection and intervention of pediatric hearing loss is critical for language development and academic achievement. However, variations in the diagnostic workup and management of pediatric sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) exist. Objective To identify patient and clinician factors that are associated with variation in practice on a national level. Design, Setting, and Participants This cross-sectional study used the Optum claims database to identify 53 711 unique children with SNHL between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures National use rates and mean costs for diagnostic modalities (electrocardiogram, cytomegalovirus testing, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and genetic testing) and interventions (speech-language pathology, billed hearing aid services, and cochlear implant surgery) were reported. The associations of age, sex, SNHL laterality, clinician type, race/ethnicity, and household income with diagnostic workup and intervention use were measured in multivariable analyses. Results Of 53 711 patients, 23 735 (44.2%) were girls, 2934 (5.5%) were Asian, 3797 (7.1%) were Black, 5626 (10.5%) were Hispanic, 33 441 (62.3%) were White, and the mean (SD) age was 7.3 (5.3) years. Of all patients, 32 200 (60.0%) were seen by general otolaryngologists, while 7573 (14.10%) were seen by pediatric otolaryngologists. Diagnostic workup was received by 14 647 patients (27.3%), while 13 482 (25.1%) received intervention. Use of genetic testing increased (odds ratio, 1.22 per year; 95% CI, 1.20-1.24), whereas use of computed tomography decreased (odds ratio, 0.93 per year; 95% CI, 0.92-0.94) during the study period. After adjusting for relevant covariables, children who were seen by pediatric otolaryngologists and geneticists had the highest odds of receiving workup and intervention. Additionally, racial/ethnic and economic disparities were observed in the use of most modalities of diagnostic workup and intervention for pediatric SNHL. Conclusions and Relevance This cross-sectional study identified factors associated with disparities in the diagnostic workup and intervention of pediatric SNHL, thus highlighting the need for increased education and standardization in the management of this common sensory disorder.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 7310}

It agrees that Enlightenment freedom and independence individualism have no place in feminism. Contrary to Khader, however, it maintains that personhood individualism is necessarily a feminist value.

Nor is geometry, when taken into the assistance of natural philosophy, ever able to remedy this defect, or lead us into the knowledge of ultimate causes, by all that accuracy of reasoning for which it is so justly celebrated. Every part of mixed mathematics proceeds upon the supposition that certain laws are established by nature in her operations; and abstract reasonings are employed, either to assist experience in the discovery of these laws, or to determine their influence in particular instances, where it depends upon any precise degree of distance and quantity. Thus, it is a law of motion, discovered by experience, that the moment or force of any body in motion is in the compound ratio or proportion of its solid contents and its velocity; and consequently, that a small force may remove the greatest obstacle or raise the greatest weight, if, by any contrivance or machinery, we can increase the velocity of that force, so as to make it an overmatch for its antagonist. Geometry assists us in the application of this law, by giving us the just dimensions of all the parts and figures which can enter into any species of machine; but still the discovery of the law itself is owing merely to experience, and all the abstract reasonings in the world could never lead us one step towards the knowledge of it.", "group": "PHIL", "id": 7325}

Merging data from the screener and 2-1-1, we found that the screener identified all of the social needs expressed to 2-1-1 for about half the participants, and on average identified at least one social need not expressed to 2-1-1 (i.e., unexpressed needs). Certain social needs (utility payment assistance, housing) were much more likely to be expressed than unexpressed, while others (childcare, employment, personal safety) were almost universally unexpressed. In regression analyses, having certain expressed needs significantly increased the odds of having certain unexpressed needs.

Pilot studies assessing FDA-approved diabetes drugs in subjects with early-stage disease have found cognitive benefit in subjects comorbid for insulin resistance. In AD mouse models with concomitant insulin resistance, we have shown that 4 weeks of RSG can reverse peripheral and central insulin resistance concomitant with rescue of hippocampus-dependent fear learning and memory and hippocampal circuitry deficits in 9-month-old (9MO) Tg2576 mice with no effect in wild-type (WT) mice. Bioinformatics analysis of genomic and proteomic data reveals an intimate link between PPAR gamma and MAPK/ERK signaling in the hippocampus. We then demonstrated a direct interaction between PPAR gamma and phospho-ERK in vitro and in vivo during memory consolidation. The translational value of this discovery is evidenced by the positive correlational relationship between human AD postmortem brain levels of pERK-PPAR gamma nuclear complexes with cognitive reserve. Methods We tested whether insulin sensitizer therapy could rescue spatial navigation, context discrimination, and object recognition learning and memory in aged wild-type and Tg2576 mice in addition to hippocampus-dependent contextual fear learning and memory, as we have previously reported. Results We found that rosiglitazone treatment improved cognitive domains that predominantly rely upon the dorsal hippocampus rather than those that additionally engage the ventral hippocampus.

Methods Kaizen methodology was followed to identify problem areas in the consenting process. Additionally, stakeholders were invited to participate in focus groups and fill out surveys to identify issues preventing participation in the Seal Indiana program (N = 48) and later to evaluate the changes made (N = 48). The redesigned form and process were then used in a pilot study at 14 sites to determine the impact that changes had on levels of participation as measured by the number of consent forms completed and returned. Results There was a statistically significant increase in the number of consent forms returned. The measured change represented a 32 percent increase in program participation (P value = 0.035). A statistically significant increase was observed in how participants viewed the attractiveness of the form and how easy it was to read and comprehend.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and influential factors of hypertension in the adult population of the Marmara region, Turkey. Methods. The study was conducted in 10 provinces in the Marmara region between June 01, 2018, and November 30, 2018. Participants included 2353 patients over 18 years of age diagnosed with hypertension by any of the 30 family physicians working in the Family Health Centers in these provinces. After the participants provided written consent, a survey consisting of 25 questions was administered by their family physicians. SPSS 25.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, New York, United States) was used for all statistical analysis calculations. Results. The patients included 1449 females (61.6%) and 904 males (38.4%). Among the respondents, 1555 (73.1%) had primary hypertension etiology and 572 (26.9%) had secondary etiology. While 1614 patients (68.6%) did not exercise at all, 739 patients (31.4%) reported exercising; 1026 patients (43.9%) did not restrict salt in their diet; and 1134 patients (48.2%) had a family history of hypertension.

In total, 24 female workers across various organizations in Jordan participated in this study. Findings The results show how prejudice against female workers can affect the six dimensions of their eudaimonic psychological well-being (Ryff, 1989). Specifically, the results show that prejudice may push women to work harder to prove they are capable of achieving their goals and, as a result, it may positively enhance their self-acceptance, sense of growth, purpose in life and autonomy. However, the study also shows that prejudice against women negatively affects their environmental mastery and relationships with others. Practical implications This study may help create greater sensitivity and awareness about gender prejudice and its effects on female workers' psychological well-being.

Yet the usage of persons capable of so gross a misapprehension, determines the meaning of language; and the words they thus misuse grow in generality, until the instructed are obliged to acquiesce; and to employ those words (first freeing them from vagueness by giving them a definite connotation) as generic terms, subdividing the genera into species.

This study aimed to investigate the psychometric properties of the Persian version of the self-report API in adolescents. In this descriptive study, A total of 162 Iranian adolescents in the age range of 12 to 18 years were considered as the sample group, which included two groups of school students (n = 125) and adolescent patients with abdominal pain (n = 37). Clinical sample was selected by the available sampling method, and nonclinical sample was selected by the cluster sampling method. Adolescents in the sample group were selected from both clinical and nonclinical groups in order to evaluate differential validity. Instruments, including API, somatic symptoms subscale of the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), and McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ), were also completed for the participants. Also, to evaluate the construct validity of API, exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis methods were applied. The exploratory factor analysis identified one general factor, and the confirmatory factor analysis results show the model's satisfactory fitting. Also, the researchers' hypothesis, i.e., API is a single-factor model (with five items), was approved. The reliability coefficient of the questionnaire was satisfactory for the total scale (alpha < 0.7).

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are expected to find extensive applicability and accelerating deployment in the future. However, the main challenge faced in WSN is its perishing lifetime. The process of clustering a network is a popular mechanism employed for the purpose of extending the lifespan of WSNs and thereby making efficient data transmission. The main aim of a clustering algorithm is to elect an optimal cluster head (CH). The recent research trend suggests meta-heuristic algorithms for the selection of optimal CHs. Meta-heuristic algorithms possess the advantages of being simple, flexible, derivation-free, and avoids local optima. This research proposes a novel hybrid grey wolf optimiser-based sunflower optimisation (HGWSFO) algorithm for optimal CH selection (CHS) under certain factor constraints such as energy spent and separation distance, such that the network lifetime is enhanced. Sunflower optimisation (SFO) is employed for a broader search (exploration) where the variation of the step-size parameter brings the plant closer to the sun in search of global refinement, thus increasing the exploration efficiency. Grey wolf optimisation (GWO) is employed for a narrow search (exploitation), where the parameter coefficient vectors are deliberately required to emphasise exploitation. This balances the exploration-exploitation trade-off, prolongs the network lifetime, increases the energy efficiency, and enhances the performance of the network with respect to overall throughput, residual energy of nodes, dead nodes, alive nodes, network survivability index, and convergence rate. The superior characteristic of the suggested HGWSFO is validated by comparing its performance with various other existing CHS algorithms. The overall performance of the proposed HGWSFO is 28.58%, 31.53%, 48.8%, 49.67%, 54.95%, 70.76%, and 87.10%, better than that of GWO, SFO, particle swarm optimisation (PSO), improved PSO, low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH), LEACH-centralised, and direct transmission, respectively.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 7388}

Despite the high prevalence of stroke in Ethiopia, there is a paucity of data with regard to drug treatment, treatment outcome, and risk factors of poor treatment outcome of stroke. Hence, this study is aimed at assessing treatment outcome and its determinants among patients admitted to stroke unit of Jimma University Medical Center (JUMC). Methods. A two-year hospital-based retrospective cross-sectional study was employed to analyze the medical records of patients admitted with stroke to stroke unit of Jimma University Medical Centre from February 1(st), 2016 to March 30(th), 2018. Data was entered by Epidata manager version 4.0.2 and analyzed by SPSS version 24. Multivariable logistic regression analysis with the backward stepwise approach was done to identify independent predictors of poor treatment outcome of stroke. Variables with P value less than 0.05 were considered as statically significant determinants of poor treatment outcome. Results. Of 220 patients with stroke admitted to the Jimma University, 67.30% were male. Nearly two thirds (63.18%) of them had poor treatment outcomes. Dyslipidimics were administered to 60% of the patients, and the most popular antiplatelet used was aspirin, which was prescribed to 67.3% the patients. Age >= 65 adjusted odd ratio ((AOR): 2.56; 95% CI: 1.95-9.86, P=0.001), presence of comorbidity (AOR: 5.25; 95% CI: 1.08-17.69, P<0.001), admission with hemorrhagic stroke (AOR: 18.99; 95% CI: 7.05-42.07, P<0.001), and admission to the hospital after 24 hour of stroke onset (AOR: 4.98; 95% CI: 1.09-21.91, P=0.03) were independent predictors of poor treatment outcomes. Conclusion. Substantial numbers of stroke patients had poor treatment outcomes. Elderly patients, patients diagnosed with hemorrhagic stroke, patients with comorbidity, and those with delayed hospital admission were more likely to have poor treatment outcome. Hence, frequent monitoring and care should be given for the aforementioned patients. Awareness creation on the importance of early admission should be delivered particularly for patients who have risk factors of stroke (cardiovascular diseases).", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 7392}

Design/methodology/approach - Big data analysis is conducted using Airbnb users' online reviews of 16 US cities; correlation is run on review scores. Findings - The key themes of Airbnb users' online reviews are \"clean,\" \"location,\" \"stay,\" \"home,\" \"place,\" \"host,\" \"neighborhood\" and \"recommend\" and users have positive Airbnb experiences in general. The score of \"cleanliness\" significantly affects the \"overall review\" score. Research limitations/implications - This study is exploratory in nature; mixed methods should be used in the future to measure the relationship between user experience and extracted themes. As the context is in the USA in the current study, comparisons of review patterns across different countries and regions are necessary for later studies. Furthermore, future studies should consider Airbnb users' demographics, personality and lodging preferences. Practical implications - It is important for Airbnb hosts to maintain a clean and accessible property.

A major challenge for improving conservation actions is to know the plant richness, protected by these areas. Online databases offer an accessible way to build plant species lists and to provide relevant information about biodiversity. A list of land plants of \"Parque Nacional do Caparao\" (PNC) was previously built using online databases and published on the website \"Catalogo de Plantas das Unidades de Conservacao do Brasil.\" Here, we provide and discuss additional information about plant species richness, endemism and conservation in the PNC that could not be included in the List. We documented 1,791 species of land plants as occurring in PNC, of which 63 are cited as threatened (CR, EN or VU) by the Brazilian National Red List, seven as data deficient (DD) and five as priorities for conservation. Fifity-one species were possible new ocurrences for ES and MG states. New information \"Parque Nacional do Caparao\" houses 8% of the land plant species endemic to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, including 6% of its angiosperms, 31% of its lycophytes and ferns and 14% of its avascular plants.

However, it remains unclear how genetic variation of ex situ plant collections reflects diversity of wild source populations. We conducted a global meta-analysis of the genetic representativeness of ex situ populations by comparing genetic diversity (i.e., AR, allelic richness; H-e, expected heterozygosity; PPB, percent polymorphic bands; and SWI, Shannon-Winner index), inbreeding coefficient (F-IS), and genetic differentiation between ex situ plant collections and their wild source populations. Genetic diversity (i.e., H-e, PPB, and SWI) was significantly lower in ex situ populations than their wild source populations, whereas genetic differentiation between ex situ and wild populations (ex-situ-wild F-ST), but not that among ex situ populations, was significantly higher than among wild populations. Outcrossing species, but not those with mixed mating system, had significantly lower genetic diversity in ex situ populations and significantly higher ex-situ-wild F-ST. When the collection size for ex situ conservation was >= 30 or 50, PPB, H-e, and ex-situ-wild F-ST were not significantly different between ex situ and wild populations, indicating a relatively high genetic representativeness. Collecting from the entire natural distribution range and mixing collections from different sources could significantly increase the genetic representativeness of ex situ populations. Type of ex situ conservation (i.e., planting or seed bank) had no effect on genetic representativeness. The effect size of H-e decreased and the effect size of ex-situ-wild F-ST increased as the duration of ex situ conservation increased. Our results suggest that current ex situ plant collections do not effectively capture the genetic variation of wild populations. Low genetic representativeness of ex situ populations was caused by both initial incomplete sampling from wild populations and genetic erosion during ex situ conservation.

We performed a retrospective analysis in a cohort of virologically suppressed HIV+ pts switching to DT or BIC in our center. Primary endpoint was to evaluate time to treatment discontinuation (TD) for any cause. Survival analysis was employed to determine time to TD and its predictors were analyzed by Cox regression. Moreover, we collected viro-immunological parameters as well as markers of renal function and lipid profile at baseline and after 24 weeks and assessed changes through nonparametric tests. We analyzed 476 patients: 350 starting a DT and 126 starting BIC. Overall, we registered 21 TD: 15 in the DT group during 170 patient-years of follow-up (PYFU) (a rate of 8.8 per 100 PYFU) and 6 in the BIC one during 48 PYFU (12.5 per 100 PYFU). Estimated probabilities of maintaining study regimen after 24 weeks were 95.5% [standard deviation (SD) +/- 1.1] in the DT group and 94.9% (SD +/- 2.0) in the BIC group, with no significant differences between them (log-rank p = .639). Concerning metabolic profile, in the DT group, after 24 weeks, triglycerides decreased significantly (median change -14 mg/dL, p < .001), whereas high-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased (+3 mg/dL, p = .031). In the BIC group, meanwhile, we observed a significant decrease in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol after 24 weeks (-13 mg/dL, p = .026). Both optimization strategies showed high tolerability in the short term in experienced pts, with few differences between them.

Secondly, we address partial success, that is, the notion that actors concede on some points, but in return succeed in others. We investigate these two characteristics in the 2014 reform of Swiss agricultural policy. Based on cluster and social network analysis, we exemplify how negotiated agreements embedded in a participatory policy process lead to a surprising level of policy change by promoting agricultural production practices with an intended positive effect on the environment. We show that rather than coalitions based on policy core beliefs, the formation of groups of actors based on secondary beliefs who span across the coalitions formed the basis for a negotiated agreement. Green and conservative groups were both able to achieve partial success.

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Introduction: The role of host immune responses in the pathogenesis of borrelial dissemination in early Lyme borreliosis (LB) in the form of multiple erythema migrans (MEM) or LB-associated symptoms is incompletely understood. Methods: In this study, fifteen cytokine or chemokine levels, representative of innate, Th1, and Th17 immune responses, were assessed using a bead-based Luminex multiplex assay in acute sera from 76 adult patients with skin culture-positive Borrelia afzelii solitary erythema migrans (SEM) and 58 patients with MEM at a single-center university hospital. Differences between the groups were tested by modeling each cytokine or chemokine concentration by means of left-censored regression using the classic Tobit model. Results: Mean serum cytokine or chemokine levels were low. When taking into account the proportion of patients with cytokine or chemokine concentrations below the lowest detectable limit, only levels of CXCL10 (p = .03) and CCL19 (p = .02), representatives of the Th1 immune response, differed between patients with SEM and those with MEM; however, the differences did not reach statistical significance when adjusted for multiple comparisons. In addition, we did not find differences in systemic inflammatory responses when comparing patients with and those without LB-associated constitutional symptoms. Conclusion: No significant differences in systemic immune responses represented by selected cytokines or chemokines in serum samples of patients with EM infected with B. afzelii suggest that systemic mediators are not pivotal in the pathogenesis of dissemination of early infection in the form of MEM or LB-associated symptoms. Localized immune responses in the skin or other pathogenetic mechanisms may be more important in this regard.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 7440}

The vast diversity in potential target regions, appearance and multifarious intensity threshold levels of various tumor types are few of the major factors that affect segmentation results.

Herein, we focus on a smart, automated, and robust segmentation approach for brain tumor using a modified 3D U-Net architecture. The pre-operative multimodal 3D-MRI scans of High-Grade Glioma (HGG) and Low-Grade Glioma (LGG) are used as data. Our proposed approach solves the problem of memory and system resource constraints by robustly applying dense network training on image patches of 3D volumes. It improves the border region artifact detection by applying convolutions at an appropriate phase in the proposed neural network. Multi-class imbalance data are handled by using Categorical Cross Entropy (CCE) loss developed by combining the Weighted Cross Entropy (WCE) with Weighted Multi-class Dice Loss (WMDL) functions, which enables the network to perform smart segmentation of the smaller tumorous regions. The proposed approach is tested and evaluated for the challenge datasets of multimodal MRI volumes of tumor patients.

Methods Adult survivors of childhood cancer (n = 2,859, >= 10 years from diagnosis, >= 18 years old) completed a comprehensive neurocognitive battery and clinical examination. Neurocognitive impairment was defined as age-adjusted z score < 10th percentile. Participants impaired on >= 3 tests had global impairment. CHCs were graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.3 (grade 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe/disabling; 4, life-threatening) and were combined into a severity/burden score by frequency and grade (none/low, medium, high, and very high). A total of 1,598 survivors received CNS-directed therapy including cranial radiation, intrathecal methotrexate, or neurosurgery. Logistic regression estimated the odds of neurocognitive impairment associated with severity/burden score and grade 2 to 4 conditions, stratified by CNS treatment. Results CNS-treated survivors performed worse than non-CNS-treated survivors on all neurocognitive tests and were more likely to have global neurocognitive impairment (46.9% vs 35.3%, p < 0.001). After adjusting for demographic and treatment factors, there was a dose-response association between severity/burden score and global neurocognitive impairment, but only among CNS-treated survivors (high odds ratio [OR] = 2.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.42-3.53; very high OR = 4.07, 95% CI = 2.30-7.17). Cardiovascular and pulmonary conditions were associated with processing speed, executive function, and memory impairments in CNS-treated but not non-CNS-treated survivors who were impacted by neurologic conditions.

Here, a new method is proposed to massively increase the electrochemical capacity of aqueous Zn/V5O12 center dot 6H(2)O batteries. By adding a small amount of platinum (Pt, 1.5 wt.%) and keeping other factors constant, the V5O12 center dot 6H(2)O-Pt electrodes deliver a much higher specific capacity (440 mAh g(-1) at 500 mA g(-1)) than do V5O12 center dot 6H(2)O electrodes (270 mAh g(-1) at 500 mA g(-1)). The structural and morphological evolution of V5O12 center dot 6H(2)O during cycling results in Zn2+ ion insertion/extraction and the formation/disappearance of the zinc hydroxyl complex (Zn4SO4(OH)(6)center dot 5H(2)O, ZHS), where the latter is closely related to the surface redox reaction, promoting Zn2+ ion stripping/plating on the Zn anode and consequently leading to extra electron transfer. Electrochemical tests in the absence of oxygen reveal that the Pt additive has no contribution and is even counterproductive to electric conductivity but favors remarkable enhancement of the pseudocapacitance. Accordingly, it is apparent that a strong causal relationship exists between Pt and the ZHS. In consideration of the catalytic application for oxygen reduction, Pt is expected to play a vital role in enhancing the electrochemical capacity through the pseudo-Zn-air reaction. This finding introduces a new strategy for achieving high-performance aqueous zinc-ion batteries.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 7490}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Background and Objectives Previous findings on the association between hazardous drinking and HIV-risk behavior have been equivocal, varying by population and individual difference factors. This study examined associations between hazardous drinking, impulsivity, and HIV-risk behaviors among HIV-positive Russian patients with a history of injection drug use (IDU), not on antiretroviral therapy. Methods Negative binomial regression analyses of data from a randomized controlled trial were performed (N = 241). Main independent variables were the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test and the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale. Outcomes were number of condomless sexual episodes (CSE; primary), number of sexual partners, and needle-sharing frequency (secondary). Results Hazardous drinking was positively associated with the frequency of CSE (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] = 2.16, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.98-2.36). Moderate (aIRR = 0.51, 95% CI, 0.46-0.56) and high (aIRR = 0.66, 95% CI, 0.60-0.73) impulsivity were associated with fewer CSE compared with low impulsivity. Hazardous drinking (aIRR = 0.64, 95% CI, 0.52-0.79) and impulsivity (aIRR = 0.95, 95% CI, 0.94-0.96) were both associated with fewer sexual partners. Hazardous drinking and impulsivity were each associated with increased needle sharing. The association between hazardous drinking and number of needle-shares was strongest at higher impulsivity levels. Conclusion and Scientific significance Hazardous drinking may be a risk factor for CSE among HIV-positive Russian patients and may influence needle sharing. Findings contribute to our understanding of the interactive associations between hazardous drinking and impulsivity with sexual risk behaviors and needle sharing among HIV-positive Russian patients with a history of IDU.

Hamilton's followers, his peculiar doctrines were made the justification of a view of religion which I hold to be profoundly immoral--that it is our duty to bow down and worship before a Being whose moral attributes are affirmed to be unknowable by us, and to be perhaps extremely different from those which, when speaking of our fellow-creatures, we call by the same name' (pp. 273-275). Thus we see that even where the distance between the object of his inquiry and the practical wellbeing of mankind seemed farthest, still the latter was his starting point, and the doing 'a real service to philosophy' only occurred to him in connection with a still greater and more real service to those social causes for which, and which only, philosophy is worth cultivating.

Design/methodology/approach This study was a single organizational case study informed by the realist evaluation methodology. Data collection methods included key informant interviews, healthcare staff surveys, a focus group and direct observation of meetings. Data analysis focused on identifying the context-mechanism-outcome (CMO) frameworks, a heuristic used in a realist evaluation to map pathways of the interactions between program inputs and contextual conditions leading to intended and/or unintended outcomes. Findings The identified CMOs and antecedent contexts identified informed the process of revising the initial Comprehensive Framework for Integrated Healthcare Development and Implementation (CF-IHDI). The revised CF-IHDI contained six parent domains of outer setting, basic structures, people and value, intervention characteristics, organizational capabilities for change and key processes. Research limitations/implications The CMOs and core characteristics of contextual conditions that activated facilitating mechanisms can inform future studies examining healthcare integration efforts.

This paper's primary aim is to show how, and by what cultural means, Daesh became so powerful, and to study what lies behind its non-coercive power. This paper is part of an ongoing research project designed to study the different aspects of Daesh's power. Drawing on Gramsci's 'hegemonic power,' and Bourdieu's 'cultural capital', the research explains what it is in Daesh's cultural power that creates consent. In doing so, this study examines the various English and Arabic content of Daesh's official media and the documents it has released since June 2014. Additionally, data has been collected from 19 semi-structured expert interviews together with other secondary sources. The findings of the study show that Daesh's power goes beyond its coercive power. This research acknowledges that Daesh's ideology is central to its power and is present in all aspects of the Khilafah's activities, including in its multi-faceted power (i.e., its cultural, media, political and economic power).", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 7531}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Recent studies have demonstrated a strong relationship between the intestinal microbiota and the host health. As such, consumers are increasingly becoming more concerned about the potential effect of certain foods/feeds, particularly of transgenic origin on the gut microbiota. Although the European Food Safety Authority has recommended in their guidelines, to study the effect of transgenic food/feed on host-microbiota, yet, few studies have focused on the evaluation of such effects mainly due to culturing difficulties. Therefore, this study was intended to evaluate the potential adverse effects of transgenic diet consumption on some specific gut microflora (Lactobacillus group, Bifidobacterium genus, Escherichia coli subgroup and Enterococcus genus) of rabbits. A total of forty-eight rabbits were randomly assigned into four groups and fed a diet containing a variable proportion of transgenic cottonseeds at 0, 20, 30 and 40% inclusion level, respectively. Changes in the specific or total faecal bacterial population were monitored at five different experimental stages (i.e. 0, 45, 90, 135 and 180 days) using both the traditional plate count method (TM) and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). No significant differences (p > .05) were observed concerning numbers of specific bacteria or total bacteria between the control and experimental groups, though qPCR showed numerically higher values in terms of 16S rRNA gene copies as compared to the values obtained from TM. However, such numerical differences were biologically insignificant (p > .05). Similarly, no significant variations were noticed in the calculated B/E (log(10) copies of Bifidobacterium per g faces/log10 copies of E. coli genome per g faeces) ratios in all the groups. All the ratios were in the range of 1.24 to 1.30 throughout the experiment, indicating a good balance of intestinal microflora and greater resistance to intestinal disorders. It is therefore concluded that feeding transgenic cottonseeds could not adversely affect the gut microflora of rabbits during a long-term study.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 7533}

Findings Lead firms systematically separate and internalize high value-added activities in otherwise low value-added processes leading to constant reconfigurations and reorganizations of the production processes in global value chains. The study finds that similar reconfigurations may trigger different changes and changes and performance consequences may differ considerably according to the level of analysis.

The only proper marriage would be one, in which both have an independent life for themselves, without the fusion which rests on an economically compulsory community of interest, but which instead would involve taking mutual responsibility for each other out of freedom. Marriage as a community of interest inexorably signifies the degradation of the interested parties, and what is perfidious about the existing state of affairs, is that no-one, even if one knew of this, can avoid such degradation. Sometimes one might entertain the thought that it is only those who are emancipated from the pursuit of interests, that is to say the rich, who retain the possibility of a marriage without shame.

The Pd-n(L-Cys)(m) nanoclusters supported on the reducible metal oxides CeO2, TiO2 and Fe3O4 exhibit a remarkable catalytic activity towards CO oxidation, significantly higher than the reported Pd nanoparticle catalysts. The high catalytic activity of the ligand-protected clusters Pd-n(L-Cys)(m) is observed on the three reducible oxides where 100 % CO conversion occurs at 93-110 degrees C. The high activity is attributed to the ligand-protected Pd nanoclusters where the L-cysteine ligands aid in achieving monodispersity of the Pd clusters by limiting the cluster size to the active sub-2-nm region and decreasing the tendency of the clusters for agglomeration. In the case of the ceria support, a complete removal of the L-cysteine ligands results in connected agglomerated Pd clusters which are less reactive than the ligand-protected clusters. However, for the TiO2 and Fe3O4 supports, complete removal of the ligands from the Pd-n(L-Cys)(m) clusters leads to a slight decrease in activity where the T-100% CO conversion occurs at 99 degrees C and 107 degrees C, respectively. The high porosity of the TiO2 and Fe3O4 supports appears to aid in efficient encapsulation of the bare Pd-n nanoclusters within the mesoporous pores of the support.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 7544}
{"label": "NEG", "text": "Yarrowia lipolytica is widely used as a microbial producer of lipids and lipid derivatives. Here, we exploited this yeast's potential to generate aromatic amino acids by developing chassis strains optimized for the production of phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan. We engineered the shikimate pathway to overexpress a combination of Y. lipolytica and heterologous feedback-insensitive enzyme variants. Our best chassis strain displayed high levels of de novo Ehrlich metabolite production (up to 0.14 g l(-1) in minimal growth medium), which represented a 93-fold increase compared to the wild-type strain (0.0015 g l(-1)). Production was further boosted to 0.48 g l(-1) when glycerol, a low-cost carbon source, was used, concomitantly to high secretion of phenylalanine precursor (1 g l(-1)). Among these metabolites, 2-phenylethanol is of particular interest due to its rose-like flavour. We also established a production pathway for generating protodeoxyviolaceinic acid, a dye derived from tryptophan, in a chassis strain optimized for chorismate, the precursor of tryptophan. We have thus demonstrated that Y. lipolytica can serve as a platform for the sustainable de novo bio-production of high-value aromatic compounds, and we have greatly improved our understanding of the potential feedback-based regulation of the shikimate pathway in this yeast.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 7545}

In response, the purpose of this paper is to present a research model that takes information technology (IT) culture as a theoretical lens and personal innovativeness and experience in IT projects as theoretical constructs to predict behaviour and traits that explain DE success. Design/methodology/approach Based on the literature review, the authors propose hypotheses and a research model. The authors tested the model using structural equation modelling (SEM), by surveying a sample of digital entrepreneurs operating in the Yabacon Valley, Lagos, Nigeria. Findings The results indicate that IT culture is an essential predictor of achieving DE success. The results also suggest that an entrepreneur's innovativeness in IT and experience in IT projects have significant negative and positive moderating effects on the relationship between IT culture and achieving DE success. Research limitations/implications This paper taps into a new setting - DE context - by exploring the moderation effects of an entrepreneur's innovativeness in IT and experience in IT projects on the link between their IT culture and achieving a successful DE outcome. Practical implications This model offers managers an understanding of how IT culture and personal innovativeness and experience in IT work together to achieve DE success. Meanwhile, it sheds some light on managers to treat individuals with different levels of experience differently. Originality/value The authors theorise IT culture, personal innovativeness and experience in IT and show their effects on DE success, thus making an essential contribution to the information systems (ISs) and entrepreneurship research and practice. Moreover, the authors provide a novel methodology to conceptualise IT culture as a second-order hierarchical reflective construct by giving evidence that partial least squares (PLS) path modelling can assess a hierarchical model with moderating effects. This study answers scholars' call to construct more accurate explanations of innovation outcomes in an increasingly digital world.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 7568}

The authors argue that differences in financial performance may reflect not only the family's influence but also the prevalence of a stewardship-oriented culture, across varying degrees of family influence. Design/methodology/approach The measure of family influence uses the F-PEC scale: family [F], power [P], experience [E] and culture [C]. It supports cross-firm comparisons of different levels of family influence. To capture the multidimensional nature of family influence, this study uses structural equation modelling and measures the meditating effects of stewardship. Findings The results reveal a mediating effect of stewardship; family firms achieve better performance when they take advantage of and encourage stewardship attitudes among owners and leaders. Factors associated with stewardship behaviour, including stewardship motivation and stewardship culture, help explain why some family firms perform better than others. Practical implications When analysing the behaviour of family firms, interested entrepreneurs, managers and consultants should acknowledge that the family's influence entails both financial and emotional capital. The survival of the family businesses depends on balancing these aspects.

Three times during early development, on postnatal day 5 (P5), P8, and P11, C57BL/6J pups were given s.c. injection of either .2 mu g/kg IL-1 beta or 5 cc/kg injection of saline vehicle followed, after a 45 min delay, by a second injection, of either 103.9 mg/kg APAP or saline.

Interestingly, IL-1 beta-induced tail blunting was significantly lessened by APAP, an interaction that may have occurred as a result of the opposing actions of APAP and IL-1 beta on cyclooxygenase-2.

Enantioselective C(sp(3))-C(sp(3)) coupling is challenging, especially of alkyl electrophiles without an activating group (aryl, vinyl, carbonyl). Here, we report a strategy based on nickel hydride addition to internal olefins followed by nickel-catalysed alkyl-alkyl coupling. This strategy enables the enantioselective cross-coupling of non-activated alkyl halides with alkenyl boronates to produce chiral alkyl boronates. Employing readily available and stable olefins as pro-chiral nucleophiles, the coupling proceeds under mild conditions and exhibits broad scope and high functional-group tolerance. Applications for the functionalization of natural products and drug molecules, as well as the synthesis of chiral building blocks and a key intermediate to (S)-(+)-pregabalin, are demonstrated. Methods for producing organic molecules rich in sp(3)-hybridized carbon centres can be particularly useful for drug development. Now, it has been shown that the enantioselective cross-coupling of non-activated alkyl halides with alkenyl boronates enables the synthesis of chiral alkyl boronates.

The CMC coating was supplemented with isolated SA or SA combined with REO (0.5% or 1%). The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) evaluation indicated that the REO was chiefly composed of 1,8-cineole (25.21%) and alpha-pinene (22.34%). The microbiological evaluation revealed that the growth of mesophilic bacteria, psychrotrophic bacteria, Pseudomonas spp., lactic acid bacteria, and Enterobacteriaceae was considerably slower in rainbow trout meat coated with CMC, SA, and REO (0.5 or 1%) relative to the control. Such coatings also improved the pH, water-holding capacity, cooking yield index, and sensory characteristics of rainbow trout fillets. The total volatile basic nitrogen content, peroxide value, and amount of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances were significantly lower in the experimental samples relative to the control. Hence, we introduced a novel CMC coating containing SA and REO (0.5 or 1%) that improves the shelf life and quality of refrigerated rainbow trout meat.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 7614}

A different approach of producing high fiber bread with improved quality can be produced using white flour with added mill fractions, but the addition of mill fractions has been shown to adversely affect the dough characteristics. Therefore, the effect of adding mill fractions on the rheological characteristics of dough was investigated using Brabender Farinograph and Extensograph with the major objective of eliminating their deleterious effects on dough quality, mainly by using psyllium husk, and also reported as an excellent source of soluble dietary fiber. Addition of fine bran, coarse bran, and raw wheat germ decreased the extensibility and resistance to extension and area under curve, lower dough stability, but enhanced water absorption and peak time. Addition of psyllium husk, though reduced the extensibility, but did not affect the area under the curve adversely, thus overcame some of the negative effects on rheological characteristics of the white flour dough. It was concluded that the use of psyllium husk will evidently help the bakers to produce nutritious and acceptable quality Arabic bread.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 7616}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "The underlying molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of endometrial cancer (EC) are still not well understood. Our goal was to investigate the composition of the endometrial microbiota and the association with inflammatory cytokines in EC. Endometrial microbiota profiles of women with EC (n = 25) and benign uterine lesions (BUL, n = 25) were assessed by 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing. The expression levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and interleukin-17 (IL-17) mRNA and protein in the endometrial tissues of the two groups were determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot, respectively. There were significant differences in alpha diversity based on the observed operational taxonomic units (P = .002), Pielou evenness (P = .001), and Shannon index (P < .001) between EC and BUL groups. Significant differences were also found in Bray-Curtis (P = .001) and unweighted UniFrac (P = .001) beta diversity measures between the two groups. At the genus level, Micrococcus was more abundant in the EC group. Pseudoramibacter_Eubacterium, Rhodobacter, Vogesella, Bilophila, Rheinheimera, and Megamonas were enriched in the BUL group. There were no differences in IL-8 and IL-17 protein levels between the two groups, except IL-6 protein levels. However, the mRNA expression levels of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-17 were significantly different. Moreover, the relative abundances of Micrococcus was positively correlated with IL-6, and IL-17 mRNA levels. In conclusion, our results suggested that dysbiosis of endometrial microbiota and the inflammatory cytokines were associated with Micrococcus in EC patients, which might be useful for exploration of the mechanism between the endometrial microbiota and inflammatory responses in future studies.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 7621}

The current perception was addressed and analyzed to understand the trends. So, this study examined various parameters such as e-services quality, food quality (FQ), safety measures (SM), customer satisfaction (CS) and customer loyalty (CL) in correlation to each other. Design/methodology/approach An online survey was conducted for users of the online food delivery services to understand the intentions during the month of June 2020. The total number of responses gathered were 201. The responses collected were analyzed based on the constructs formed for the following tests: reliability, convergent and discriminant analysis. Also, principal component analysis was performed to ensure that the variables are correlated to each other. This ensured that the structural equation model built is valid and of best fit. The hypotheses were tested for the discussed variables, and the results were presented accordingly. Findings The research has indicated that FQ plays a vital role for CS which indirectly influences CL. Also, the SM adopted by a restaurant and delivery service will help retain their customer base, thus ensuring loyalty. Practical implications The study will help managers of restaurants and online food platforms reorient their business model and framework according to the parameters that affect the mindset of the consumer and also help improve the retention of their customer base. Originality/value This study is original in nature and takes onto account the COVID-19 situation.

Cleaning tests were performed on both artificially tarnished prototypes and naturally tarnished objects after characterizing them; scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDX) were used to characterize the artificially tarnished prototypes, and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) was used to characterize the naturally tarnished objects. The aggressiveness of the baths was analyzed by measuring the leached amount obtained through atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) and SEM. The procedures used for cleaning the artificially tarnished prototypes served as a guide for cleaning two naturally tarnished objects: a halo and a crown. Cleaning was guided by the presented method's characteristics as well as the object's unique characteristics and condition.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 7635}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "We studied the effects of tillage, crop residues, and green manure on soil carbon pools and hydrolytic enzyme activity in a sandy loam after five cycles of the rice-wheat system (RWS). Four main plot treatments in rice were combinations of wheat straw and Sesbania green manure (GM) management: (1) puddled transplanted rice (PTR) with no wheat straw, (2) PTR with 25% wheat stubbles (12-15 cm long) retained, (3) PTR with no wheat straw plus GM, and (4) PTR with 25% wheat stubbles plus GM. Three subplots treatments in subsequent wheat were (1) conventional tillage with rice straw removed, (2) zero tillage (ZT) with rice straw removed, and (3) ZT with 100% rice straw retained as a surface mulch. The results showed that PTR with wheat stubbles retained plus GM and ZT wheat with rice straw retained (ZTW(RS100)) significantly (p) increased all the carbon pools and hydrolytic enzymes except phenol oxidase and peroxidase activities. The carbon management index under ZTW(RS100) retained was significantly higher than zero-till or conventional till wheat without residue. The principal component analysis identified active carbon, less labile carbon pools; xylanase and dehydrogenase hydrolytic enzymes as the most reliable sensitive indicators for assessing soil quality for conservation agriculture (CA) - based practices in RWS. The study showed that adoption of PTR with 25%-anchored wheat stubbles retained plus GM in rice followed by ZTW(RS100) in wheat was the best crop production strategy for enhanced carbon pools, hydrolytic enzymatic activities and gives an idea of its overall fitness for carrying out ecosystem functions.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 7638}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Objectives: Little is known about the longitudinal course of pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS) because existing literature is primarily cross-sectional. To begin to address this gap, two digital platforms were used to prospectively monitor neuropsychiatric symptoms in children with PANS. The aim was to identify baseline clinical characteristics that would predict the course of neuropsychiatric symptoms over 12 weeks. We compared relative compliance between two electronic data acquisition platforms and evaluated agreement between parent-child ratings of symptoms. Methods: For 12 weeks, 20 children with PANS and their parents completed weekly rating scales of neuropsychiatric symptoms on Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) and concurrently parents completed tri-weekly ratings on My Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal Infections (PANDAS) Chart, a symptom monitoring website. Longitudinal data were analyzed by using regression analyses. Results: Greater duration of time between onset of PANS and study enrollment was associated with worsening of parent-rated neuropsychiatric symptoms over 12 weeks (p = 0.05). Higher scores on parents' Caregiver Burden Inventory at baseline predicted that children would report more severe symptoms over the 12-week period (p = 0.01). Compliance rates for parents were 86.3% for the weekly REDCap PANS Symptoms Rating Scale compared with 53.8% for the tri-weekly My PANDAS Chart ratings. There was moderate agreement between children and parents on the PANS Symptom Rating Scale (r = 0.55, p < 0.0001). Conclusion: Our study highlights the utility of electronic methods for tracking longitudinal symptoms in children with PANS and suggests that particular baseline characteristics (e.g., delay in identification and treatment of PANS, greater caregiver burden) may be indicative of a differential trajectory of PANS course, with more severe symptoms over the short term. clinicaltrials.gov NCT04382716.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 7656}

The sizes of exosomes derived from human bone marrow tissues were validated by the nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) method. CD63 and TSG101 expressions in exosomes were analyzed by western blot analysis. The profiles and differential expression of circRNAs in bone-derived exosomes were characterized by high-throughput sequencing. Herein, circular structures and expression of circRNAs were verified by Sanger sequencing and real-time polymerase chain reaction, respectively. The circRNA-miRNA-mRNA networks were predicted using the Cytoscape software. And we detected the effect of circ_0014614 on the transformation of K562 cells into megakaryocytes. Exosomes derived from the bone marrow of ET patients and healthy volunteers showed a diameter between 70 and 140 nm and expressed high CD63 and TSG101. Meanwhile, the circRNA profiles were significantly altered in bone marrow-derived exosomes from ET patients, among which circDAP3, circASXL1, and circRUNX1 were significantly downregulated in ET patients, thus conferring a new insight into the role of circRNAs in the pathogenesis of ET. Besides this, circRNA-encoding genes and miRNA-mRNA networks targeted by this three circRNA were involved in various biological processes and signaling pathways.

The average values (n = 3) of the total content (mg.kg(-1)) on day 120 in IBM were in the following order: Zn (404.33) > Cu (86.33) > Pb (71.2) > Cr (34.33) > As (28.0) > Ni (13.83) > Mo (2.86) > Se (1.38) > Cd (1.32) > Hg (0.39) and in NBM: Zn (466.0) > Cu (112.23) > Pb (73.23) > Cr (35.33) > As (29.67) > Ni (14.37) > Mo (3.23) > Se (1.55) > Cd (1.38) > Hg (0.38). The values complied with the Austrian Compost Standard for Landscaping and Land Rehabilitation and the Peruvian Standard for Nonorganic Agriculture. Significant differences were observed in some elements (p < 0.05) between 0 and 120 days in both types of pile (IBM and NBM). Conclusions. For nonorganic agriculture in Peru, urban compost is recommended, whereby raw organic materials are inoculated with beneficial microorganisms during the composting process to reduce the bioavailability of Cu and Zn, as these elements showed less bioavailability than noninoculated piles. The composting process for both piles (IBM and NBM) reduced the solubility in Cu, Pb, and Zn.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 7675}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Nowadays it is customary to incorporate emotions as explanatory variables of protest participation, since numerous studies have provided evidence for their relevance. However, the incorporation of emotions in quantitative research continues to emphasise the effect of a limited set of emotions (normally one or two with negative valence, such as anger or contempt) that are modelled as mediators between non-emotional motives and participation. This makes it difficult to test the joint effect that multiple emotions appear to have, as has been reported in qualitative research. The present research aims to address these gaps in the quantitative literature by applying structural equation modelling to a survey administered to a random sample of 500 inhabitants of a region of Chile in which a long cycle of territorial protests occurred. Our results confirm some hypotheses derived from qualitative research by showing that emotions are in fact experienced in arrays, that emotions with positive valence play a relevant role in explaining participation, and that several emotions mediate the effect of non-emotional motives and participation. It is also clear that emotions experienced by the population are significantly interrelated, thus a study of the direct or mediating effects of any given emotion must also address other emotions experienced intensely by subjects. This evidence could help to modify and improve the way in which emotions are integrated into formal quantitative models of protest participation.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 7680}

During a complete participatory geo-analysis effort, the various participants should concentrate on their familiar work and fully exploit their talents to perform work collaboratively. Therefore, we propose an activity-based process construction method to assist different participants in understanding the geo-analysis process and in concentrating on their familiar work. Eight core activities are established for the geo-analysis process: (1) context definition and resource collection, (2) data processing, (3) data analysis, (4) data visualization, (5) geo-analysis model construction, (6) model effectiveness evaluation, (7) geographical simulation, and (8) decision making. By using a visualization-based method, different activities can be linked together to represent the entire analytical process. Moreover, each activity is designed via a specialized web-based workspace in which online tools and resources are accessed to assist the participants with their geo-analysis practices. A prototype system was developed based on the proposed method, and a case study on a participatory risk assessment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was demonstrated using this system.

It belongs to the genus Orbivirus of family Reoviridae and subfamily Sedoreovirinae. The genome of BTV is 10 segmented dsRNA that codes for 7 structural and 4 nonstructural proteins, of which VP2 was reported to be serotype-specific and a major antigenic determinant. Objective: It is important to know the circulating serotypes in a particular geographical location for effective control of the disease. The present study unravels the molecular evolution of the circulating BTV serotypes during 2014-2018 in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh states of India. Methods: Multiple sequence alignment with available BTV serotypes in GenBank and phylogenetic analysis were performed for the partial VP2 sequences of major circulating BTV serotypes during the study period. Results: The multiple sequence alignment of circulating serotypes with respective reference isolates revealed variations in antigenic VP2. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that the major circulating serotypes were grouped into eastern topotypes (BTV-1, BTV-2, BTV-4, and BTV-16) and Western topotypes (BTV-5, BTV-12, and BTV-24).

{"label": "NEG", "text": "In contrast to the well-documented impacts of implementing performance management (PM) systems, the evolution of PM systems' design is understudied, despite the understanding that PM requires ongoing maintenance, continuing reconsideration, and constant adaption to local circumstances. This study employs a process perspective on PM by focusing on the four generations of the Israeli police PM system implemented from 1999 to 2016. Data are drawn from official documentation and interviews with various stakeholders who were involved in the system's re-designs. PM evolution emerged as a decentralization process, during which Chiefs were gradually given more power, partially at the expense of top management power, through increased discretion, self-learning features, enhanced understanding and decoupling of measurement-incentives. Shifting from \"one size fits all\" to a more \"tailor-made\" approach, and from top-down control to user management, PM decentralization exemplifies constructive efforts to bridge the well-known gap between policy aims and outcomes in performance-oriented reforms.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 7709}

However, adherence to these medications is still suboptimal worldwide. This retrospective observational study aimed to assess the adherence to post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) medications, along with predictors of non-adherence. Methods We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study to assess the adherence to post-PCI medications by determining the rate of prescription refills for 12 months after discharge among STEMI patients, as well as predictors of non-adherence. Adherence was assessed by medication availability 80% of the time monitored by the prescription refills rate for 1 year post-discharge. Results and discussion A total of 1334 patients who presented with STEMI and underwent primary PCI were included in our retrospective analysis. The majority of patients included were male (96%) with a mean age of 51 +/- 10.2 years. The overall adherence rate for all medications was only 28.4%, with an individual adherence rate of 50.5% for aspirin, 49.9% for P2Y12 inhibitors, 48.1% for statins, 39.6% for beta-blockers and 42.9% for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB). Factors that increased the likelihood of non-adherence were prolonged hospital length of stay and getting the medications with charge (aOR = 1.94, 95% CI 1.1-3.3; p-value = 0.017, aOR = 1.87, 95% CI 1.1-3.3; p-value = 0.029, respectively), while having a regular follow-up after discharge and attending the first clinic appointment were significantly associated with decreased likelihood of non-adherence (aOR = 0.01, 95% CI 0.004-0.04; p-value < 0.001, aOR = 0.06, 95% CI 0.03-0.1; p-value < 0.001, respectively).

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancies in the world and is associated with high mortality. Ionizing radiation (IR)-based therapy causes DNA damage, exerting a curative effect; however, DNA damage repair signaling pathways lead to HCC resistance to IR-based therapy. RAD21 is a component of the cohesion complex, crucial for chromosome segregation and DNA damage repair, while it is still unclear whether RAD21 is implicated in DNA damage and influences IR sensitivity in HCC. The current research explores the effect and upstream regulatory mechanism of RAD21 on IR sensitivity in HCC. In the present study, RAD21 mRNA and protein expression were increased within HCC tissue samples, particularly within IR-insensitive HCC tissues. The overexpression of RAD21 partially attenuated the roles of IR in HCC by promoting the viability and suppressing the apoptosis of HCC cells. RAD21 overexpression reduced the culture medium 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine concentration and decreased the protein levels of gamma H2AX and ATM, suggesting that RAD21 overexpression attenuated IR treatment-induced DNA damage to HCC cells. miR-320b targeted RAD21 3MODIFIER LETTER PRIME-UTR to inhibit RAD21 expression. In HCC tissues, particularly in IR-insensitive HCC tissues, miR-320b expression was significantly downregulated. miR-320b inhibition also attenuated IR treatment-induced DNA damage to HCC cells; more importantly, RAD21 silencing significantly attenuated the effects of miR-320b inhibition on IR treatment-induced DNA damage, suggesting that miR-320b plays a role through targeting RAD21. In conclusion, an miR-320b/RAD21 axis modulating HCC sensitivity to IR treatment through acting on IR-induced DNA damage was demonstrated. The miR-320b/RAD21 axis could be a novel therapeutic target for further study of HCC sensitivity to IR treatment.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 7728}

Besides the disease itself growing globally, this pandemic has inflicted many other healthcare problems. This study aims to look at the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on paediatric surgical accidents. Methods: A retrospective review of all patients under 18 years of age admitted to a tertiary paediatric surgical unit with accidents was done between January to May 2020 (COVID-19 social isolation period). Comparison was made with cases between January to May 2018 and 2019. Inclusion diagnoses include foreign body ingestion (FBI), scald injury, animal bite, and fall. Demographic data including age and gender, details of injury and treatment, and length of hospitalization were recorded. Statistical analysis was performed by Fisher exact test and statistical significance was defined as P <= .05. Results: A total of 35 patients were admitted during the period 1-5/2020 compared to 28 patients in 1-5/2019 and 16 patients in 1-5/2018. Median age at presentation is 3 years. Diagnoses include FBI, animal bite, scald injury and fall. Thirteen required surgical intervention including oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (20%), wound debridement (13%), wound suturing (67%). Mean length of hospital stay was 2.89 days. The proportion of domestic accidents in 2020 increased compared with the same period in 2018 and 2019 (P-values = .0001, .0259). Non-food foreign body ingestions at home during COVID19 increased significantly (P-values = .0018, .0223). Surgical intervention required for domestic accidents in 2020 also increased (P-values = .1223, .107). Conclusion: The social isolation imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic has caused an increase in paediatric domestic accidents requiring admission to our surgical ward.

One widely used validated tool is the Objective Structured Assessment of Debriefing (OSAD), which was originally developed in English. The aim of this study was to translate the OSAD into German, and to evaluate the reliability and validity of this German version (G-OSAD) according the 'Standards of Educational and Psychological Measurement'. In Phase 1, the validity evidence based on content was established by a multistage cross-cultural adaptation translation of the original English OSAD. Additionally, we collected expert input on the adequacy of the content of the G-OSAD to measure debriefing quality. In Phase 2, three trained raters assessed 57 video recorded debriefings to gather validity evidence based on internal structure. Interrater reliability, test-retest reliability, internal consistency, and composite reliability were examined. Finally, we assessed the internal structure by applying confirmatory factorial analysis. The expert input supported the adequacy of the content of the G-OSAD to measure debriefing quality. Interrater reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient) was excellent for the average ratings (three raters: ICC = 0.848; two raters: ICC = 0.790), and good for the single rater (ICC = 0.650). Test-retest reliability was excellent (ICC = 0.976), internal consistency was acceptable (Cronbach's alpha = 0.865), and composite reliability was excellent (omega = 0.93). Factor analyses supported the unidimensionality of the G-OSAD, which indicates that these G-OSAD ratings measure debriefing quality as intended. The G-OSAD shows good psychometric qualities to assess debriefing quality, which are comparable to the original OSAD. Thus, this G-OSAD is a tool that has the potential to optimise the quality of debriefings in German-speaking countries.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 7750}

Here we examined the efficacy of transferring this technology toward development of lure-and-kill ovitraps targeting Aedes aegypti (L.) and Aedes albopictus (Skuse) female mosquitoes. Insectary, simulated field and semi-field experiments demonstrated that two mosquito-specific yeast interfering RNA pesticides induce high levels of mortality among larvae of both species in treated large volume containers. Small-scale field trials conducted in Trinidad, West Indies demonstrated that large volume ovitrap containers baited with inactivated yeast tablets lure significantly more gravid females than traps containing only water and were highly attractive to both A. aegypti and A. albopictus females.

On the other hand, deep brain stimulation (DBS) has demonstrated success in other neurological and psychiatric disorders leading to great interest in DBS as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease. Materials and Methods We review the literature on 1) circuit dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease and 2) DBS for Alzheimer's disease. Human and animal studies are reviewed individually. Results There is accumulating evidence of neural circuit dysfunction at the structural, functional, electrophysiological, and neurotransmitter level. Recent evidence from humans and animals indicate that DBS has the potential to restore circuit dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease, similarly to other movement and psychiatric disorders, and may even slow or reverse the underlying disease pathophysiology. Conclusions DBS is an intriguing potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease, targeting circuit dysfunction as a novel therapeutic target. However, further exploration of the basic disease pathology and underlying mechanisms of DBS is necessary to better understand how circuit dysfunction can be restored. Additionally, robust clinical data in the form of ongoing phase III clinical trials are needed to validate the efficacy of DBS as a viable treatment.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 7795}

Main findings The frequency of chromosome abnormalities in infertile patients is 0.595%-0.64%. YCMs are observed in 2%-10% of severe oligospermic men. High incidence of spermatozoa with chromosomal abnormalities has been reported in advanced oligospermia and asthenozoospermia that require ICSI.

Innovative solutions can be developed to enable the use of this technology during surgery. The authors developed and iteratively optimized a pipeline to construct, visualize, and register intraoperative holographic models of patient landmarks during spinal fusion surgery. Methods. The study was carried out in two phases. In phase 1, the custom intraoperative pipeline to generate patient-specific holographic models was developed over 7 patients. In phase 2, registration accuracy was optimized iteratively for 6 patients in a real-time operative setting. Results. In phase 1, an intraoperative pipeline was successfully employed to generate and deploy patient-specific holographic models. In phase 2, the registration error with the native hand-gesture registration was 20.2 +/- 10.8 mm (n = 7 test points). Custom controller-based registration significantly reduced the mean registration error to 4.18 +/- 2.83 mm (n = 24 test points, P < .01). Accuracy improved over time (B = -.69, P < .0001) with the final patient achieving a registration error of 2.30 +/- .58 mm. Across both phases, the average model generation time was 18.0 +/- 6.1 minutes (n = 6) for isolated spinal hardware and 33.8 +/- 8.6 minutes (n = 6) for spinal anatomy. Conclusions. A custom pipeline is described for the generation of intraoperative 3D holographic models during spine surgery.

As such, this study aims to evaluate the effect of tunnel shape on joint biomechanics. Finite element models of an ACLR were constructed with different shapes (circular, oval, rounded rectangular, rectangular, and gourd-shaped) and diameters (7.5, 8.5, and 9.5 mm) for the bone tunnel. A combined loading of 103 N anterior tibial load, 7.5 Nm internal tibial moment and 6.9 Nm valgus tibial moment was applied at a joint flexion angle of 20 degrees. Joint kinematics and the strain energy density (SED) on the articular cartilage were compared among the different groups. The results showed that conventional ACLR (circular tunnel) lead to an increase in joint kinematics over the intact joint, a lower ligament force and a higher SED on the lateral tibial cartilage. ACLR using the other tunnel shapes resulted in even greater joint kinematics, lower graft force and greater SED on the lateral tibial cartilage. Increasing the tunnel diameter better restored joint kinematics, graft force and articular SED, bringing these values closer to those from the intact knee. In conclusion, increasing the tunnel diameter may be more effective than changing the tunnel shape for restoring joint functionality after ACLR.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 7824}

Peptidyl arginine deiminase-4 (PAD4) is a member of the PAD enzyme family and plays a critical role in inflammatory reactions and neutrophil extracellular trap formation in a variety of pathological conditions. It has been reported that PAD4 inhibition can protect certain organs from ischemic injury. In this study, we aimed to understand the mode of action of PAD4 in renal ischemia-reperfusion-mediated acute lung injury. Bilateral renal pedicle occlusion was induced for 30 min followed by reperfusion for 24 h. A specific inhibitor of PAD4, GSK484, was delivered via intraperitoneal injection to alter the PAD4 activity. The pulmonary PAD4 expression, pulmonary impairment, neutrophil infiltration, Cit-H3 expression, neutrophil extracellular trap formation, inflammatory cytokine secretion, and pulmonary apoptosis were analyzed. We found that renal ischemia reperfusion was associated with pulmonary pathological changes and increases in neutrophil infiltration, neutrophil extracellular trap formation, and inflammatory cytokine secretion in the lungs of the recipient animals. Suppression of PAD4 by GSK484 reduced remote lung injury by mitigating neutrophil infiltration, neutrophil extracellular trap formation, apoptosis, and inflammatory factor secretion. Our findings demonstrate that specific PAD4 inhibition by GSK484 may be an effective strategy to attenuate distant lung injury complicating renal ischemia-reperfusion injury.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 7850}

Considering that genotoxic effects are associated with an increased risk of developing cancer, the aim of this study was to examine the recombinogenic, genotoxic, and cytotoxic effects of Aza using Somatic Mutation and Recombination Test (SMART) in Drosophila melanogaster, as well as comet and micronucleus assays in mouse bone marrow cells. Further, the adverse effects of Aza were determined in mouse hepatic and renal tissues using histopathological analysis. Data demonstrated that Aza induced significant increased genotoxicity in D. melanogaster and mouse bone marrow cells at all concentrations tested. Homologous recombination was the predominant genotoxic event noted for the first time to be initiated by Aza in SMART. In histopathological analysis, Aza did not show any marked toxic activity in mouse hepatic and renal tissues. Therefore, the high rate of neoplasms reported in patients with long-term use of Aza may be attributed, at least partially, to the genotoxic action of this drug.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 7867}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "The effects of changing climate and disturbance on mountain forest carbon (C) stocks vary with tree species distributions and over elevational gradients. Warming can not only increase C uptake by stimulating productivity at high elevations but also enhance C release by increasing respiration and the frequency, intensity and size of wildfires. To understand the consequences of climate change for temperate mountain forests, we simulated interactions among climate, wildfire, tree species and their combined effects on regional C stocks in forests of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, USA (GYE) with the LANDIS-II landscape change model. Simulations used historical climate and future potential climate represented by downscaled projections from five general circulation models (GCMs) that bracket the range of variability under the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5 emissions scenario. Total ecosystem C increased by 67% through 2100 in simulations with historical climate, and by 38%-69% with GCM climate. Differences in C uptake among GCMs resulted primarily from variation in area burned, not productivity. Warming increased productivity by extending the growing season, especially near upper tree line, but did not offset biomass losses to fire. By 2100, simulated area burned increased by 27%-215% under GCM climate, with the largest increases after 2050. With warming >3 degrees C in mean annual temperature, the increased frequency of large fires reduced live C stocks by 4%-36% relative to the control, historical climate scenario. However, relative losses in total C were delayed under GCMs with large increases in summer precipitation and buffered by C retained in soils and the wood of fire-killed trees. Increasing fire size limited seed dispersal, and reductions in soil moisture limited seedling establishment; both effects will likely constrain long-term forest regeneration and C uptake. Synthesis. Forests in the GYE can maintain a C sink through the mid-century in a warming climate but continued warming may cause the loss of forest area, live above-ground biomass and, ultimately, ecosystem C. Future changes in C stocks in similar forests throughout western North America will depend on regional thresholds for extensive wildfire and forest regeneration and therefore, changes may occur earlier in drier regions.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 7874}

The assessment of accuracy and efficiency is carried out for an exemplary two-phase material.

From the inability of reason to establish this principle as a necessary law for the acquisition of all experience, he inferred the nullity of all the attempts of reason to pass the region of the empirical.

The only explanation of this is, that the nerves which before stretched downwards from the brain to the hand, and then terminated in the arm close to the elbow, were there moved in the same way as they required to be moved before in the hand for the purpose of impressing on the mind residing in the brain the sensation of pain in this or that finger.

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Purpose The purpose of this study is to develop a reconstruction and measurement system for data analysis using ultrasonic transmission tomography. The problem of reconstruction from the projection is encountered in practical implementation, which consists in reconstructing an image that is an estimation of an unknown object from a finite set of projection data. Reconstructive algorithms used in transmission tomography are based on linear mathematical models, which makes it necessary to process non-linear data into estimates for a finite number of projections. The application of transformation methods requires building a mathematical model in which the projection data forming the known and unknown quantities are functions with arguments from a continuous set of real numbers, determining the function describing the unknown quantities sought in the form of inverse relation and adapting it to operate on discrete and noisy data. This was done by designing a tomographic device and proprietary algorithms capable of reconstructing two-dimensional images regardless of the size, shape, location or number of inclusions hidden in the examined object. Design/methodology/approach The application consists of a device and measuring sensors, as well as proprietary algorithms for image reconstruction. Ultrasonic transmission tomography makes it possible to analyse processes occurring in an object without interfering with the examined object. The proposed solution uses algorithms based on ray integration, the Fermat principle and deterministic methods. Two applications were developed, one based on C and implemented on the embedded device, while the other application was made in Matlab. Findings Research shows that ultrasonic transmission tomography provides an effective analysis of tested objects in closed tanks. Research limitations/implications In the presented technique, the use of ultrasonic absorption wave has been limited. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of such a solution has been confirmed.

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Background Diastolic dysfunction in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is common, but its assessment is difficult using conventional echocardiography. Aims To assess left atrial (LA) function in HCM by longitudinal strain and determine its role in understanding of symptoms. Methods We studied 144 patients divided into 3 age- and sex-matched groups: 48 consecutive patients with HCM, 48 control subjects, and 48 athlete subjects. We assessed LA function by conventional echocardiographic parameters and by longitudinal atrial strain (early-diastolic left atrial strain during reservoir phase [LASr]; end-diastolic left atrial strain during conduit phase; end-systolic peak of the left atrial strain during contraction phase). Results NYHA classification was as follows in HCM group: I in 46%, II in 31%, III in 19%, and IV in 4%. Conventional echocardiographic parameters of diastolic function were depressed in the HCM group as compared to the control and athlete groups, but not related to symptoms. All longitudinal atrial strain parameters were significantly reduced in HCM group as compared to two groups (P < .0001). LASr was significantly correlated to peak VO2 (r = 0.44, P = .01) and was the best parameter for detecting symptomatic patients presenting with HCM, with a cutoff value of 15%: Sensitivity was 71%, specificity was 79%, PPV was 77%, and NPV was 73%. Conclusion Assessment of LA function in HCM is feasible using longitudinal strain, and this technique is more reliable than conventional echocardiographic parameters for the understanding of determinants of symptoms.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 7911}

Moreover, the dry and wet shear strength exhibit positive correlation with the proportion of GDE added. Even at a relatively small proportion of GDE (33% of the weight of dry tannin), the dry and 24 h cold water shear strengths of the bonded plywood satisfied the requirements of relevant standard (GB/T 9846-2015, >= 0.7 MPa).

The threespine stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, is known for its ecological plasticity resulting in three major ecotypes, a marine type, a migrating anadromous type and a resident freshwater type. We provide the first comparative study of the pattern of the head lateral line system of North Sea populations representing these three ecotypes including a brackish spawning population. We found no distinct difference in the pattern of the head lateral line system between the three ecotypes but significant differences in neuromast numbers. The anadromous and the brackish populations had distinctly less neuromasts than their freshwater and marine conspecifics. This difference in neuromast number between marine and anadromous threespine stickleback points to differences in swimming behavior. We also found sexual dimorphism in neuromast number with males having more neuromasts than females in the anadromous, brackish and the freshwater populations. But no such dimorphism occurred in the marine population. Our results suggest that the head lateral line of the three ecotypes is under divergent hydrodynamic constraints. Additionally, sexual dimorphism points to divergent niche partitioning of males and females in the anadromous and freshwater but not in the marine populations.

The results indicate that the trade linkage between Africa and the rest of the global economy is substantial, with the total trade linkage index having an average value of 87%. We find that China, USA, UK, Japan, EU and Canada dominate Africa's trade and therefore have the potential to spread trade shocks to it. The results further indicate that apart from the BRIC, other regional trading blocs such as Asia, the Americas, and Europe play influential roles in Africa's trade. Overall, the findings show that African economies are predominantly net receivers of trade shocks originating from the aforementioned dominant sources. We conclude that these patterns of cross-country trade shock spillovers, coupled with the ongoing challenges of legitimacy facing the World Trade Organisation, would likely influence Africa's move from multilateralism to multi-polarism in the years to come.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 7998}

Methods: We conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews using a constructive-grounded theory design. Twelve SDMs, who were also family members for 11 patients, were interviewed at two time points (except one) for a total of 21 in-depth interviews. Results: Participants described that caregiving is often the central role which they identify as their top priority and around which they coordinate and to some extent subordinate their other roles. In addition to caregiving, they participated in a wide variety of roles, which were sometimes in conflict, as they became caregivers for a loved one with chronic and complex needs. SDMs described the caregiver role as complex and intense that lead to physical, emotional, social, and economic burdens. Conclusion: SDMs report high levels of burdens in caring for a person with a prolonged disorder of consciousness.

We illustrate the ability of the proposed approach to flexibly estimate causal effects in high dimensions and appropriately quantify uncertainty.

{"label": "NEG", "text": "For an efficient allocation of the limited resources to alien species management, the most damaging species should be prioritised. Comparing alien species based on their impacts is not straightforward, as the same species can cause different types and magnitudes of impacts when introduced to different contexts, making it difficult to summarise its overall impact. The Environmental Impact Classification for Alien Taxa (EICAT) systematically summarises and compares detrimental impacts caused by alien populations to native biota and has been adopted by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. For each alien species, all reported impacts to native populations within the introduced range are classified into five levels of severity, from negligible impact to irreversible local extinction. Currently, EICAT only compares alien species based on their highest impact, thereby ignoring variation in impact magnitudes. Here, we used information on the variation in impact magnitudes of alien species to estimate their risks to cause high impacts if introduced to a novel environment. We demonstrate the usefulness of this approach by classifying the global impacts of alien ungulates. We found impact reports for 27 of the 66 alien ungulate species established worldwide, highlighting substantial knowledge gaps in invasion science. We classified a total of 441 impacts to native fauna and flora caused by these 27 species. Twenty-six of the species were found to cause harmful impacts (native population declines or local extinctions). Mouflon (Ovis orientalis, Gmelin, 1774) and dromedary (Camelus dromedarius, Linnaeus, 1758) had a higher risk of causing local extinctions if introduced to a novel environment than sika deer (Cervus nippon, Temminck, 1838) and goats (Capra hircus, Linnaeus, 1758).

The main aim of this paper is to analyze energy and economic performances of a point-focus CPV system for a residential user when its installation site varies. Three locations, Riyadh, Copenhagen, and Palermo, characterized by very different weather conditions are chosen. A model that links the electrical power of a triple-junction (TJ) cell with its temperature and concentrated radiation incident on it is experimentally developed to evaluate the energy performance of the CPV system. A comparison of the three localities for typical winter and summer sunny days indicates that the higher values of the TJ cell temperature are reached in summer, over 70 degrees C at Riyadh, and its electrical power is reduced compared to a winter day. In winter, a TJ cell in Riyadh supplies an electric power of about 20% higher than that in other two cities, while in summer, the maximum power is observed at Copenhagen. On the contrary, the electrical producibility also depends on the sunlight daily hours number during the year. Hence, considering the real distribution of direct normal irradiance (DNI) and the environmental temperature for each locality, a CPV system composed of modules of 90 cells adopted for a residential user is sized. The electric producibility of the CPV system, by varying its module number, is evaluated for different localities together with the optimal number of the modules which is able to maximize the investment profitability.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 8050}

We investigated the effects of different stratification on energy transfers across scales and kinetic-potential energy exchange in Fourier space in the inverse energy cascade range. When the stratification is weak, almost all the kinetic energy flux in the inertial range comes from two-dimensional and three-dimensional (2D-3D) coupling interactions and 2D dynamics dominates at very large scales, which are similar to those in the purely rotating case. However, compared with the purely rotating case, the inverse cascade is weakened through the kinetic-potential energy exchange induced by 3D wave-vortical interactions. The total kinetic-potential energy exchange is found to oscillate at later times, which is produced by 2D inertia-gravity waves with fixed wave numbers. When the stratification is strong, the distributions of decomposed kinetic fluxes are different from those in purely rotating case. The magnitude of 2D-3D coupling energy flux becomes small and 3D-mode energy flux is important near the forcing scales. Besides, homo- and heterochiral energy fluxes are different in the inverse cascade. The kinetic-potential energy exchange under strong stratification mainly comes from 3D modes and wave-vortical interactions. Strengths of stratification negligibly affect properties of locality of the kinetic energy cascade, which is infrared local and ultraviolet nonlocal.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 8071}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Aim To describe diabetes nurses' perspectives on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with diabetes and diabetes services across Europe. Methods An online survey developed using a rapid Delphi method. The survey was translated into 17 different languages and disseminated electronically in 27 countries via national diabetes nurse networks. Results Survey responses from 1829 diabetes nurses were included in the analysis. The responses indicated that 28% (n = 504) and 48% (n = 873) of diabetes nurses felt the COVID-19 pandemic had impacted 'a lot' on the physical and psychological risks of people with diabetes, respectively. The following clinical problems were identified as having increased 'a lot': anxiety 82% (n = 1486); diabetes distress 65% (n = 1189); depression 49% (n = 893); acute hyperglycaemia 39% (n = 710) and foot complications 18% (n = 323). Forty-seven percent (n = 771) of respondents identified that the level of care provided to people with diabetes had declined either extremely or quite severely. Self-management support, diabetes education and psychological support were rated by diabetes nurse respondents as having declined extremely or quite severely during the COVID-19 pandemic by 31% (n = 499), 63% (n = 1,027) and 34% (n = 551), respectively. Conclusion The findings show that diabetes nurses across Europe have seen significant increases in both physical and psychological problems in their patient populations during COVID-19.

The diversification of the distribution system in Thailand has created many challenges for farmers, with diversified farm businesses struggling to survive and to ensure profitability across channels. Direct marketing channels at wholesale markets provide farmers the opportunity to develop a new farm business division. Design/methodology/approach The study consists of qualitative and quantitative approaches. First, in-depth interviews with farmers were conducted, and selected case studies were employed to develop a research framework and design the questionnaire. Second, the questionnaire survey was conducted. Using factor analysis and logistic regression, farmers' data were studied to define the factors of success in direct marketing. Findings Three key drivers were examined and verified. The findings indicate that the development of direct marketing channels requires farmers to efficiently allocate family labour, possess negotiation skills and manage a farmer network. Particularly, the presence of negotiation skills coupled with digital technology can enable farmers to expand the market and build their network. Research limitations/implications Two marketing channels have been explored. However, more choices in marketing channels utilizing digital resources should be addressed in future research.

Clinical studies have reported rhythmic fluctuations in allergic diseases. The search for natural and harmless active ingredients based on biological rhythm with which to regulate allergic diseases is essential for the control of food allergy. Methods: In this study, mice were treated at different time points to determine the link between the severity of allergic reactions and the circadian clock genes. The mice were treated with lentinan, either continuously or discontinuously, to assess their clinical symptoms, vascular permeability, immune cells, cytokines, and clock genes. Specifically, rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells were treated with lentinan and the rhythmic changes of cell degranulation were measured. Results: The results in different models showed that the allergic reactions in mice treated at different time points were significantly different and thus related to fluctuations in biological rhythm. Treatment with lentinan was found to reduce the amplitude of changes in the clock genes, such as the activation of Per and Cry proteins in allergic mice, as well as to regulate biological rhythm in cells, inhibit the activation of Th2 cells, and alleviate allergic reactions. Furthermore, lentinan changed the rhythm of degranulation in RBL-2H3 cells. Conclusion: Lentinan was, therefore, determined to successfully alleviate allergic reactions by reducing the amplitude of changes in the body's biological rhythm, inhibiting the activation of Th2 cells, and affecting the immune microenvironment.

Findings As a result, this research revealed that radio patrol, when used in a non-randomised manner, is the most effective policing strategy in reducing the 18 criminal demands studied in the perception of decision makers after data emulation with the PROMETHEE II method. Research limitations/implications As research implications, it can be inferred that the use of multicriteria methods in the modelling of problems in public security area can contribute to the rationalisation of use of the available means in the fight against crime in large cities. This research showed that it is possible to use customised policing strategies to absolute reality. Practical implications The practical impact of this research lies in optimising the resources available to law enforcement agencies in the fight against crime in general. Social implications It can be inferred that by choosing appropriate strategies to combat local crime, there is a direct implication in optimising the resources that the government makes available to police agencies. This optimisation allows pressure reduction under the public budget for more features. The model for choosing more effective strategies contributes to local crimes decrease, increasing the sense of the population security.

The objectives of this article were (1) to investigate medical care and survival in STS and BS patients, and (2) to examine methodological aspects of corresponding analyses based on administrative healthcare data. Methods: We analyzed data from a statutory health insurance located in Saxony, Germany, covering approximately 2 million individuals. We identified incident STS and BS patients in the period 2012-2016 using 4 different case definitions. We examined treatment rates and visits to medical oncologists and medical practices descriptively, and then compared results between case definitions. We investigated survival prospects using a relative survival analysis and estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for risk factors for mortality using Cox regression. Results: Across case definitions, the number of included sarcoma patients (STS: n = 871-1,757; BS: n = 216-689) and applied treatments (STS: 42.2-83.1%; BS: 28.3-77.8%) varied substantially.

A stochastic (Markov Chain) model was used to model the transport of the inhaled dose though the human respiratory system and then integrated into the beta-Poisson dose-response model to estimate workers risks of respiratory and gastrointestinal (GI) infection. The infection risk was computed based on workers exposure to E. coli O157:H7 at 10-50% pathogen ingestion rate and pathogen-indicator ratio (P:I) of 1:10(3) and 1:10(4), while exposure to A. fumigatus was based solely on the average initial exposure dose. The results showed that after 11 hours of exposure, workers engaged in scavenging, waste sorting, and site monitoring were at risk of respiratory and GI infection in the magnitude of 10(-1).

We present Ca K-edge XANES spectra of standard compounds with relevance in soils (e.g. calcite, dolomite, hydroxyapatite, anorthite, clay mineral-adsorbed Ca; Ca oxalate, formate, acetate, citrate, pectate, phytate). Calcium XANES spectra with good signal-to-noise ratios were acquired in fluorescence mode for Ca concentrations between 1 and 10 mg g(-1). Most standard spectra differed markedly among each other, allowing the identification of different Ca species in soils and other environmental samples as well as Ca speciation by linear combination fitting. Calcium XANES spectra obtained for samples from different horizons of twelve temperate forest soils revealed a change from dominating lithogenic Ca to clay mineral-bound and/or organically bound Ca with advancing pedogenesis. O layer Ca was almost exclusively organically bound. With increasing SOM decomposition, shares of oxalate-bound Ca decreased. Oxalate-bound Ca was absent in calcareous, but not in silicate subsoil horizons, which can be explained by microbial decomposition in the former vs. stabilization by association to pedogenic minerals in the latter soils.

Results We identified a basic morphometric landscape as a six-polyp circlet developed around a founder polyp, with established distances between polyps (six equilateral triangles), reflecting a strong genetic-based background vs high plasticity on the population level. Testing these rules in regular and chimeric S. pistillata colonies, we revealed similar morphometric/allometric rules developed via a single astogenic pathway.

Methods and Results: Twenty-four lymphedema therapists were asked to apply MLB to the healthy volunteer's upper limb. The participants consisted of 20 females and 4 males with a mean age of 43.4 (range: 24-62) years. They included licensed massage therapists, nurses, a judo therapist, an occupational therapist, and a medical doctor. Twenty therapists (83.3%) had clinical experience applying MLB. Compression pressure was measured with PicoPress at 5 cm proximal to the wrist, immediately after the application (phase 1) and after exercise (phase 2). The mean MLB pressure was 67.7 +/- 5.0 mmHg in phase 1 and 55.3 +/- 4.1 mmHg in phase 2, which were significantly different (p = 1.2 x 10(-10)).

Since both EG and TA have antioxidant abilities, the near infrared spectra changed after the addition of the chemicals. While detection of the antioxidant abilities of EG by DNA-SWNT hybrids has been previously reported, TA was employed for the first time. The changes in the absorbance caused by the addition of TA were found to saturate at 0.33 mu M TA, although saturation was not observed even at 3.3 mu M with the addition of EG. Oxidation of DNA-SWNT was suppressed by addition of TA or EG. The effects of TA were much greater than those of EG on the absorbance. The photoluminescence did not appear to saturate at 3.3 mu M for either EG or TA. photoluminescence had a larger measurement capacity than NIR absorbance. Interestingly, the photoluminescence change caused by EG was much larger than that of TA at 3.3 mu M, although the antioxidant property of TA was stronger at 0.33 and 0.033 mu M, suggesting that the optical responses were not simple redox reactions. Peak shifts in the absorbance/photoluminescence spectra revealed unique differences according to the chirality of the SWNTs and the types of chemicals used. This suggests that the combination of absorbance/photoluminescence and peak intensity/peak shifts could detect multiple types of chemical information, not only redox reaction.

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Background: Providing students with virtual role-play experiences has the potential to bring counseling role-plays into large undergraduate courses. Objective: The purpose of this study was to trial a virtual reality role-play experience where students played the role of a student counsellor. Method: Seventy-three undergraduate psychology students played the role of a student counsellor interacting with a virtual client in two role-plays, one via desktop and one via head mounted display (HMD). Students provided feedback on their experience. Results: 70% of the students found the experiences very interesting, engaging and immersive, with 82% preferring the HMD mode of presentation. The virtual characters were believable as distressed clients with 96% of students perceiving greater negative than positive emotion expressed by the characters. Most of the students (64%) mood improved from the beginning of the experience to the end, however 14% experienced a decline in mood. The students agreed (95%) that the experiences would be a valuable experience to a psychology course. Conclusion: Our results provide evidence that the virtual role-play experiences are well-liked by students. Teaching Implications: The approach presented in this paper represents a practical method to provide virtual role-play experiences to both on-campus and online undergraduate students.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 8132}
{"label": "NEG", "text": "Purpose The purpose of this paper is to study the factors that caused The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) security regime to be ineffective in saving transnational drug smuggling, including the internalization of non-optimal values and norms of the ASEAN Drug-Free Declaration. Design/methodology/approach This study uses primary data and secondary data. Data analysis and observation are carried out simultaneously, where data are analyzed directly after it is obtained using descriptive analysis. Interactive data analysis is carried out at the initial step by collecting primary and secondary data. Data are analyzed inductively by drawing conclusions from data obtained from general views to specifics. Findings The development of ASEAN has led to the idea of \"ASEAN Way,\" namely, the ASEAN security forum to eliminate the use of force in maintaining relations between member countries through the dissemination of agreed values. Multilateral negotiations refer to the establishment of a negotiation regime at the ASEAN level that emphasizes the interests of ASEAN member countries in determining agreements relating to transnational drug crimes. There are several inhibiting factors in the negotiation process, namely, perception differences between ASEAN countries on the threat of drug smuggling in the Southeast Asia region and the differences of ASEAN leaders' priorities and agenda. Originality/value The originality/authenticity of research is analyzing the factors that affect the ASEAN security system in transnational protection policies by using two models, namely, the international level negotiation model and one at the national level in the form of ratification of ASEAN international relations related to drug smuggling. At present, transnational crimes, especially drug smuggling, appear and pose a threat to national and international security. The object of this research is ASEAN international organizations in cases of transnational drug smuggling.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 8133}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "This paper investigates the application of particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to plan joint trajectories of the space modular reconfigurable satellite (SMRS). SMRS changes its configuration by joint motions to complete various space missions; its movement stability is affected by joints motions because of the dynamic coupling effect in space. To improve the movement stability in reconfiguration progress, this paper establishes the optimization object equation to characterize the movement stability of SMRS in its reconfiguration process. The velocity-level and position-level kinematic models based on the proposed virtual joint coordinate system of SMRS are derived. The virtual joint coordinate system solves the problem of asymmetric joint coordinate system resulted by the asymmetric joint arrangement of SMRS. The six-order and seven-order polynomial curves are chosen to parameterize the joint trajectories and ensure the continuous position, velocity, and acceleration of joint motions. Finally, PSO algorithm is used to optimize the trajectory parameters in two cases. Consistent optimization results in terms of the six-order and seven-order polynomial in both cases prove the PSO algorithm can be effectively used for joint trajectory planning of SMRS.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 8138}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Vocatives are noun phrases that are generally used as calls to attract an addressee's attention or as addresses to maintain contact with her/him. In her 2014 book, Virginia Hill analyzes vocatives as forms of address; they are converted to syntax as nominal functional projections in the form of vocative phrases. Drawing on work by Speas and Tenny (2003) and Moro (2003), she further posits that vocatives merge as arguments of a speech act phrase in the left periphery. This merging site, Hill 2014 and others (e.g., Slocum 2016) argue, is fixed. This is so despite the fact that vocatives may appear in different positions in their host clause. Under this account, pre-vocative elements appear in that location as a result of movement. This paper presents counterevidence to this argument from Arabic. Using naturally occurring data, mainly from Twitter, the paper shows that Arabic vocatives do not merge in a fixed position in the left periphery. Rather, they are parenthetical adjuncts whose relationship with their host clause is minimally constrained. If correct, the analysis serves as an invitation for a closer and more data-driven look at vocatives in other languages, including those in which vocatives have already been explored.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 8140}

DESIGN Longitudinal observational study. SETTING National Alzheimer's Disease Coordinating Center combining data from 39 Alzheimer's disease centers. PARTICIPANTS 8,034 participants with AD dementia. MEASUREMENTS Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating Scale-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), and Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) Total. Probability of exposure to medication (the propensity score, PS) calculated via logistic regression. Medication classes included all antipsychotics (atypical vs conventional), antidepressants (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor [SSRI] vs non-SSRI), and benzodiazepines. Participants treated with a medication class were matched with participants not treated with that class with the closest-matched PS. The effect of medication treatment was assessed using linear mixed-effects models. RESULTS Participants had a mean (SD) age of 75.5 (9.8) years, and mean (SD) scores of MMSE 21.3 (5.7), CDR-SB 5.5 (3.4), and NPI-Q Total 4.5 (4.4). Mean duration of follow-up was 2.9-3.3 years depending on medication class. Non-SSRI antidepressant use was associated with better CDR-SB (2-year difference in change-DIC: -0.38 [-0.61, -0.15], P = .001). Atypical antipsychotic use was associated with greater decline on MMSE (DIC: -0.91 [-1.54, -0.28] P = .005) and CDR-SB scores (DIC: 0.50 [0.14, 0.86], P = .006). Notably, no drug class was associated with better NPI-Q scores.

{"label": "NEG", "text": "We explore a new way of probing scattering of closed strings in AdS(5)xS(5), which we call 'the large p limit'. It consists of studying four-point correlators of single-particle operators in N = 4 SYM at large N and large 't Hooft coupling lambda, by looking at the regime in which the dual KK modes become short massive strings. In this regime the charge of the single-particle operators is order lambda (1/4) and the dual KK modes are in between fields and strings. Starting from SUGRA we compute the large p limit of the correlators by introducing an improved AdS(5)xS(5) Mellin space amplitude, and we show that the correlator is dominated by a saddle point. Our results are consistent with the picture of four geodesics shooting from the boundary of AdS(5)xS(5) towards a common bulk point, where they scatter as if they were in flat space. The Mandelstam invariants are put in correspondence with the Mellin variables and in turn with certain combinations of cross ratios. At the saddle point the dynamics of the correlator is directly related to the bulk Mellin amplitude, which in the process of taking large p becomes the flat space ten-dimensional S-matrix. We thus learn how to embed the full type IIB S-matrix in the AdS(5)xS(5) Mellin amplitude, and how to stratify the latter in a large p expansion. We compute the large p limit of all genus zero data currently available, pointing out additional hidden simplicity of known results. We then show that the genus zero resummation at large p naturally leads to the Gross-Mende phase for the minimal area surface around the bulk point. At one-loop, we first uncover a novel and finite Mellin amplitude, and then we show that the large p limit beautifully asymptotes the gravitational S-matrix.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 8149}
{"label": "NEG", "text": "Background The piriformis muscle is normally involved in piriformis syndrome and can be treated with botulinum neurotoxin using several different injection methods. However, definitive injection guidelines for the muscle have not been reported previously. Aims This study aimed to determine the ideal area for injections based on the intramuscular nerve distribution as obtained using a modified Sihler's staining technique. Materials and Methods A modified Sihler's method was applied to the piriformis muscle in 15 specimens. The intramuscular arborization areas were identified based on two anatomical landmarks: (a) the lateral border of the sacrum bone and (b) the greater trochanter. Results The nerve entry point for both piriformis muscles was found in the area between the lateral border of the sacrum and one-fifth of the distance toward the greater trochanter. The intramuscular nerve distribution for the piriformis muscle had the largest arborization patterns between one-fifth and two-fifths of the distance from the sacrum to the greater trochanter. The piriformis muscle was tendinous from two-fifths of the distance to the greater trochanter. Discussion This study has yielded suggested optimal injection locations for the piriformis muscle relative to external anatomical landmarks. Conclusion Clinicians can use these guidelines to ensure the effectiveness of not only botulinum neurotoxin injections but also other agents such as steroids, anesthetics, and normal saline. These guidelines will also help to avoid adverse outcomes of injection treatments.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 8150}

Perinatal outcomes for women with obesity in US freestanding birth centers need documentation. Methods Pregnancies recorded in the American Association of Birth Centers Perinatal Data Registry were analyzed (n = 4,455) to form 2 groups of primiparous women (n = 964; 1:1 matching of women with normal body mass indices [BMIs] and women with obese BMIs [>30]), using propensity score matching to address the imbalance of potential confounders. Groups were compared on a range of outcomes. Differences between groups were evaluated using chi(2) test for categorical variables and Student's t test for continuous variables. Paired t test and McNemar's test evaluated the differences among the matched pairs. Results The majority of women with obese BMIs experienced uncomplicated perinatal courses and vaginal births. There were no significant differences in antenatal complications, proportion of prolonged pregnancy, prolonged first and second stage labor, rupture of membranes longer than 24 hours, postpartum hemorrhage, or newborn outcomes between women with obese BMIs and normal BMIs. Among all women with intrapartum referrals or transfers (25.3%), the primary indications were prolonged first stage or second stage (55.4%), inadequate pain relief (14.8%), client choice or psychological issue (7.0%), and meconium (5.3%).

We select panel data from the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange from 2002 to 2015. We focus on the two dimensions of innovation input and innovation output and use Poisson regression, negative binomial regression, zero expansion regression, and other methods to examine the effects of the revision of the intangible assets accounting standards on enterprise technology innovation. Our research reveals the following: (1) In general, the revision of the intangible assets accounting standards can promote enterprises' technological innovation activities; (2) This effect is heterogeneous by ownership: before the revision of accounting standards for intangible assets, state-owned enterprises had more innovation input than non-state-owned enterprises, but the innovation output of non-state-owned enterprises has become greater than that of state-owned enterprises even though the policy only significantly improved the innovation output of the latter; and (3) The system lacks a continuous effect. The revision of the intangible assets accounting standards has only a one-year lag effect on the incentive effect of enterprise innovation input activities, mainly because enterprise innovation input has only a one- to two-year lag effect on output.

Methods and Results Prisms with a water/cement ratio of 0 center dot 5 were prepared by blending Portland Pozzolana cement with the requisite volume of a B. megaterium (microbial) solution whose concentration was 1 center dot 0 x 10(7) cells per ml. Mortar prisms of 160 mm x 40 mm x 40 mm were fabricated for this study. Mortars cured for 28 days were exposed to 0 center dot 2465 mol l(-1) Na2SO4 solution using accelerated ion migration test method for 36-h session using a 12V DC power source. Sulphate ion concentration was then determined through the ingressed mortar at 10 mm interval. A minimum water sorption gain of 0 center dot 61% was observed on the prism prepared with and cured in microbial solution. A maximum of 0 center dot 0289 and a minimum of 0 center dot 0093 water sorptivity coefficients were exhibited by the control prism and microbial prisms, respectively. The microbial prisms exhibited the lowest apparent diffusion coefficient (D-app) of 4 center dot 5179 x 10(-11) m(2) s(-1). Conclusions Direct incorporation of B. megaterium in mortar preparation, curing or both regimes significantly retarded water sorption and lowered sulphate ion ingress. The inclusion of this bacterial in the mortar further complements the pozzolana pore structure benefits.

End-tidal PCO2 (PetCO(2)) and transcutaneous PCO2 (PtcCO(2)) are noninvasive alternative methods. Objective To examine the use of PetCO(2) and PtcCO(2) as PaCO2 surrogates in awake children. Methods A prospective observational study. Consecutive awake children in a stable condition referred to the Sleep Unit of Hospital de Pediatria Dr. J. P. Garrahan with suspected or confirmed sleep-related respiratory disorders requiring ABG were included. PetCO(2) and PtcCO(2) were recorded simultaneously during arterial puncture. PetCO(2) and PtCO2 values were compared with PaCO2. Correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman analysis were applied. The sample size was calculated considering a mean difference <= 3 mmHg as clinically acceptable. Results Sixty-eight sample sets were obtained from 67 patients. The median age was 9.11 years (0.23-18.76). During 94.1% of the procedures patients breathed spontaneously, 30% needed multiple punctures and 92% resulted in pain. Median (IQR) PaCO2 (mmHg) was 36.3 (31.45; 40.90), PetCO(2) 33.0 (29; 39) and PtcCO(2) 38.8 (32.95; 43.32). Correlation and agreement for PaCO2/PetCO(2) and PaCO2/PtcCO(2) was r = .6 and .9, and media of bias = 2.83 (-9.97; 15.64) and -1.88 (-9.01; 5.24), respectively. Hypercapnia (PaCO2 > 45.0 mmHg) was present in 8/68 (11.8%) samples. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value to detect hypercapnia with PetCO(2) was 38%, 98%, 75%, and 92%, respectively, and with PtcCO(2), 100%, 90%, 57%, and 100%, respectively. Conclusion PtcCO(2) showed better agreement with PaCO2 than PetCO(2) but because of the wide dispersion of values, neither method can replace the gold standard.

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Post-collisional K-rich magmatic rocks of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau provide important information for understanding the continental collision and uplift of this plateau during the Cenozoic. However, the source of these K-rich rocks is still debated, and limited investigations have been conducted in the western Kunlun Mountains (WKM) in the northwestern margin of the plateau. In this paper, we present geochemical, geochronological, and Sr-Nd-Hf isotope data for Quanshuigou post-collisional K-rich igneous rocks from the WKM. Geochronological results show that these rocks were emplaced during two stages: (1) ca. 5.3 Ma, as an intrusive suite of granite porphyries; and (2) ca. 4.8 Ma, as a suite of shoshonites. These rocks are enriched in light rare earth elements (LREEs) and large-ion lithophile elements (LILEs), and depleted in heavy rare earth elements (HREEs) and high-field-strength elements (HFSEs). Compositions of the granite porphyries classify these rocks as high-K calc-alkaline peraluminous A-type granites. Combining the negative zircon epsilon (Hf)(t) values (-6.9 to -1.1) with Hf crustal model ages (T-DM2) of 1.16-1.53 Ga and negative epsilon (Nd)(t) values (-5.31 to -4.96) with two-stage Nd model ages (T-DM2) of 1.22-1.46 Ga, these signatures suggest that the granite porphyries most probably originated from partial melting of thickened lower crust with limited input of mantle-derived magmas. In contrast, the shoshonites have low SiO2 contents (50.84-53.94 wt.%), relatively high Mg-# values (50-57), and epsilon(Nd) (t) values ranging from -6.18 to -5.34, with single-stage Nd model ages (T-DM1) of 0.97-1.02 Ga. Our analyses show that the parental magma of the shoshonites probably formed by partial melting of EMII-type lithospheric mantle, with the addition of subducted and recycled oceanic sediments. Hence, we conclude that these granite porphyries and shoshonites formed in a post-collisional, extension-related geodynamic setting and that the melting was probably triggered by motion on the Altyn Tagh strike-slip fault system.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 8215}

This study was aimed to assess the ecotoxicity of ciprofloxacin at environmentally relevant concentrations (1 mu g/L, and 1.5 mu g/L) to a cultivable fish Cirrhinus mrigala. Responses of antioxidant enzymes, histological anomalies, and inorganic ion levels were studied. SOD activity in gill, liver, and kidney tissues was elevated in ciprofloxacin-exposed groups when compared with the control group. CAT activity was predominantly decreased in ciprofloxacin treated groups relative to the control group. GST activity in the ciprofloxacin treated groups was increased (except kidney tissues [Treatment I (1 mu g/L)], and gill tissues fifteenth day) significantly (p < .05). The LPO level was elevated in the ciprofloxacin treatment groups throughout the study period (except Treatment II (1.5 mu g/L) tenth day in kidney tissues). A series of histological anomalies were noticed in the gill, liver, and kidney tissues of the ciprofloxacin treated groups. Ciprofloxacin exposure caused a significant decrease of sodium, potassium, and chloride levels in the plasma of C. mrigala. A parallel among an imbalanced oxidative defense system, tissue structural changes, and alterations of plasma inorganic ions could be considered as a reliable biomarker for antibiotic toxicity study.

The first was to obey the laws and customs of my country, adhering firmly to the faith in which, by the grace of God, I had been educated from my childhood and regulating my conduct in every other matter according to the most moderate opinions, and the farthest removed from extremes, which should happen to be adopted in practice with general consent of the most judicious of those among whom I might be living. For as I had from that time begun to hold my own opinions for nought because I wished to subject them all to examination, I was convinced that I could not do better than follow in the meantime the opinions of the most judicious; and although there are some perhaps among the Persians and Chinese as judicious as among ourselves, expediency seemed to dictate that I should regulate my practice conformably to the opinions of those with whom I should have to live; and it appeared to me that, in order to ascertain the real opinions of such, I ought rather to take cognizance of what they practised than of what they said, not only because, in the corruption of our manners, there are few disposed to speak exactly as they believe, but also because very many are not aware of what it is that they really believe; for, as the act of mind by which a thing is believed is different from that by which we know that we believe it, the one act is often found without the other. Also, amid many opinions held in equal repute, I chose always the most moderate, as much for the reason that these are always the most convenient for practice, and probably the best (for all excess is generally vicious), as that, in the event of my falling into error, I might be at less distance from the truth than if, having chosen one of the extremes, it should turn out to be the other which I ought to have adopted. And I placed in the class of extremes especially all promises by which somewhat of our freedom is abridged; not that I disapproved of the laws which, to provide against the instability of men of feeble resolution, when what is sought to be accomplished is some good, permit engagements by vows and contracts binding the parties to persevere in it, or even, for the security of commerce, sanction similar engagements where the purpose sought to be realized is indifferent:  but because I did not find anything on earth which was wholly superior to change, and because, for myself in particular, I hoped gradually to perfect my judgments, and not to suffer them to deteriorate, I would have deemed it a grave sin against good sense, if, for the reason that I approved of something at a particular time, I therefore bound myself to hold it for good at a subsequent time, when perhaps it had ceased to be so, or I had ceased to esteem it such.", "group": "PHIL", "id": 8228}

Therefore, the validity of the videos becomes more important. Inter frame video counterfeiting is the most common type of video spoofing method that is difficult to detect with the naked eye. So far, it has been suggested that some algorithms detect Inter frame counterfeits based on artisanal characteristics, but the accuracy and processing speed of these algorithms remain a challenge. This article proposes Markov based approach to detecting this particular object. First, the unique Markov characteristics in the DCT domain are extended to capture not only the inter-block correlation but also the intra-block association among the block DCT coefficients. after that, supplementary features are built in the DWT domain to distinguish three types of dependencies between the wavelet coefficients across positions, scales, and orientations. After that, we will introduce a video tampering detection method to detect Inter frame video tampering based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models by retraining the accessible CNN model trained on the ImageNet dataset. The proposed method is based on state-of-the-art CNN models, which are retrained to exploit the spatio-temporal relations in a video to strongly detect Inter frame fakes and we have also proposed a confidence score instead of the score of raw output based on these networks, to increase the precision of the proposed method. Through the experiments, the detection precision of the proposed method is 99.16%.

Environmental and physiological factors, such as weather and sleep, have long been suspected to affect brain activity and seizure occurrence but have not been fully explored as prior information for seizure forecasts in a patient-specific analysis. The study aimed to quantify whether sleep, weather, and temporal factors (time of day, day of week, and lunar phase) can provide predictive prior probabilities that may be used to improve seizure forecasts. Methods This study performed post hoc analysis on data from eight patients with a total of 12.2 years of continuous intracranial electroencephalographic recordings (average = 1.5 years, range = 1.0-2.1 years), originally collected in a prospective trial. Patients also had sleep scoring and location-specific weather data. Histograms of future seizure likelihood were generated for each feature. The predictive utility of individual features was measured using a Bayesian approach to combine different features into an overall forecast of seizure likelihood. Performance of different feature combinations was compared using the area under the receiver operating curve. Performance evaluation was pseudoprospective. Results For the eight patients studied, seizures could be predicted above chance accuracy using sleep (five patients), weather (two patients), and temporal features (six patients). Forecasts using combined features performed significantly better than chance in six patients. For four of these patients, combined forecasts outperformed any individual feature. Significance Environmental and physiological data, including sleep, weather, and temporal features, provide significant predictive information on upcoming seizures. Although forecasts did not perform as well as algorithms that use invasive intracranial electroencephalography, the results were significantly above chance. Complementary signal features derived from an individual's historic seizure records may provide useful prior information to augment traditional seizure detection or forecasting algorithms.

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Aim Mountains are biodiversity hotspots and are among the most sensitive ecosystems to ongoing global change being thus of conservation concern. Under this scenario, assessing how biological communities vary over time along elevational gradients and the relative effects of niche-based deterministic processes and stochastic events in structuring assemblages is essential. Here, we examined how the temporal trends of bird communities vary with elevation over a 20 year-period (1999-2018). We also tested for differences in temporal dynamics among habitat types (among-community variability) and functional groups (within-community variability). Taxon 97 species of common breeding birds. Location Swiss Alps. Methods We used abundance data from the Swiss breeding bird survey to compute different temporal dynamic metrics (temporal turnover, synchrony, rate of community change and community-level of covariance among species). We also examined the relative contribution of deterministic and stochastic processes in community assembly using the Raup-Crick method and the normalized stochasticity ratio. Results We found that, with greater elevation, temporal species turnover increased while the rate of overall community change over successive years decreased, suggesting that high-elevation communities display more erratic dynamics with no clear trend. Despite this, we found a more deterministic assembly of alpine communities in comparison to those located at lower elevations. Deterministic processes had greater influence than stochastic processes on community assembly along the entire elevational gradient (80% of communities). Forest communities exhibited higher synchrony in comparison to the remaining habitats likely because they consisted of species with greater functional redundancy, whereas alpine communities were the least stable as a result of their low taxonomic richness ('portfolio' effect). Main conclusions Community-level synchrony was overall positive supporting the idea that compensatory mechanisms are rare in natural biological communities. Our results suggest that rather than competition, the existence of differences in the ecological strategies of species may have a stabilizing effect on bird communities by weakening the concordance of species responses to fluctuations in environmental conditions (i.e. enhanced interspecific temporal asynchrony). This study provides evidence that, although species turnover in metacommunities is frequent, a high temporal turnover does not necessarily imply the overriding importance of stochastic processes.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 8272}

To evaluate the effect of probiotic Bacillus coagulans Unique IS2 on mutans streptococci and lactobacilli levels in saliva and plaque in children. Introduction. Dental caries or tooth decay is because of the demineralization of the tooth enamel leading to the breakdown of the enamel causing cavities to be formed. Demineralization of the tooth happens because of the acid secreted by bacteria like mutans streptococci and lactobacilli. It is now suggested that probiotic usage prevents the overgrowth of these pathogenic microbes, thereby reducing caries activity. Methodology. In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, 48 children with ages ranging from 5 to 15 years were divided into two groups, the probiotic and placebo groups. Chewable tablets with and without probiotic Bacillus coagulans Unique IS2 were administered for two weeks. Stimulated saliva samples and plaque were collected at baseline and at the end of 14 days to measure the pH, mutans streptococci, and lactobacilli count of saliva and plaque using chairside kits. Results. A statistically significant reduction in mutans streptococci and lactobacilli counts of both saliva and plaque samples was observed in the B. coagulans Unique IS2 treated group after 14 days of administration compared to the baseline and placebo group (using paired t-test). Conclusion.

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Marte Meo is a video-based counselling method founded by Maria Aarts in the Netherlands and now in worldwide use (Aarts, Aarts Production, 2008). Marte Meo has been adopted and put into practice by a large and diverse network of trained and certified counsellors across the world. It was invented, developed and spread by a vanguard of practising counsellors who have adapted it to a variety of contexts. This is a classic example of research and theory emerging from and following practice; we first need to synthesise the lessons the practitioners and families have learned. We need to better understand how it is implemented; how it is viewed by its practitioners and recipients; and the extent to which variability in implementation may be an asset or a drawback in the continuing evolution of the programme, and in any eventual attempt to document its effects. Therefore, the present article aimed to address this important and hitherto unexplored research topic of the Marte Meo method in counselling and to describe the current state of use of Marte Meo. How is Marte Meo used and applied in a counselling and therapeutic context? Who uses Marte Meo in professional practice? Which function and which meaning does Marte Meo have in general practice and especially in counselling and therapy? What are typical concerns, goals or areas of application? We report on an ongoing mixed methods research project which began in 2015. This paper focuses on the research methods. We will explain why an integrated exploratory sequential design (Cresswell, 2017) is best suited to our purposes. The exploratory sequential design of the Marte Meo project has five phases: as the first phase, we conducted a systematic literature review, analysing the status of existing research. The staged qualitative research consisted of designing, conducting and analysing semi-structured interviews with parents and Marte Meo counsellors (phase 2), and then using that analysis to inform the design, the conduct and the analysis of videotaped observations of everyday situations in day-care centres to examine the process and effects of Marte Meo interaction elements on children (phase 3). Combining these qualitative analyses then became the basis for the development of an online questionnaire that could enable us to collect quantitative data on the current use of Marte Meo in practice by experts (phase 4). This builds into the fifth phase in the final interpretation. One of the key findings of the qualitative parts is that Marte Meo is perceived as advantageous. The experts reported more joy and success in their work. In particular, in the pedagogical context, the daily, resource-oriented 'Marte Meo view', which was sharpened by the training, seems to be essential, as it enables an awareness of the needs of the interaction partners and the beneficial interaction elements. Moreover, for some interviewees the use of Marte Meo does not seem to be limited to professional practice, but is expressed in a general humanistic attitude towards interpersonal relationships of all kinds. The quantitative survey has confirmed and supplemented these results. On the other hand, we found that Marte Meo is most often used in addition to the systemic approach. A later article will focus more on the findings. This article will conclude with a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the research design-concerning this special research project and concerning counselling research in general.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 8284}

More importantly, the authors find evidence that consumers with moderate levels of degree/betweenness centrality are more susceptible to normative influence and status competition than those with low or high degree/betweenness centrality. The inverse-U patterns in the above relations are consistent with middle-status conformity and anxiety. Research limitations/implications This research complements social influence and new product diffusion research by documenting important contingencies (i.e. network locations) in consumer susceptibility to different types of social influence from a social network perspective. Practical implications The findings will assist marketers to leverage social influence by activating relevant social ties with effective messages in their network marketing strategies. Originality/value This research provides a better understanding of the mechanisms driving susceptibility to social influence in new product diffusion.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 8308}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Background. The Swiss Orthopaedics Minimal Dataset (SOMD) was launched seven years ago. It is a standardized, generic, and patient-reported outcome questionnaire, comprising ten items (location of disease, pain within the past four weeks, limitations at work/leisure/sleep/autonomy, subjective value of a body part, employment status, work disability (sick leave/pension), and household support). We conducted this study about the SOMD to report its reliability, validity, and clinical applicability. Methods. A retrospective observational cohort study was conducted. The test-retest study population (n = 60; lost to follow-up: n = 7 (12%)) was drawn from three retirement homes (in 2013), while the test study population (n = 14,180; excluded (e.g., duplicates): n = 1,990 (14%)) consisted of patients from a university hospital (in 2014-2017). In the test-retest study population, the same questionnaire was completed twice (at days 0 and 7). In the test study population, only the first questionnaire was included (to avoid duplicates). In a subgroup of the test study population (n = 302), only those patients who completed the SOMD and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) of the hip within 14 days were considered (to minimize recall bias). Reliability (test-retest and internal consistency), criterion validity for the item of pain, and return rates were analyzed. Results. The test-retest study population (n = 53) showed very high test-retest reliability for all tested items of the SOMD (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.96-1.00 (95% confidence interval 0.93-1.00), p<0.001). The test study population (n = 12,190) revealed good internal consistency reliability for all ten items (Cronbach's alpha = 0.80). The return rates of the SOMD were improvable (43% in 2016 and 31% in 2017). The subgroup of the test study population (n = 302) displayed a borderline acceptable criterion validity (correlation of the item of pain between SOMD and WOMAC hip: rho = 0.62, p<0.001). Conclusion. This is the first report about the validation of the SOMD. A relatively high reliability (test-retest and internal consistency), borderline acceptable (criterion) validity for the item of pain, and improvable clinical implementation were observed. This analysis serves as the basis for a structured modification of the SOMD to improve its value.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 8312}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Background: Posterior circulation stroke is characterized by poor prognosis because its optimal thrombolysis \"time window\" is always missed. After mechanical thrombectomy (MT), the recanalization rate of posterior circulation obstruction is significantly increased, but prognosis remains poor. To best manage patients, prognostic factors are needed to inform MT triaging after posterior circulation stroke. Methods: A systematic literature search was done for the period through April 2020. Studies included those with posterior circulation stroke cases that underwent MT. The primary outcome measure in this study was the modified Rankin Scale on day 90. Results: No outcome differences were found in gender, atrial fibrillation, smoking, and coronary artery disease (OR = 1.07, 95% CI: 0.90-1.28; OR = 1.02, 95% CI: 0.82-1.26; OR = 1.26, 95% CI: 0.94-1.68; and OR = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.58-1.22, respectively). Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and previous stroke correlated with poorer prognosis (OR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.48-0.77; OR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.50-0.73; and OR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.55-0.99, respectively). However, hyperlipidemia correlated with better prognosis (OR = 1.28, 95% CI: 1.04-1.58). Conclusion: Our analysis indicates that hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or previous stroke correlate with poorer outcomes. Intriguingly, hyperlipidemia correlates with better prognosis. These factors may help inform triage decisions when considering MT for posterior circulation stroke patients. However, large, multicenter, randomized controlled trials are needed to validate these observations. (c) 2020 S. Karger AG, Basel", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 8316}

Again drawing on contemporary Kant commentary, I argue that Kant's moral and practical theories, like his epistemology, can be read in a very different way. Kant's ethical subjects, for instance, can be understood as dependent on their relations with others to become moral and rational at all, and are always embedded in a particular context that provides the content of thought about what to do. Interpretations of Kant's central terms, previously introduced, are reviewed in light of his ethics, further elaborating and differentiating Kant from the familiar 'Kantian' picture in education.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 8320}

One category of financial abuse is consumer fraud or \"scams.\" Evidence suggests that scams are becoming increasingly ubiquitous, yet how scams impact older adults remains under-researched. The purpose of this paper is to report data from 80 older adults' written responses to a Mass Observation Archive Directive, commissioned in autumn 2015, which focused on scams. Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative approach was used with data captured via written responses to a set of questions. There was no limit on the length of written accounts, and respondents remained anonymous. Data were analysed thematically, resulting in four key themes. Findings - The data indicated scams impact individuals in terms of health and well-being, irrespective of whether they have experienced financial loss, and trigger implementation of strategies intended to avoid being defrauded. There was also evidence of scam-related stigma with individuals who are defrauded being subject to derision and censure. Social implications - Individuals who have been victimised by fraudsters may need access to practical and emotional support. This requires the design of appropriate interventions and the stigma associated with being scammed to be addressed. Originality/value - This paper adopts an original approach to collecting rich, candid data about an under-researched topic. The authors highlight that anti-scam interventions should equip individuals to identify and avoid scams without inciting fear or anxiety; proposing this may be facilitated by drawing on health and safety risk assessment protocol when designing anti-scam interventions.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 8322}

(Such seems to me, for instance, the after-effect of Schopenhauer on the most modern Germany: by his unintelligent rage against Hegel, he has succeeded in severing the whole of the last generation of Germans from its connection with German culture, which culture, all things considered, has been an elevation and a divining refinement of the HISTORICAL SENSE, but precisely at this point Schopenhauer himself was poor, irreceptive, and un-German to the extent of ingeniousness.) On the whole, speaking generally, it may just have been the humanness, all-too-humanness of the modern philosophers themselves, in short, their contemptibleness, which has injured most radically the reverence for philosophy and opened the doors to the instinct of the populace.

Objective: To describe and compare parental goals of care (GOC) and clinical course in infants with trisomy 13 and 18. Design: Single center, retrospective (2013-19) analysis of electronic health record repository at a birthing center and a tertiary care hospital. Measurements: ICD-9/10 codes were used to identify patients with trisomy 13 or 18 born between 2013-2019. Their records were abstracted for their diagnosis, hospitalization days, interventions, GOC, death location and length of life. Result: Twenty-eight total patients were identified; trisomy 13, mosaic trisomy 13 and trisomy 18 were diagnosed in 9, 2 and 17 patients respectively. Among the 26 patients with complete trisomy 13 or 18, 8 had life-prolonging and 18 had comfort care goals at birth/diagnosis.

However, the clinical significance of isolated lupus anticoagulant (LAC) positivity is debated. Objectives To investigate the clinical relevance of isolated LAC. Methods A total of 456 patients were enrolled in this study; 66 antiphospholipid syndrome patients and 390 control patients. The control group consisted of autoimmune patients ( n =91), patients with thrombosis but without aPLs ( n =127), and normal controls ( n =172). LAC, anticardiolipin (anti-CL), and anti-beta 2 glycoprotein I (anti-beta 2GPI) immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) were determined according to the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) guidelines. Anti-CL and anti-beta 2GPI were measured by four different solid-phase platforms to overcome variability between test systems. The noncriteria IgA anti-CL and anti-beta 2GPI, antidomain I of beta 2GPI IgG, and antiphosphatidylserine/prothrombin antibodies (anti-PS/PT) IgG and IgM were detected according to the ISTH guidelines for solid-phase assays. Results In total, 70 patients were positive for LAC, of which 44 were negative for both anti-beta 2GPI and anti-CL antibodies. We found that isolated LAC proved to be strongly associated with vascular thrombosis (odds ratio [OR]: 7.3; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.3-16.1), even better than triple-positive samples (OR: 4.3; 95% CI: 1.6-12.2). The titers of the anti-PS/PT IgG and IgM were significantly higher in triple-positivity samples compared with samples with isolated LAC positivity. The majority of single LAC positives were anti-PS/PT-negative. We observed that LAC positivity was weaker in isolated LAC-positive patients compared with LAC activity in triple-positive patients. Conclusion Isolated LAC was highly associated with thrombosis. The presence of anti-PS/PT antibodies could not explain LAC positivity in isolated LAC. Isolated LAC showed a weaker LAC activity compared with triple-positive patients.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 8335}

The conversion factor for a new RF coil developed for ultra high magnetic field MRI systems is used to ensure that regulatory limits on RF energy deposition in tissue, specifically the local 10g-averaged specific absorption rate (SAR(10g)), are not exceeded. MRT can be used to validate this factor by ensuring that MRT-measured SAR values do not exceed those predicted by the system. Methods: A 14-cm diameter high-pass birdcage RF coil was built to image the wrist at 7T. A high spatial and temporal resolution dual-echo gradient echo MRT technique, incorporating quasi-simultaneous RF-induced heating and temperature change measurements using the proton resonance frequency method, was developed. The technique allowed for high-temperature resolution measurements (+/- 0.1 degrees C) to be performed every 20 s over a 4-min heating period, with high spatial resolution (2.56 mm(3) voxel size) and avoiding phase discontinuities arising from severe magnetic susceptibility-induced B-0 inhomogeneities. Magnetic resonance thermometry was performed on a phantom made from polyvinylpyrrolidone to mimic the dielectric properties of muscle tissue at 297.2 MHz. Temperature changes measured with MRT and four fiber optic temperature sensors embedded in the phantom were compared. Electromagnetic simulations of the coil and phantom were developed and validated via comparison of simulated and measured B-1(+) maps in the phantom. The position of maximum SAR within the coil was determined from simulations, and MRT was performed within a wrist-sized piece of meat positioned at that SAR hotspot location. MRT-measured and system-predicted SAR values for the phantom and meat were compared. Results: Temperature change measurements from MRT matched closely to those from the fiber optic temperature sensors. The simulations were validated via close correlation between the simulated and MRT-measured B-1(+) and SAR maps. Using a coil conversion factor of 2 kg(-1), MRT-measured point-SAR values did not exceed the system-predicted SAR(10g) in either the uniform phantom or in the piece of meat mimicking the wrist located at the SAR hotspot location. Conclusions: A highly accurate MRT technique with high spatial and temporal resolution was developed. This technique can be used to ensure that system-predicted SAR values are not exceeded in practice, thereby providing independent validation of SAR levels delivered by a newly built RF wrist coil. The MRT technique is readily generalizable to perform safety evaluations for other RF coils at 7T. (c) 2020 American Association of Physicists in Medicine", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 8339}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "In recent years, hydrogels as an attractive class of intelligent soft materials have been applied in various advanced fields, including electronic materials, wearable devices, and wound dressing materials. However, it still remains a critical challenge to integrate information encryption transmission capability, antibacterial activity, high mechanical performance, adhesiveness, and self-healable ability into one material and achieve the synergistic characteristics through a simple method. In our study, a facile strategy of a plant-inspired hydrogel was proposed, which provides a novel initiator-free photo-cross-linked hydrogel system by simply mixing the coumarin derivative Pho-CA and the monomer in water, and then obtaining the hydrogel Gel-C-Am under the irradiation of UV light without adding any other cross-linking agents and initiators, and this process is very similar to the growth process of plants in nature. This novel hydrogel presents desirable mechanical properties (including twist, stretchability, and recoverability), which exhibits elongation of approximately 1600%. More interestingly, Gel-C-Am hydrogel displays reversible adhesiveness to various substrates (such as glass, paper, leaves, and rubber), and its adhesion properties can be regulated by water: the viscosity disappears when its surface becomes wet, and the viscosity will recover after the water evaporates. In addition, the developed hydrogel has certain self-healable ability. Two pieces of the Gel-C-Am hydrogel can combine together and reshape into one piece in water, and the fused hydrogel has uniform and interconnected pores under SEM. Based on the characteristic of Pho-CA whose fluorescence get recovery after UV irradiation, the hydrogel can be used in the field of encryption and decryption. Also, the resulting Gel-C-Am hydrogel shows an effective antibacterial activity and can potentially be addressed as antibacterial coatings. Taken together, the formation of the novel fluorescent hydrogel system is just like the growth of a plant in the presence of water and light, Pho-CA and the monomer will form a highly stretchable and recoverable self-healing hydrogel with water-controlled adhesiveness. The developed Gel-C-Am hydrogel shows favorable attributes and is suitable for applications in antibacterial polymeric coatings and information encryption transmission.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 8341}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Objective: Mistake in diagnosis Background: Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE), a commonly misdiagnosed and underdiagnosed pathology, presents with altered mental status, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia. WE is most commonly caused by excessive alcohol use, but also has diverse nonalcoholic etiologies. Here we describe 2 cases of nonalcoholic WE with different etiologies that were initially misdiagnosed due to lack of correlation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings with clinical information. Case Reports: Patient A, a 50-year-old woman with recent gastric sleeve surgery, presented with horizontal gaze-evoked nystagmus, ataxia, and altered mental status. MRI fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) revealed isolated bilateral, symmetrical, thalamic hyperintensities, initially diagnosed as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. A review of imaging and clinical presentation provided an alternate diagnosis of nonalcoholic WE secondary to nutritional deficiency. Intravenous (IV) thiamine improved symptoms with resolution of MRI findings 6 months later. Patient B, a 64-year-old woman, presented with nausea, vomiting, dizziness, altered mental status, and weight loss. MRI FLAIR revealed isolated bilateral, symmetrical, thalamic hyperintensities, initially determined to be ischemia, prompting stroke management. A diagnosis of nonalcoholic WE was suggested, given the patient's low thiamine levels and history of malnutrition, and was confirmed by her excellent therapeutic response to IV thiamine. Conclusions: Nonalcoholic WE remains a challenging diagnosis because of the variable clinical presentation, myriad of underlying etiologies, and lack of standardized diagnostic laboratory tests. A multidisciplinary approach with close collaboration between the radiologist and clinical care team is critical to narrow down the differential and initiate correct management.

Developing models driven by temperature (T) and soil water potential (psi) may provide tools for choosing adequate sowing conditions. Models are usually developed with controlled chamber germination data, but they can be built using field emergence and weather station data. Seedling emergence data of four Paspalum populations (two dallisgrass subspecies, bahiagrass and vaseygrass) were gathered from five experiments in three Campos locations (Buenos Aires, Montevideo and Salto) during two years, with fall and spring sowing dates and irrigated and non-irrigated plots. Thermal and hydrothermal time models were used for emergence timing. The predictions were better for irrigated plots and fall sowings. For maximum emergence proportion (MEP), a mixed linear model was adjusted. Within a non-irrigated treatment, the higher MEP was for early-spring sowings, but the lowest for late-spring ones. Additionally, a thermal time index (TTI) was modified to model MEP. A coefficient which weighs degree-days accumulation according to the hydrothermal range (HTR) of each day was set. The HTRs were defined by T and psi thresholds. Thresholds and coefficient values were optimized by genotype until linear regressions between MEP and modified TTI achieved higher fit.

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Who bears responsibility for the actions of a city or state? Is it the entity that we sometimes call a nation? Or the individual members of the nation? Shakespeare's Henry V includes a brief interchange the night before the battle at Agincourt that addresses this question.

Henry V is a play that emphasizes the role of the imagination as central to both stagecraft and the politics of creating a nation.

Methods: The authors conducted a meta-analysis to compare the results of level of evidence I trials comparing CD with and without BMCTs. Results: Overall, 579 procedures were analyzed: 265 in the CD group and 263 in the CD + BMCTs group.

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Background Executive dysregulation and impulsivity can both predispose individuals to risk-prone actions. Although the risk of falls is well established in people with poor executive function, its association to impulsivity is less clear. Purpose To describe and assess the prognostic capabilities of the relationship between impulsivity, executive function, functional capability, and falls in the in-patient neurorehabilitation population. Materials and Methods A prospective cohort study in a 26-bed neurorehabilitation unit in London, recruiting 121 patients, of whom 94 were deemed eligible for inclusion. Cognitive-behavioural assessment was undertaken using the short (16-item) version of the Urgency-Premeditation-Perseverance-Sensation Seeking-Positive Urgency (UPPS) impulsive behaviour scale, and the Trail Making Test (TMT). Patients also underwent a functional assessment at admission and discharge using the UK Functional Independence and Assessment Measure tool (FIM + FAM). The main outcome of interest was falling during an in-patient episode, which are routinely recorded in a computerized registry of adverse incidents. Results Measurements of impulsivity (based on the UPPS-Short form) and executive function (based on the Trail Making Test) were not found to be significantly associated with functional improvement, or risk of falling. Predictive modelling experiments demonstrated that neither of the aforementioned results were capable of identifying individuals at risk of falling more accurately than an informed guess. Conclusion Where impulsivity is present, measurement using structured tools such as the UPPS may be informative to guide individualized rehabilitation programmes; however, its usefulness as the basis of risk prediction models for falls is less likely given the results of this study.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 8392}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Purpose Climate change affects the geographic and seasonal range of malaria incidence, especially, in poor tropical countries. This paper aims to attempt to conceptualize the potential economic repercussions of such effects with its focus on Ethiopia. Design/methodology/approach The paper is conceptual and descriptive in its design. It first reviews existing literature and evidence on the economic burdens of malaria, and the impacts of climate change on malaria disease. It then draws the economic implications of the expected malaria risk under the future climate. This is accompanied by a discussion on a set of methods that can be used to quantify the economic effects of malaria with or without climate change. Findings A review of available evidence shows that climate change is likely to increase the geographic and seasonal range of malaria incidence in Ethiopia. The economic consequences of even a marginal increase in malaria risk will be substantial as one considers the projected impacts of climate change through other channels, the current population exposed to malaria risk and the country's health system, economic structure and level of investment. The potential effects have the potency to require more household and public spending for health, to perpetuate poverty and inequality and to strain agricultural and regional development. Originality/value This paper sheds light on the economic implications of climate change impacts on malaria, particularly, in Agrarian countries laying in the tropics. It illustrates how such impacts will interact with other impact channels of climate change, and thus evolve to influence the macro-economy.

Due to the harsh environment and substantial costs, it is difficult to construct many fulcrum ports along the Russian Arctic coast, which provide support services for ships navigating the NEP. A multi-criteria decision model is hence constructed to select fulcrum ports among candidates to support Arctic shipping through the NEP. Based on the model, the evidential reasoning (ER) approach is used to aggregate quantitative data and qualitative expert judgments to generate distributed assessments for candidate ports, as well as modeling uncertainties such as incompleteness and ignorance in the assessment of candidate ports. Their suitability as fulcrum ports are prioritized according to the utilities. The results show that Pevek, Sabetta, and Murmansk are the ideal fulcrum ports for the eastern, central, and western section, respectively, of the Russian Arctic coast. The associated policy recommendations include prioritizing the improvement of selected fulcrum ports, attaching importance to promising candidate ports, updating outdated infrastructure, and implementing more related projects.

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Home range dynamics and movement are central to a species' ecology and strongly mediate both intra- and interspecific interactions. Numerous methods have been introduced to describe animal home ranges, but most lack predictive ability and cannot capture the effects of dynamic environmental patterns, such as the impacts of air and water flow on movement. Here, we develop a practical, multi-stage approach for statistical inference into the behavioural mechanisms underlying how habitat and dynamic energy landscapes-in this case how airflow increases or decreases the energetic efficiency of flight-shape animal home ranges based around central places. We validated the new approach using simulations, then applied it to a sample of 12 adult golden eagles Aquila chrysaetos tracked with satellite telemetry. The application to golden eagles revealed the effects of habitat variables that align with predicted behavioural ecology. Further, we found that males and females partition their home ranges dynamically based on uplift. Specifically, changes in wind and sun angle drove differential space use between sexes, especially later in the breeding season when energetic demands of growing nestlings require both parents to forage more widely. This method is easily implemented using widely available programming languages and is based on a hierarchical multistate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck space use process that incorporates habitat and energy landscapes. The underlying mathematical properties of the model allow straightforward computation of predicted utilization distributions, permitting estimation of home range size and visualization of space use patterns under varying conditions.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 8399}

This research is aimed at developing nano-emulsions and nano-emulgels as the ultimate potential delivery systems of statins for administration via the transdermal route. Methods Oil-in-water (o/w) nano-formulations (nano-emulsions and nano-emulgels) containing 2% (w/w) of the selected statin and 8% apricot kernel oil as oil phase were formulated. The nano-formulations were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), pH, viscosity, droplet size and zeta-potential. Results Nano-emulsions' and nano-emulgels' droplet size ranged between 114.23-169.83 nm and 149.83-267.53 nm, respectively. The addition of Carbopol (R) Ultrez 20 increased the nano-emulsions' viscosity (3.59-8.38 cP) resulting in the formation of nano-emulgels (viscosity: 1911.00-46,090.00 cP). The entrapment efficiency (90.77-99.55%) confirmed the incorporation of the statins. Membrane release studies indicated that statins were released at higher flux values in nano-emulsions compared to their respective nano-emulgels. Ex vivo (skin diffusion) studies indicated higher median values in the nano-emulgels compared to their nano-emulsion counterparts. Conclusions The results indicate the benefits of nano-emulsions and nano-emulgels as potential alternative delivery systems for the transdermal delivery of statins.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 8408}

In general, the aromatic intermediate products of p-cresol is less toxic compared to p-cresol. All intermediate products degrade to shorter chain of carboxylic acids with further oxidation. The major degradation pathway of p-cresol is benzene ring oxidation through electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction by molecular ozone and hydroxyl radical, and single electron transfer by persulfate radical, evidenced by the presence of methyl group in majority of the detected compounds. Hydroxyl radical also oxidizes p-cresol through hydrogen atom abstraction at methyl group side-chain; evidenced by the detected 4-methylbenzyl alcohol, 4-hydroxy-benzaldehyde, 3,4-dihydroxy-benzaldehyde, and 3,4-dihydroxy-benzoic acid; the simultaneous oxidation pathway in peroxone leads to faster p-cresol degradation as compared to ozonation and ozone-persulfate.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 8413}

The case of curved micro-tubes with doubly-clamped boundary conditions resting on nonlinear elastic foundation is considered. Based on the modified couple stress theory, curved micro-tubes under uniformly distributed transverse pressure and uniform temperature rise are analyzed. It is assumed that the material properties of the curved micro-tube are temperature-dependent and graded across the radius of cross-section. The governing equations of the curved micro-tube are established within the framework of higher-order shear deformation theory and the von Karman kinematic assumptions. These equations are reformulated for the case of curved micro-tubes with even distributed porosities based on the uncoupled thermoelasticity theory. The system of nonlinear differential equations governing the equilibrium position of curved micro-tubes is solved using the two-step perturbation technique. The analytical solutions are given in this study to obtain the large deflection in curved micro-tubes as an explicit function of the thermal/mechanical load.

In this research, 180 common carp (32.26 +/- 1.01 g) were randomly distributed to nine fibreglass tanks. The fish were fed a diet with 200 mg/kg olive leaf extract (group 1), 400 mg/kg olive leaf extract (group 2), and basal food (control group) for 75 days. At the end of the experiment, WG, SGR and PER values were significantly higher in the groups fed the diet containing 200 mg/kg of olive leaf extract compared with the control group. Furthermore, FCR and FER values were improved in the groups fed by diets with various levels of olive leaf extract than the control group. The contents of WBCs, lysozyme and NBT activity were significantly increased in the groups fed diets containing olive leaf extract. Cholesterol content was significantly lower in the group fed diet containing olive leaf extract compared with the control group. Also, serum triglyceride and carcass lipid contents were significantly lower in the group fed diet containing 200 mg/kg of olive leaf extract compared with the control group. Total protein, albumin, globulin and calcium contents were significantly higher in the group fed the diet containing 200 mg/kg of olive leaf extract compared with the control group. Our results demonstrated that diet containing 200 mg/kg olive leaf extract were efficient feed additives and has the potential for use in improving the growth performance and health status for this species.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 8448}

This study aims to understand Plasmodium species distribution and the genetic diversity of msp1 and msp2 of parasite populations using molecular tools. Methods A total of 222 clinical isolates from individuals with uncomplicated malaria were subjected to Plasmodium species identification by nested real-time PCR. 166 isolates positive for Plasmodium falciparum mono infections were further genotyped for msp1 (MAD20, K1, and RO33), and msp2 allelic families (3D7 and FC27). Amplicons were resolved through capillary electrophoresis in the QIAxcel Advanced system. Results Mono-infections were high and with 75% P. falciparum, 14% Plasmodium vivax and 9% P. falciparum/P. vivax co-infections, with less than 1% Plasmodium malariae identified. For msp1, MAD20 was the most prevalent (99%), followed by K1 (46%) allelic family, with no sample testing positive for RO33 (0%). For msp2, 3D7 allelic family was predominant (97%), followed by FC27 (10%). The multiplicity of infection of msp1 and msp2 was 2.6 and 1.1, respectively, and the mean overall multiplicity of infection was 3.7, with the total number of alleles ranging from 1 to 7. Conclusions Given the increasing importance of antimalarial drugs in the region, the genetic diversity of P. falciparum msp1 and msp2 should be regularly monitored with respect to treatment outcomes and/or efficacy studies in regions, where there are ongoing changes in the malaria epidemiology.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 8449}

The aim of this study is to investigate the applicability of the Falys-Prangle-method on burnt human remains. Materials and methods Fifty-two SCE of 40 cremated individuals (out of 86) from the William M. Bass collection of the Forensic Anthropology Center (Knoxville, Tennessee) of known age-at-death and sex are available for assessment. Surface topography, porosity, and osteophyte formation are evaluated, after which the calculated composite score is associated with the corresponding age range as described by Falys and Prangle. The method is also applied on an archaeological case study from Oudenburg, Belgium, dating to the Roman period. Results The assessed age ranges strongly agree with the true age ranges (alpha = 0.828), suggesting the Falys-Prangle-method to be applicable on burnt human remains. The case study from Oudenburg yields markedly improved age-at-death estimates, significantly enhancing our understanding of the age distribution within this community. Discussion Information on age-at-death is key in the construction of biological profiles of past individuals. The mature adult is often invisible in the archaeological record since most macroscopic age estimation methods do not distinguish beyond 46+ years old.

However, Mn(III) disproportionation and Jahn-Teller distortion can induce Mn(II) dissolution and irreversible phase changes, greatly deteriorating the cycling life. Herein, a multi-valence cobalt-doped Mn3O4 (Co-Mn3O4) with high capacity and reversibility, which lies in the multiple roles of the various states of doped cobalt, is reported. The Co2+ doping between the phase change product delta-MnO2 layer acts as a \"structural pillar,\" and the Co4+ in the layer can increase the conductivity of Mn4+ and hold the high specific capacity. More importantly, Co ion (Co2+, Co3+) doping can effectively inhibit the Jahn-Teller effect in discharge products and promote ion diffusion. Using X-ray absorption spectra results and density functional theory modelling, the multiple roles of doped cobalt are verified. Specifically, the Co-Mn3O4 cathode shows high specific capacity of 362 mAh g(-1) and energy density of 463.1 Wh kg(-1) at 100 mA g(-1). After 1100 cycles at 2.0 A g(-1), the capacity retention rate reaches 80%.

Due to the complexity of the boiling heat transfer mechanism, its heat transfer mechanism is still unclear, which limits the further improvement of the cooling efficiency of power electronic equipment. This study aimed to obtain the characteristics of boiling heat transfer in the liquid box of a self-circulating evaporative cooling system and establish an accurate calculation model for boiling heat transfer. To this end, we studied the boiling heat transfer process in a liquid box with a cross-sectional area of 180 mm x 20 mm. The experimental results reveal that bubble flow, Churn flow, and mist flow appear successively in the liquid box with an increase in thermal load. A new correlation for boiling in the liquid box is proposed by introducing a new dimensionless number X-new, and the predicted boiling heat transfer coefficient and experimental data show agreement within 8%. This correlation further improves the calculation accuracy of the boiling heat transfer coefficient and provides a useful reference for engineering applications of the surface-mounted evaporative cooling system.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 8489}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Andinodelphys cochabambensis Marshall & Muizon, 1988 is one of the best preserved metatherian species from the early Palaeocene fauna of Tiupampa (Bolivia). It is represented by five almost complete skulls, three of them being securely associated to sub-complete to partial skeleton. Four skulls could be extracted from a block including several intermingled skeletons. The present paper provides a thorough description of the dental, cranial, and dentary anatomy of A. cochabambensis. The cranial anatomy of A. cochabambensis is similar to that of Pucadelphys andinus. The skull of Andinodelphys however differs from that of Pucadelphys in its larger size and proportionally longer rostrum. Other differences include the presence, in Andinodelphys, of large anteriorly protruding I1s, small palatal vacuities, a transverse canal, and a small hypotympanic sinus. Andinodelphys has the same dental formula as Pucadelphys (I 5/4, C 1/1, P 3/3, M4/4), the plesiomorphic condition for metatherians. Furthermore, both genera share the lack a tympanic process of the alisphenoid, a deep groove for the internal carotid artery at the anterior apex of the promontorium, a small prootic canal perforating the lateral edge of the petrosal and opening laterally in the deep sulcus for the prootic sinus, and a vestigial anterior lamina of the petrosal. Dentally Andinodelphys closely resembles Pucadelphys, the two genera differing in the larger size of the former and in the inconstant presence in the former of a twinned stylar cusp C. Although 25% smaller, the cheek teeth of Andinodelphys closely resemble those of Itaboraidelphys camposi from the early Eocene of Itaborai (Brazil). As far as dental morphology is concerned, both genera are likely to have diverged from a direct common ancestor, probably Andinodelphys-like, with Itaboraidelphys displaying more derived dental structures. Two isolated petrosal from Itaborai (Type 2 petrosals) are morphologically close to those of Andinodelphys but distinctly larger. In this paper, a previous interpretation including the teeth of Itaboraidelphys and these petrosals in the same taxon is followed. A phylogenetic analysis retrieved Itaboraidelphys as a sister taxon of the clade Pucadelphys + Andinodelphys, thus lending support to inclusion of the former in the Pucadelphyidae. Three sets of parsimony analyses were performed. A first set of analyses (with all characters) retrieved a strict consensus tree with a clade as follows: (pucadelphyids, (deltatheroidans (stagodontids, Gurlin Tsav skull-GTS), sparassodonts)). An implied weighting analysis with the same data matrix placed the stagodontids in an early diverging position but retained a clade (pucadelphyids, (deltatheroidans, (GTS, sparassodonts))), the deltatheroidans, being therefore inserted in the pucadelphydans. This result implies an independent arrival of pucadelphyids and sparassodonts to South America, which consequently must have been present in North America in the Late Cretaceous. Possible North American sparassodonts could be the poorly known genera Atokatheridium and Olklatheridium (currently referred to deltatheroidans) and the pucadelphyids may have been present in the Late Cretaceous of North America with the genus Aenigmadelphys. However, this hypothesis is less parsimonious (with regard to palaeobiogeography) than a single southward migration of an ancestral Pucadelphyda (Pucadelphyidae + Sparassodonta). Because the result of this first set of analyses may have been induced by heavily homoplastic dental characters related to hypercarnivory, a second set of analyses was performed excluding all the dental characters. The strict consensus is poorly resolved but retains monophyletic Marsupialia and Sparassodonta. An implied weighting analysis retrieved a monophyletic Pucadelphyda but split the deltatheroidans, the polyphyly of which is regarded as a possible artefact related to the lack of dental characters. The GTS is sister taxon to Pucadelphyda. Because the polyphyly of deltatheroidans contradicts all previous hypotheses, a third set of analyses has been performed excluding only those molar characters that supported the close relationships of the hypercarnivorous clades (deltatheroids, stagodontids, and sparassodonts). The strict consensus tree retrieved monophyletic deltatheroidans, Marsupialia and sparassodonts. An implied weighting analysis resulted in deltatheroidans forming a paraphyletic stem assemblage of Metatheria and monophyletic Pucadelphyda. The GTS was no longer related to sparassodonts but was the sister taxon of a clade including the North American taxa of the data matrix, Asiatherium, and Marsupialia. This topology, which is favoured here, supports (as well as that of the second set of analyses) a single pucadelphydan southward migration, probably in the Late Cretaceous, with a Tiupampian radiation of South American carnivorous metatherians.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 8513}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Background: With the development of positive psychology, several studies show that positive and negative emotions are not always opposing. Understanding how positive and negative emotions correlate and the factors contributing to resilience in stroke survivors requires further research. Objectives: To identify the patterns and correlations of stigma, depression, and posttraumatic growth (PTG) among stroke survivors. Methods: Stroke-related stigma, depression, PTG, and neurological status were evaluated at 1-month and 3 months post-stroke using the Stroke Stigma Scale (SSS), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Chinese version of the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (C-PTGI), modified Rankin Scale (mRS), and Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS). The paired t-test, nonparametric test, and Spearman's correlation test were used to analyze differences and relationships between results at the two time points. Results: At 3 months compared to 1-month post-stroke, we found significant reductions in mRS and stigma scores, and an increase in PTGI scores, while the PHQ-9 scores reduced non-significantly. SSS, PHQ-9, and mRS scores were positively correlated with each other at time1 (all P < .01), and all showed no significant relationships with PTGI scores (all P > .05). Social support scores were negatively correlated with stigma (P < .01), PHQ-9 (P < .01), and PTGI scores (P > .05) at 3 months. Conclusions: Stroke-related stigma is strongly associated with depression while neither of them has significant relationships with PTG during the early stage of survivors' rehabilitation in our study.

Methods In present cohort study, we prospectively explore the association between sleep duration and all-cause mortality among 15,092 participants enrolled in the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS) from 2005 to 2019. Sleep duration and death information was collected by using structured questionnaires. Cox regression model with sleep duration as a time-varying exposure was performed to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The dose-response association between them was explored via a restricted cubic spline function. Results During an average follow-up of 4.51 (standard deviation, SD: 3.62) years, 10,768 participants died during the follow-up period. The mean (SD) age of the participants was 89.26 (11.56) years old. Compared to individuals with moderate sleep duration (7-8 hours), individuals with long sleep duration (> 8 hours) had a significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality (HR: 1.13, 95%CI: 1.09-1.18), but not among individuals with short sleep duration (<= 6 hours) (HR: 1.02, 95%CI: 0.96-1.09).

RESULTS In this study, hard template and hydrolysis synthetic procedures have been compared for the production of nanostructured La-based catalysts. The materials have been characterized by means of various techniques and tested in ethanol conversion as a probe reaction. Both preparation procedures give rise to higher surface areas than those reported for conventional synthesis and the surface properties are different, showing the formation of oxysulfate or of a complex mixture of carbonate and hydroxycarbonate. CONCLUSIONS Lanthanum-based oxide can be efficiently prepared using different synthetic procedures that allow to obtain nanosized La-based mixed oxides. However, great attention should be paid to the preparation step, because the role of impurities markedly affects the stability and the catalytic properties of the prepared oxide. The use of the hard templating procedure allows a reduction of the amount of carbonate upon air exposure, thus stabilizing the starting oxide, by protecting the surface with the presence of lanthanum oxysulfate (La2O2SO4).

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Introduction. Magnetic Resonance Imaging has better resolution for soft tissue; at the same time, the robot can work in a stable manner for a long time. MRI image-guided breast interventional robots have attracted much attention due to their minimally invasive nature and accuracy. In this paper, a hydraulic-driven MRI-compatible breast interventional robot is proposed to perform breast interventional procedure. Methods. First is the analysis of the design requirements of the hydraulic-driven MRI-compatible breast interventional robot, and then the design scheme is determined. Second, the three-dimensional model and the link frames are established. The workspace of the robot end point is solved by MATLAB/Simulink software. Then, the 3D printing technology is used to make a physical model of the MRI-compatible breast interventional robot. After assembly and debugging, the physical model is used for workspace verification, and the simulation result of the workspace shows that it is correct. Finally, the experimental research on the positioning error of the hydraulic drive is carried out, which established the theoretical foundation for the follow-up control research of the robot. Results. The positioning error has nothing to do with the motion distance, speed, and length of the selected tubing. The errors are 0.564 mm, 0.534 mm, and 0.533 mm at different distances of 40 mm, 80 mm, and 120 mm, respectively. The errors are 0.552 mm, 0.564 mm, and 0.559 mm at different speeds of 3 mm/s, 5 mm/s, and 8 mm/s, respectively. The errors are 0.564 mm, 0.568 mm, and 0.548 mm for different lengths of 0.5 m, 1 m, and 1.6 m, respectively. Then, the robot's working space on the XOZ plane and the XOY plane meets the conditions. Conclusion. The structure of a differential rotary breast interventional robot is determined, with the link frames assigned to the mechanism and the Denavit-Hartenberg parameters given. Workspace simulation of MRI-compatible breast interventional robot is done in MATLAB. The 3D printed MRI-compatible breast interventional robot is assembled and debugged to verify that its working space and positioning error meet the requirements.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 8547}
{"label": "NEG", "text": "A thorough theoretical analysis of vacancy effects on syngas combustion was conducted for the chemical looping combustion (CLC) process using NiO as an oxygen carrier (OC). A density functional theory (DFT) analysis was conducted to provide new insights into the effects of surface vacancies on OC behavior such as O migration, syngas adsorption, and syngas oxidation. The results showed that the vacancies are expected to promote the subsequent oxidation reactions, which might come from the lower state energies of the reactants, the syngas adsorption configurations on the defective surface. Furthermore, the proposed reaction mechanisms showed that the presence of the defective sites benefited the syngas oxidation by reducing the energy barriers of the CO and H-2 oxidation reactions. In particular, H-2 oxidation changed from a 3-step process on a perfect surface (i.e., without vacancies) to a 2-step process on a defective surface. Moreover, the CO oxidation reaction was shown to dominate the overall syngas oxidation process. In addition, the outward diffusion direction of oxygen migration was observed from the bulk side to the surface. The proposed CO and H-2 reaction kinetics were validated against the experimental data using a DFT-based mean-field (MF) model. An electronic analysis was also performed to further support the intrinsic effects of surface vacancies obtained from the DFT analysis.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 8548}

However, the effects of NLRP3 inflammasome on periodontitis have not been fully studied. Materials and methods We used ligature-induced periodontitis models of NLRP3 knockout mice (NLRP3(KO)) and their wildtype (WT) littermates to compare their alveolar bone phenotypes. We further used Lysm-Cre/Rosa(nTnG) mouse to trace the changes of Lysm-Cre(+) osteoclast precursors in ligature-induced periodontitis with or without MCC950 treatment. At last, we explored MCC950 as a potential drug for the treatment of periodontitis in vivo and in vitro. Results Here, we showed that the number of osteoclast precursors, osteoclast differentiation and alveolar bone loss were reduced in NLRP3(KO) mice compared with WT littermates, by using ligature-induced periodontitis model. Next, MCC950, a specific inhibitor of the NLRP3 inflammasome, was used to inhibit osteoclast precursors differentiation into osteoclast. Further, we used Lysm-Cre/Rosa(nTnG) mice to demonstrate that MCC950 decreases the number of Lysm-Cre(+) osteoclast precursors in ligature-induced periodontitis. At last, treatment with MCC950 significantly suppressed alveolar bone loss with reduced IL-1 beta activation and osteoclast differentiation in ligature-induced periodontitis.

All measures are captured from over 90 000 individuals. This biocuration effort provides increased access to curated MetS-related data and will serve as a hypothesis-generating tool to aid in novel biomarker discovery. In addition, MetSRR provides the ability to generate and export ethnic group-/race-, sex- and age-specific curated datasets, thus broadening participation in research efforts to identify clinically evaluative MetS biomarkers for disparate populations. Although there are other databases, such as BioM2MetDisease, designed to explore metabolic diseases through analysis of miRNAs and disease phenotypes, MetSRR is the only MetS-specific database designed to explore etiology of MetS across groups, through the biocuration of demographic, biological samples and biometric data.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 8562}

These effects are mediated by instructive cross-talk between MSC and immune and neural cells. Astroglial reaction to injury is a prominent feature of both EAE and MS. Astrocytes constitute a relevant target to control disease onset and progression and, based on their potential to acquire stem cell properties in situ, to foster recovery in the post-acute phase of pathology. We have assessed how MSC impact astrocytes in vitro and ex vivo in EAE. Expression of astroglial factors implicated in EAE pathogenesis was quantified by real-time PCR in astrocytes co-cultured with MSC or isolated from EAE cerebral cortex; astrocyte morphology and expression of activation markers were analyzed by confocal microscopy. The acquisition of neural stem cell properties by astrocytes was evaluated by neurosphere assay. Our study shows that MSC prevented astrogliosis, reduced mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines that sustain immune cell infiltration in EAE, as well as protein expression of endothelin-1, an astrocyte-derived factor that inhibits remyelination and contributes to neurodegeneration and disease progression in MS. Moreover, our data reveal that MSC promoted the acquisition of progenitor traits by astrocytes. These data indicate that MSC attenuate detrimental features of reactive astroglia and, based on the reacquisition of stem cell properties, also suggest that astrocytes may be empowered in their protective and reparative actions by MSC.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 8587}

The patient was a 45-year-old man with a chief complaint of discomfort at the maxillary right central and lateral incisors for one year. Oral examination showed spontaneous pain, swelling, and tooth mobility of the maxillary right central and lateral incisors. Intraoral and panoramic radiographs showed clear apical radiolucency at these sites, although there were no carious incisors. Neither tooth had periodontal pockets, and there was no bleeding on probing sites. A cold thermal examination revealed normal responses of the vital dental pulp. Initial panoramic radiography showed an apical lesion of the maxillary right first premolar, which was root filled and without inflammatory symptoms. A cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) revealed that the apical lesion of the premolar had extensively spread to the anterior through the palatal side, circumventing the palatal side of the adjacent canine, and reached the apical areas of the central and lateral incisors. We treated the apical lesion of the first premolar, and the radiolucent regions had almost disappeared after three years with regard to not only the apical lesion in the first premolar and incisors but also the primary symptoms on the incisors without endodontic treatment.

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Purpose Highways are one of the most critical infrastructure projects with strategic impact on the countries' development. Asphalt has been historically the main pavement material used in all highway projects, especially in Egypt. However, with the booming in concrete technology in the past two decades, concrete has become a strong rival to asphalt, especially in highway applications. Several factors impact the decision-making criteria for any highway, which differ according to the priorities and requirements of each decision-maker and the nature of the project. Design/methodology/approach This research focuses on studying and analyzing the different factors that impact the decision for selecting the material type for highways in Egypt's pavement construction industry. The outputs of the analysis are then incorporated into a multi-decision-making tool to assess the optimum solution as per the priorities of the decision-maker. A holistic framework is developed to compare asphalt and concrete pavements solutions considering; initial cost, maintenance cost on the life cycle, construction duration, embodied energy and fuel consumption. The data collection on local highways was performed through interviewing and surveying experts in the consulting, contracting and building materials fields (total of 15 respondents). Findings A multi-decision-making tool developed using the superiority and inferiority ranking method for selecting the best alternate. To illustrate the practicality of the proposed framework, a case study for assessment and validation has been done on Sokhna-Quarries highway in Egypt. The framework results reveal that despite a lower initial cost and faster construction of asphalt, concrete pavement is more cost-efficient on the lifecycle time. The multi-decision-making model indicates that concrete is a better alternate for highway applications given the cost, time and energy factors considered. Originality/value The proposed model takes into consideration the important parameters in selecting the type of pavement to be constructed considering two alternates asphalt and concrete.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 8603}

Method We use data from multiple panels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation and logistic regressions to examine these relationships. Results We find declines in four of the seven hardships, with little change or moderate increases for the others. Declines were larger for hardships more dependent on longer term income flows, while those more sensitive to short-term income fluctuations declined by less (or increased). Notably, declines in hardship were most evident among the lowest income groups over the period. Conclusion That short-term hardships did not decline suggests that income volatility poses an important challenge for many households. Larger declines in hardship among the lowest income groups suggest a greater underreporting of income over time and the presence of family resources not comprehensively counted in the official poverty measure.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 8619}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "The fire at Grenfell Tower, a block of public housing flats in The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, London, in June 2017 has come to epitomize the growing divide between Britain's rich and poor in the last decade. Yet, the proximity of Kensington Palace, home of many senior British royals, has been almost entirely ignored in scholarship and commentary on the Grenfell Tower atrocity. This is especially remarkable given the philanthropic 'work' the monarchy has undertaken since the fire's aftermath. This paper explores Together: Our Community Cookbook (The Hubb Community Kitchen. 2018. Together: Our community cookbook. London: Ebury Press), a cookbook released by Meghan Markle as part of her royal charitable 'duties', to raise money for The Hubb Community Kitchen - a group of women displaced in the fire, who prepared meals for survivors in the aftermath. The cookbook repeatedly emphasizes unity, collectivity and togetherness: the importance of a local community response to rehabilitate Grenfell survivors. By analysing the cultural politics of Together through radical contextualization, this paper argues that in releasing the cookbook, the British monarchy itself is incorporated into this narrative of community and recovery, which erases the classed and racialised inequalities between the monarchy and Grenfell survivors (and, indeed, those in similar socioeconomic positions). Fundamentally, the cookbook obscures the ongoing culpability of 'the elites' for the sociopolitical and socioeconomic inequalities experienced by citizens in Britain. Together evidences how inequalities in contemporary Britain are normalized and legitimized in the public imaginary through media representations, obscuring the structural inequalities that underpinned the conditions at Grenfell, and instead individualizing the survivors as 'responsiblised' neoliberal subjects.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 8624}

Insects observed in field plots of these flowers were classified into seven easily identifiable groups (bumblebee, honeybee, solitary bee, butterfly/moth, beetle, fly and other) and monitored for 2 years at three sites in the Upper Midwest region of the USA. Average seasonal observations across years and sites varied from 1.6 to 5.3 total insects/min for field pennycress and 1.4 to 4.5 insects/min for winter camelina. Lowest visitation rates occurred in central Iowa and highest rates in south-eastern Minnesota for both crops. Multiple regressions showed that visitation rates for specific insect groups were correlated poorly but significantly (p < .10) with select variables. For example, in field pennycress, visitation by combined bumblebees and honeybees (Apidae) increased with greater air temperature at sampling time and annual site precipitation, whereas fly (Diptera) visitation was related to sampling date and flower cover. Similarly, in winter camelina, solitary bees were linked to increasing air temperature at sampling time and annual site precipitation, whereas flies were correlated with wind speed and flower cover at sampling. Field pennycress and winter camelina are reliably attractive to beneficial pollinating insects across a wide geographic region, but visitation rates and proportional representation of various insect groups depended on a range of site and weather characteristics.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 8627}

The paper investigates migrants' satisfaction with working conditions on cocoa farms in Ghana and the key drivers of satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach The study employed a five-point Likert scale to evaluate migrants' satisfaction with remuneration, working hours, welfare, health and safety, contract and freedom. Using primary data from 400 migrants and non-migrants in four cocoa districts, multivariate probit regression was employed to evaluate the determinants of satisfaction with working conditions. Findings Migrant labourers are generally satisfied with their working hours, nature of contract and freedom they enjoy. However, they are unsatisfied with their remuneration, welfare and health/safety conditions on cocoa farms. All things being equal, secondary occupation, nature of contract, number of farmers served by labourer, annual earnings, farm ownership, education and expectations before migration influence migrants' satisfaction with working conditions. Practical implications To improve satisfaction with working conditions and productivity, migrants on cocoa farms should be given protective working gear, long-term or renewable contracts and they should be encouraged to engage in secondary occupations. Originality/value Unlike previous studies that focussed on working conditions in the formal sector, this study explores migrants' satisfaction with working conditions in the informal agricultural sector.

{"label": "NEG", "text": "This article addresses how shared forms of leadership can activate resilient organizing to cope with catastrophic events by examining the case of the 33 Chilean miners' rescue who survived confinement at 600 m below ground for 69 days. Qualitative analysis of interview and document data reveals how the miners as a group engaged in the sharing of agency vis-a-vis the task of absorbing strain and anxiety, thus enabling a sophisticated work capacity and a constructive relational dynamic. The miners' resilient capabilities emerged from the activation of collective resources in three distinct yet complementary modes of interaction: self-organization, collaboration, and mutual caring. Our empirical findings indicate that the distribution of agency becomes essential for the promotion of both collective sensemaking and emotional containment in contexts of crisis. By accounting for such affective-relational underpinning of the sharing of leadership, this article contributes a more nuanced understanding of crisis management and the organization of positive, constructive responses to adversity, breakdown, and conflict.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 8645}

Methods Patients with COVID-19 were classified into four groups according to symptom. The study traced the onset and duration of symptoms, compared laboratory examinations and conducted bioinformatic analysis. Immune indices were further analysed. Results By March 16, 25 patients with COVID-19 and 13 with suspect COVID-19 were admitted to West China Hospital, Sichuan University. Digestive system symptom group had the highest level of ESR (mm/h, P < .0001), serum ferritin (ng/ml, P < .0001), hepatic enzymes (P < .05) and retentive lymphocyte count/percentage (P < .05) and its subsets (P < .05). Combined group (respiratory combined with subsequent digestive system symptom) had the highest level of IL-6 (pg/ml, P = .0046), CRP (mg/L, P = .0004) and moderate lymphocyte depletion. Respiratory system symptom and asymptomatic groups suffered the most from lymphocyte depletion (P < .05). Bioinformatic analysis indicated co-expression of binding related proteins of SARS-COV-2 (ACE2, TMPRSS2 and Furin) in small intestine. CD147 was extensively expressed in alimentary tract. CTSL, PIKfyve, TPC2 and CTSB could be detected with >= moderate expressions in a variety of organs including alimentary system.

Methods: We conducted a multi-site 4-arm pilot randomized controlled trial of a 3-month intervention (TrueNTH Community of Wellness). Eligibility included self-reported prostate cancer diagnosis, having a personal device that connected to the internet, age =18 years, and ability to read English and receive text messages and emails. Men receiving chemotherapy or radiation, or those who reported contraindications to exercise, could participate with physician clearance. Participants were randomized (1:1:1:1) to additive intervention levels: website; website and personalized diet and exercise prescription; website, personalized prescription, Fitbit, and text messages; and website, personalized prescription, Fitbit, text messages, and 2 30-minute phone calls-one with an exercise trainer and one with a registered dietician. Primary outcomes were feasibility (accrual and attrition) and acceptability (survey data and website use). We described self-reported diet and exercise behavior at the time of enrollment, 3 months, and 6 months as secondary outcomes. Results: In total, 202 men consented and were randomized between August 2017 and September 2018 (level 1: 49, level 2: 51, level 3: 50, level 4: 52). A total of 160 men completed the onboarding process and were exposed to their randomly assigned intervention (38, 38, 42, and 42 in levels 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively). The follow-up rate was 82.7% (167/202) at 3 months and 77.2% (156/202) at 6 months. Participants had a median age of 70 years and were primarily White and college educated. Website visit frequency over the 3-month intervention period increased across levels (median: 2, 9, 11, and 16 visits for levels 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively). Most were satisfied or very satisfied with the intervention (20/39, 51%; 27/42, 64%; 23/44, 52%; and 27/42, 64% for levels 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively). The percentage of men who reported being very satisfied was highest among level 4 participants (10/42, 24% vs 4/39, 10%; 5/42, 12%; and 5/44, 11% for levels 1, 2, and 3, respectively).

Initially, castor oil was transesterified with methanol or n-butanol to quantitatively yield castor fatty acid alkyl esters. Acetylation of hydroxyl function with acetic anhydride led to the formation of estolide. The unsaturation was epoxidized, resulting in a bifunctional epoxy fatty acid alkyl ester estolide. The bioplasticizers were compounded with PVC and were evaluated for their functionality and compared with commercial phthalate plasticizer diisononyl phthalate (DINP) and nonphthalate 1,2-cyclohexanoic acid diisononyl ester (DINCH). The bioplasticizers showed excellent gelation, efficiency, and compatibility, as well as plastisol viscosity and thermal properties, comparable to or better than the plastisols prepared with commercial controls DINP and DINCH. The volatility of the methyl ester was inferior to the butyl ester. Both compounds showed low water resistance properties.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and risk factors associated with soil-transmitted helminths among school-going children in Lurambi Subcounty, Kakamega, Kenya. Method. A cross-sectional study was conducted from Jan 2020 to Feb 2020 among 392 randomly selected primary school-going children aged 5 to 14 years old in six primary schools. Risk factors associated with STH infection were obtained using a structured questionnaire answered by the children's caregivers. Stool samples were examined using the standard quantitative Kato-Katz technique. The data was analyzed using SPSS version 20 and Epi Info version 7.2.3.1. Result. A total of 278 children provided stool samples for analysis. The overall prevalence of intestinal helminths was 14.4% (40/278). The prevalence of Ascaris lumbricoides was 11.5% (32/278), 0.4% (1/278) for hookworm, 0.4% (1/278) for Trichuris trichiura, and 2.1% (6/278) for Schistosoma mansoni; coinfection was detected in 0.4% (1/278).

Mycobacterium neoaurum is a rapidly growing nontuberculosis mycobacterium (NTM) that was first isolated from soil in 1972 and is ubiquitous in soil, water, and dust. The first reported case of human infection by M. neoaurum was published in 1988, presenting as a Hickman catheter-related bacteremia in a patient with ovarian cancer. M. neoaurum has since been recognized as a source of predominantly opportunistic bloodstream infections in immunocompromised hosts. We report the case of an adult diabetic male with M. neoaurum bloodstream infection secondary to an infected venous-access port that had been implanted nearly six years prior for temporary chemotherapy. Case Presentation. A 66-year-old male with schizophrenia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and a history of excision and chemotherapy to treat adenocarcinoma of the colon 6 years prior, presented with fever and behavioral changes. He was found to have a M. neoaurum bloodstream infection secondary to his implanted subclavian port. Multiple preoperative blood cultures, as well as the removed catheter tip culture, were positive for M. neoaurum. The patient's condition improved to near premorbid levels after port removal and 6 weeks of targeted antimicrobial therapy. Discussion and Conclusions. Bloodstream infections due to rapidly growing NTM, such as M. neoaurum, have been infrequently reported; however, improved isolation and identification techniques based on genomic testing are resulting in a more in-depth recognition of these widely scattered environmental microbes in human infections. Nonetheless, lengthy identification and susceptibility processes remain a diagnostic and treatment barrier. Patients such as ours who have a history of malignancy and an indwelling foreign body have most often been reported as acquiring M. neoaurum bacteremia. Fortunately, device removal and appropriate antimicrobial therapy guided by susceptibility data is often enough to manage these atypical mycobacterial infections.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 8672}

However, little is known about how those within this demographic who receive these interventions perceive the experience. This study aimed to understand the experiences of individuals with dementia or caring for someone with dementia, before and after a 12-week relational counselling intervention delivered through a third sector organisation within England. Semi-structured interviews were completed with participants (29 pre-intervention and 25 post-intervention). Framework analysis was conducted, with four main themes identified; expectations and outcomes of counselling, emotional impact of life with dementia, appraisals of identity and importance of therapeutic relationship. Participants reported that counselling interventions addressed a range of needs and concerns that they had, enabling them to reassess and reconsider these. Specific training is needed before therapists deliver therapeutic interventions with people with dementia, to ensure that appropriate support is provided for those with more severe cognitive impairment or who may have fluctuating capacity.

Here, we report the adsorption of Lewisites (L-1, L-2, and L-3), on graphdiyne nanoflake (GDY) using density functional theory (DFT) omega B97XD/6-31+G (d,p) method. Our results show that Lewisite molecules are preferably physiosorbed at the triangular portion of GDY nanoflake. In particular, the binding of L-3 (3-chlorovinyl arsine) on GDY nanoflake is thermodynamically favorable than L-1 (1-chlorovinylarsonous dichloride) and L-2 (2-chlorovinylarsonous chloride). Symmetry adopted perturbation theory (SAPT0) analysis reveals that the least contribution of repulsive exchange component is present in case of L-2@GDY complex. Further, the smallest HOMO-LUMO energy gap, appreciable charge transfer (NBO), and largest red shift in ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrum are also in accord with the higher %sensitivity of graphdiyne toward L-2. Quantum theory of atom in molecule (QTAIM) analysis is performed to get insight into the noncovalent interactions. Therefore, it is predicted that the sensitivity of GDY nanoflake is potentially high for Lewisite especially for L-2.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 8681}

Objective: To assess changes in PA and ABR at consecutive annual visits in individuals with severe hemophilia A and B (HA/HB) on prophylactic treatment with rFVIIIFc/rFIXFc versus rFVIII/rFIX. Patients/Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review of 344 people with severe HA/HB (ages 6-35) receiving prophylaxis with rFVIIIFc/rFIXFc (EHL factors) or rFVIII/rFIX (conventional factors) for >= 6 months in 2014-2015. Differences in changes in outcomes from 2014 to 2015 were compared across the treatment groups. Results: Baseline characteristics and adherence to the prophylactic regimen were similar across the treatment groups. Greater increase in weekly PA frequency and duration were observed among all EHL groups, except for children treated with rFIXFc. The increase in PA frequency was greater among the children on rFVIIIFc group, adults on rFVIIIFc group, and adults on rFIXFc group by 1.2, 1.2, and 1.4 events/week, respectively, compared to their rFVIII/rFIX counterparts. The increases in PA duration were 44, 60, and 80 min/wk greater among the children on rFVIIIFc, adults on rFVIIIFc, and adults on rFIXFc groups, respectively. Larger reductions in total ABR were observed in children and adults treated with rFVIIIFc compared to rFVIII (0.4 and 0.7 fewer bleeds). Larger reductions were also observed in spontaneous ABR in adult rFVIIIFc and rFIXFc groups (0.8 and 0.3 fewer bleeds, respectively). Conclusions:This study suggests that rFVIIIFc/FIXFc agents can positively impact PA while maintaining low ABRs.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 8693}

Based on the assessment of genetic-environment association, we found that adaptive divergence of the P. stenoptera populations were mainly shaped by solar radiation during fruit development, temperature seasonality, annual temperature, precipitation, and air humidity. In particular, our genome-wide scanning identified a total of 801 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are highly correlated with diverse environmental factors. Further functional annotation of the SNPs identified some candidate genes that are involved into temperature, water, and light adaptation.

Descriptive and inferential statistics, factorial analysis and a logit model were applied. Findings Our results showed that most of the respondents believe citizens have low participation on NHS' financial decisions, confirming the lack of public involvement. Health professionals are more likely to agree with limits on NHS spending, which could indicate potential inefficiencies.

In the context of gender power relations, the literatureoften employs the concept of de-familialisation, which is the degreeto which a woman is able to maintain an autonomous householdwithout having to depend on a male breadwinner. Scholars arguethat current welfare reforms deliberately aim at re-establishing thefamily as the primary source of economic security and encouragea traditional model of gender relations where women have to bedepended on male breadwinners. By reinstating the nuclear familyas the primary source of economic security and a comprehensivealternative to the welfare state, women's ability for agency andresistance becomes narrower and heavily limited by their inferiorgender and class positions.

Methods: CAB cytotoxicity was determined by WST-1 assay. To assess the relationship between CAB efficacy and TLR4 signaling pathways, RT-PCR, western blot and immunofluorescence analysis were performed. Additionally, CAB-mediated apoptotic cell death was assessed by Annexin V and RT-PCR analysis. Results: Our results demonstrated that CAB exerted considerably cytotoxic and apoptotic effects on PC-3 mCRPC cells (p < 0.05). CAB treatment altered TLR4 expression level in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, 1 nM CAB treatment significantly induced NF-kappa B activity through p65 nuclear localization and increased the expression level of caspase-3, Bax and p53. Interestingly, total apoptotic cell death and IRF3 protein levels were increased at 5 nM concentration of CAB despite a decrease in the levels of both NF-kappa B and pro-apoptotic genes. Conclusions: Therefore, NF-kappa B activity may be a potential target for the efficacy of CAB in mCRPC cells.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 8725}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "BACKGROUND: Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs) are amongst the most anxiety-provoking competency assessment methods. An online serious game (OSCEGame) was developed and implemented within the OSCE curriculum. This study aimed to evaluate the usefulness of this serious game on preparedness and reducing OSCE-related stress. METHODS: A serious game was designed to help dental students train for OSCEs. Two game courses (4 stations each) were designed according to year of undergraduate training (4(th) and 5(th) year), based on 6 pre-existing multi-competency OSCE stations. The OSCEGame was available online on a learning platform 4 to 6 weeks before the summative OSCEs. Game use was evaluated by analysing connection data. Preparedness, stress and time management skills were assessed using a questionnaire following the summative OCSEs. The results of 4(th)-year students (OSCE naive population) were compared to those of 5(th)-year students to assess usefulness and benefits of such preparation method. RESULTS: In total, 97% and 60% of the students in 4(th) year and 5(th) year, respectively, used the game. The game was seen as an essential preparation tool to reduce anxiety (for 60% of all students) and increase time management skills (65% of all students). However, significant differences were observed between 4(th-) and 5(th)-year students (anxiety reduction: 65% vs. 22%, p < 0.001; time management skills: 59% vs. 41%, p < 0.05) suggesting that it is most useful for OSCE naive students.

The primary outcome was waitlist removal because of death or clinical deterioration. Continuous and categorical variables were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis and chi-square tests, respectively. Fine and Gray competing-risks regression was used to estimate the subdistribution hazard ratios (HRs) for risk factors associated with delisting. Of 131,839 patients listed for LT, 61.2% were covered by private insurance, 22.9% by Medicare, and 15.9% by Medicaid. The 1-year cumulative incidence of delisting was 9.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.3%-9.8%) for patients with private insurance, 10.7% (95% CI, 9.9%-11.6%) for Medicare, and 10.7% (95% CI, 9.8%-11.6%) for Medicaid.

Additional predictors of delisting included Black race and Hispanic ethnicity, whereas college education and employment were associated with a decreased hazard of delisting. In this study, LT candidates with Medicare or Medicaid had a 20% increased risk of delisting because of death or clinical deterioration compared with those with private insurance.

Treatment algorithms have been attempted as parallel to the increasing experience with COVID-19. In the pathogenesis of this virus pro-inflammatory cytokine storm has been called to have the main role. The right timing should be made for treatments. We proposed IL- 1 blocking by anakinra in seventeen COVID-19 patients at high risk of worsening. Patients were assessed according to HScore, SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score = SOFA), MuLBSTA Score (multilobular infiltration, hypo-lymphocytosis, bacterial coinfection, smoking history, hyper-tension, and age), Brescia-COVID respiratory severity scale (BCRSS). In our study, the mortality rate was 17.6%. Consequently, 1 (5.9%) patient was receiving low-flow oxygen supply, 3 (17.6%) patients needed no longer oxygen supply and 10 (58.8%) patients were discharged from the hospital. According to the results of our study in the manner of general evaluation; we found that SOFA, MuLBSTA, and BCRSS scores were one step ahead according to HScore being insufficient to determine early phases of the disease. In our opinion, the prominent factors that emphasize the use of anakinra could be listed as comorbidity, risk, or presence of secondary infection, ongoing malignant disease. However, the other factors that enhance the use of anakinra in the situation of viremia also could be sorted as no response to full dose antivirals, antiviral side effects, or no success to antiviral treatment.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 8755}

Objectives We compared gait variability at different walking velocities between and within groups of patients with Parkinson-variant multiple system atrophy, idiopathic Parkinson's disease, and a control group of older adults. Methods Gait metrics were recorded in 11 multiple system atrophy, 12 Parkinson's disease patients, and 18 controls using sensor-based gait analysis. Gait variability was analyzed for stride, swing and stance time, stride length and gait velocity. Values were compared between and within the groups at self-paced comfortable, fast and slow walking speed. Results Multiple system atrophy patients displayed higher gait variability except for stride time at all velocities compared with controls, while Parkinson's patients did not. Compared with Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy patients displayed higher variability of swing time, stride length and gait velocity at comfortable speed and at slow speed for swing and stance time, stride length and gait velocity (all P < 0.05). Stride time variability was significantly higher in slow compared to comfortable walking in patients with multiple system atrophy (P = 0.014). Variability parameters significantly correlated with the postural instability/gait difficulty subscore in both disease groups. Conversely, significant correlations between variability parameters and MDS-UPDRS III score was observed only for multiple system atrophy patients. Conclusion This analysis suggests that gait variability parameters reflect the major axial impairment and postural instability displayed by multiple system atrophy patients compared with Parkinson's disease patients and controls.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 8782}

{"label": "NEG", "text": "Background and Aims Reports of moderate to severe liver injury associated with tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor antagonist, have been reported in the post-marketing setting. This case series aims to characterize cases of tocilizumab-associated clinically significant hepatic injury. Methods We analysed cases of severe acute liver injury associated with tocilizumab reported in the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System and the medical literature. Results We identified 12 cases in which tocilizumab was a suspected primary cause of liver injury and eight cases in which serious sequelae of underlying or coincident viral hepatitis were temporally associated with its use. Using the Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) severity scale, five of 12 cases were Grade 5 (two liver transplants, three deaths), one was Grade 4 (liver failure) and six were Grade 3 (serious events with elevated bilirubin). Two cases reported liver atrophy with low hepatocellular expression of Ki-67, a marker of cellular proliferation. Among the eight cases of tocilizumab-associated viral hepatitis exacerbation, three were scored as DILIN severity Grade 5 (one liver transplant, two deaths), one was Grade 4 (liver failure), and four were Grade 3. The reported viral hepatitis events were hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation (n = 3), hepatitis C virus (HCV) flare (n = 1), cytomegalovirus (CMV)-induced liver failure (n = 1), Epstein-Barr virus hepatitis (n = 1), acute hepatitis E (HEV, n = 1) and HEV-induced macrophage activation syndrome (n = 1). Conclusion Tocilizumab may be a primary cause of severe liver injury, as well as exacerbate underlying viral hepatitis. The disruption by tocilizumab of IL-6-mediated immune protection and hepatocyte regeneration may aggravate clinical outcomes in some cases.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 8804}

Design/methodology/approach The authors used a panel of 2,538 public companies listed with the New York Stock Exchange to explain the impact of corporate governance deviance on firm's performance. The authors relied on unique governance variables extracted from the Bloomberg database to develop the governance deviance index. Findings Study unveils that deviance from governance practices influences firm's performance. Consequently, it can be said that the firms which use innovative governance mechanisms, usually stay ahead of the market by leading the governance trends. The findings also generalise the firm's entrepreneurial identity and organisational ecology perspectives. Research limitations/implications Research implies that the firm's entrepreneurial identity demands innovative managerial control. This study is focused on the US financial market, but in future, researchers could revalidate the deviance index. Scholars can also use mixed methods to test the need for innovative governance mechanisms in emerging markets. Practical implications The firms should focus on innovative governance practices not only to safeguard the firm's entrepreneurial identity but also to pursue the growth objectives. Such innovative mechanisms and managerial controls are helpful to deal with industrial transformations to satisfy key stakeholders. Originality/value The study contributed to governance and management control research by sharing insights and catering the potential endogeneity problem faced to measure corporate governance measures. The study also proposes an alternative testing tool to measure governance deviance to add methodological uniqueness and reduce knowledge gap.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 8816}

An analysis of survey data collected in Roma communities in four Central and Eastern European countries lends support to the explanation. The analysis reveals a strong negative correlation between the influence of the Roma community on an individual member's life and the importance accorded by the individual to formal schooling for children. The correlation is robust to controlling for standard determinants of attitudes towards schooling, such as poverty, unemployment, labor market discrimination, and parents' educational attainment.

Methods We used a retrospective, longitudinal study design. Our study sample consisted of rural hospitals between 2011 and 2017. Inpatient volume was measured as inpatient average daily census (ADC). Additional measured hospital characteristics included census region, Medicare payment type, ownership type, number of beds, local competition, total margin, and whether the hospital was located in a Medicaid expansion state. Measured characteristics of the local patient population included total population size, percent of population aged 65 years or older, and percent of population in poverty. To identify predictors of inpatient volume trends, we fit a linear multiple regression model using generalized estimating equations. Findings Rural hospitals experienced an average change in ADC of -13% between 2011 and 2017. We found that hospital characteristics (eg, census region, Medicare payment type, ownership type, total margin, whether the hospital was located in a Medicaid expansion state) and patient population characteristics (eg, percent of population in poverty) were significant predictors of inpatient volume trends.

However, the identity of specific food-derived chemical cues that alter lifespan remains unclear. Here, we identified several volatile attractants that decreased the longevity on food deprivation, a dietary restriction regimen in Caenorhabditis elegans. In particular, we found that the odor of diacetyl decreased the activity of DAF-16/FOXO, a life-extending transcription factor acting downstream of insulin/IGF-1 signaling. We then demonstrated that the odor of lactic acid bacteria, which produce diacetyl, reduced the nuclear accumulation of DAF-16/FOXO. Unexpectedly, we showed that the odor of diacetyl decreased longevity independently of two established diacetyl receptors, ODR-10 and SRI-14, in sensory neurons. Thus, diacetyl, a food-derived odorant, may shorten food deprivation-induced longevity via decreasing the activity of DAF-16/FOXO through binding to unidentified receptors.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 8829}
{"label": "NEG", "text": "Flumorph is a carboxylic acid amide (CAA) fungicide with high activity against oomycetes. However, evolution to CAAs from low resistance to high resistance has never been reported. This study investigated the basis of resistance evolution of flumorph in Phytophthora sojae. Total of 120 P. sojae isolates were collected and their sensitivity to flumorph was evaluated. Although no spontaneous resistance was found among the field isolates, adaptation on flumorph-amended media resulted in the selection of five stable mutant types exhibiting varying degrees of resistance to CAAs. Type I, which exhibited the lowest resistance level, was obtained when the wild-type isolate was exposed to a low concentration of flumorph, but no resistant mutants were obtained by direct exposure to higher concentrations. However, the more resistant types (Type II, III, IV and V) were obtained when Type I were exposed to higher concentrations of flumorph. Similar results were obtained when the entire screening process was repeated, which implied that evolution of resistance to flumorph in P. sojae could be a two-step process, where high resistance phenotypes could develop gradually from low resistance ones. Further investigation into molecular mechanism strongly confirmed that evolution of isolates highly resistant to flumorph occurs in a stepwise process with Type I as intermediary, through accumulation of mutations in their target protein of CAAs (CesA3). Together, our findings indicate that application of low rates of flumorph in field could result in selection of low resistance Type I isolates, but that raising dosage to maintain comparable levels of control could elicit rapid evolution of more resistant Type II, III, IV and V isolates with stepwise accumulation of mutations in CesA3, which would render flumorph ineffective as a control method. Precautionary resistance management strategy should be implemented. The phenomenon described in the study could have broader biological significance.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 8830}

Considering the fact and contributing to the United Nations sustainable development goals of 2019, organizations started focusing their green HRM practices to develop employees' green attitudes and behaviors. This study is an attempt in this direction. It examines the impact of ethical leadership on individuals' green in-role and extra-role behaviors with the mediating role of green HRM practices and the moderating role of individual green values. Design/methodology/approach The study collected data from 645 MBA executive students working in various manufacturing industries with at least one year of experience. The data were collected using a questionnaire-based survey in two-time lags. Findings Hypothesized relationships are tested through structural equation modeling. Findings reflected a significant impact of ethical leadership on green HRM practices, in-role, and extra-role green behaviors. Besides, green HRM practices mediated the relationship between ethical leadership and both types of green behaviors. Furthermore, it was observed that the individual green values strengthened the association between green HRM practices and both types of green behaviors. Research limitations/implications A cross-sectional design with time lags was used to avoid common method bias. The findings of the study contribute to supply-value-fit theory and validate the scale of individual green value. Practical implications This study guides management that employees only perceive their organizational practices as green when they find their leaders are ethical. Further, considering individual green values in the recruitment process can help organizations accomplishing their green goals. Originality/value This study is novel in examining the mediating role of green HRM practices between ethical leadership and green behaviors. Further, the analysis not only validates the scale of individual green values but also noted its moderating role between green HRM and green behaviors.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 8844}

The objective of this study is to assess the association between pathological tumor response following CROSS neoadjuvant CRT and long-term overall survival (OS) in a nationwide cohort. Material and methods All patients diagnosed in the Netherlands with potentially curable esophageal cancer between 2009 and 2017, and treated with neoadjuvant CRT followed by esophagectomy were included. Through record linkage with the nationwide Dutch Pathology Registry (PALGA), pathological data were obtained. The primary outcome was pathological tumor response based on ypTNM, classified into pathological complete response (ypT0N0) and incomplete responders (ypT0N+, ypT+N0, and ypT+N+). Multivariable logistic and Cox regression models were used to identify predictors of pathological complete response (pCR) and survival. Results A total of 4946 patients were included. Overall, 24% achieved pCR, with 19% in adenocarcinoma and 42% in squamous cell carcinoma. Patients with pCR had a better estimated 5-year OS compared to incomplete responders (62% vs. 38%, p< .001). Of the patients with incomplete response, ypT+N+ patients (32% of total population) had the lowest estimated 5-year OS rate, followed by ypT0N+ and ypT+ N0 (22%, 47%, and 49%, respectively, p< .001). Adenocarcinoma, well to moderate differentiation, cT3-4, cN+, signet ring cell differentiation and lymph node yield (>= 15) were associated with lower likelihood of pCR. Conclusion In this population-based study, pathological tumor response based on the ypTNM-stage was associated with different prognostic subgroups. A quarter of patients achieved ypT0N0 with favorable long-term survival, while one-third had an ypT+N+ response with very poor survival. The association between pathological tumor response and long-term survival could help in more accurate assessments of individual prognosis and treatment decisions.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 8868}

Background At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we created a same-day discharge (SDD) pathway after conscious sedation, transfemoral (minimalist) TAVR to help minimize risk of viral transmission and conserve hospital resources. Studies support that next-day discharge (NDD) for carefully selected patients following minimalist TAVR is safe and feasible. There is a paucity of data regarding the safety of SDD after TAVR. Methods In-hospital and 30 day outcomes of consecutive patients meeting pre-specified criteria for SDD after minimalist TAVR at our institution between March and July of 2020 were reviewed. Outcomes were compared to a NDD cohort from July 2018 through July 2020 that would have met SDD criteria. Primary endpoints were mortality, delayed pacemaker placement, stroke and cardiovascular readmission at 30 days. Results Twenty nine patients were discharged via the SDD pathway after TAVR. 128 prior NDD patients were identified who met all criteria for SDD. The STS scores were similar between the two groups (SDD 2.6% +/- 1.5 vs. NDD 2.3% +/- 1.2). There were no deaths at 30 days in either group. There was no significant difference in delayed pacemaker placement (SDD 0% vs. NDD 0.8%, p > .99) or cardiovascular readmission (SDD 0% vs. NDD 5.5%, p = .35) at 30 days.

Biological weed control is an efficient and environmentally friendly technique, usually constitutes naturally derived compounds, including bioherbicidal metabolites produced by Streptomyces sp. The isolation and structural identification of phytotoxic compounds from Streptomyces have recently been proposed as an effective way to the discovery of novel bioherbicides. In the screening of bioherbicidal agents, isolated Streptomyces strain KRA17-580 demonstrated significant phytotoxic activity against Digitaria ciliaris. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA sequence indicated that isolated KRA17-580 is similar to Streptomyces olivochromogenes. The bacterial culture conditions were optimized for temperature, agitation, and initial pH. Streptomyces strain KRA17-580 showed intense phytotoxic activity and high cell mass at an initial pH of 5.5-7.0, more than 150 rpm, and 25-30 degrees C. The herbicidal compounds isolated from the culture filtrate of strain KRA17-580 were purified by solvent partition, C-18, Sephadex LH20 column chromatography, and high-performance liquid chromatography. By 1D-NMR, 2D-NMR, and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis, the 580-H1 and 580-H2 compounds were identified as a cinnoline-4-carboxamide (MW, 173.0490; C9H7N3O2) and cinnoline-4-carboxylic acid (M-W, 174.0503; C9H6N2O2), respectively. Only these two herbicidal compounds showed strong phytotoxic activity against D. ciliaris in foliar applications. However, compound 580-H2 was more phytotoxic than 580-H1 and the toxicity was dose-dependent. The herbicidal metabolite KRA17-580 produced by Streptomyces sp. is a new bioherbicidal candidate that may provide a new lead molecule for more efficient phytotoxic compounds.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 8893}

Ecological thresholds of drivers that cause these shifts in ecosystem state are needed to manage eutrophication symptoms before tipping points are crossed. This study quantifies total nitrogen (TN) load thresholds for abrupt changes in ecologically important seagrass habitat and the appearance of nuisance macroalgae as a function of estimated catchment TN load to shallow, intertidal estuaries in New Zealand. Results indicate that the extents of both macrophyte types are strongly governed by increasing TN load to the estuaries, while total suspended sediment load was not significant alone or as an interaction term. Seagrass extent was unpredictable below a critical TN load envelope (< 50 mg N m(-2) d(-1)), likely because there are additional factors than TN that influence seagrass cover, but once surpassed, seagrass became restricted to less than 10% of intertidal area or absent. Conversely, nuisance macroalgae was predominantly absent unless TN load exceeded 41.15 +/- 21.1 mg N m(-2) d(-1), expanding in extent by 2.7% of intertidal area for every 50 mg N m(-2) d(-1) increase above threshold levels.

However, it remains unclear if the structured nature of such meditation programs is required to effectively manage tinnitus. This study investigated if at-home meditation, guided with a free smart device application, could serve as an alternative to structured, in-person programs. Methods: We monitored self-reported tinnitus severity and other comorbid disorders in 15 participants reporting bothersome tinnitus over an 8-week period. Subjects were asked to meditate for 30 m/d, 5d/w, for 8 consecutive weeks. Questionnaires were administered at baseline, and after 3 weeks, and 8 weeks of at-home meditation. Results: Outcomes indicated at-home meditation practice yielded significant reductions in THI scores after 3 weeks, and significant reductions in THI and TFI scores after 8 weeks. HADS-D scores were significantly reduced after 8 weeks of at-home meditation, but HADS-A scores showed no significant change throughout the study. MAAS scores were significantly enhanced after 3 weeks of at-home meditation practice, and further enhanced at the 8-week time point. Conclusion: At-home meditation could serve as an acceptable alternative to in-person meditation programs to manage tinnitus.

An evolutionary analytical approach is outlined, which is used to study Veracruz's (Mexico) sugarcane cluster through a qualitative methodology. Our goal is to show that social innovation is key to promoting the sustainable development of clusters characterized by fragmented social, power, and innovation networks. Accordingly, innovations in the realm of industrial ecology often have a dual impact. On the one hand, in the dominant network, industrial ecology is reduced to its technological dimensions within a political-economic framework constrained by its external insertion and the maintenance of power dynamics. On the other hand, industrial ecology is a vehicle for a kind of Schumpeterian entrepreneurship driven by the core values of trust, transparency, acknowledgement of other people's capabilities, and non-discrimination. This new transformative network promotes true socio-technical change by enhancing local resources and involving other intermediate actors. It also creates a localized agro-food system that promotes the development of cluster-based dynamics in the territory through radical innovations in industrial ecology.

The principle of virtual work is utilized to obtain the integral form of the Lagrangian equation of motion whose discretized form is solved using the iterative methods which gives the thermal and transformational deformation gradient tensors. Next, the elastic deformation gradient tensor and the first Piola-Kirchhoff stress are calculated and substituted in the GL equation which gives the phase order parameter. The weighted residual method is used to derive the corresponding finite element form which allows for the phase-dependent surface energy BCs. Explicit and different implicit methods belonging to the generalized trapezoidal family are used for time discretization of the GL equation. Various examples of phase transformations are simulated and discussed. The effect of different time integration schemes are also investigated.

This study is aimed at understanding how practicing the use of public transportation can affect the self-efficacy and perceptions of occupational enablement among patients with physical disabilities in a recovery rehabilitation hospital. Method. We recruited 21 inpatients with physical disabilities caused by stroke or orthopedic diseases from a recovery rehabilitation hospital in Japan and used a multimethod design including an intervention study and a follow-up survey. The intervention study utilized a before-after trial and provided hands-on training in the use of public transportation as the intervention. How self-efficacy and perceptions of occupational enablement changed before and after the intervention was measured using the visual analog scale (VAS). The follow-up survey was conducted to investigate whether patients used public transportation postdischarge. Results. Only differences in the VAS scores regarding self-efficacy were significant between before and after the hands-on training in the use of public transportation, whereas differences regarding the perceptions of occupation enablement were not. Self-efficacy after the intervention was higher than that before the intervention. In the follow-up survey, both VAS scores of the psychological factors were significantly higher in the group that used public transportation postdischarge than in the group that did not. Conclusion. Providing hands-on training in the use of public transportation for inpatients with physical disabilities increased their self-efficacy, indicating that psychological factors should be evaluated to predict their occupational skill improvement and to verify the outcomes of an occupational therapeutic intervention.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 8935}

Methods. Using the Sanger sequencing methods, the FGFR4 p.Gly388Arg variant was bidirectionally sequenced in 49 patients with non-RB1 gene mutation in retinoblastoma patients and 13 healthy first-degree relatives and 146 individuals matched by sex and age in the control group. Results. In Turkish population-specific study, the FGFR4 p.Gly388Arg variant was found in 27 (55.1 percent) of 49 patients; mutation was found in 7 (53.8 percent) of these patients' 13 healthy relatives screened. When FGFR4 p.Gly388Arg mutation status is evaluated in terms of 146 healthy controls, in 70 (47.9 percent) individuals, mutation was observed. Our analysis showed that the FGFR4 p.Gly388Arg allele frequency, which according to different databases is seen as 30 percent in the general population, is 50 percent common in the Turkish population. Conclusions. In patients with advanced retinoblastoma who were diagnosed with retinoblastoma prior to 24 months, the FGFR4 p.Gly388Arg allele was found to be significantly higher.

Here we report on the identification of specific E. festucae genes that control host infection. Deletion of setB, which encodes a homologue of the H3K36 histone methyltransferase Set2/KMT3, reduced histone H3K36 trimethylation and led to severe defects in colony growth and hyphal development. The E. festucae Delta clrD mutant, which lacks the gene encoding the homologue of the H3K9 methyltransferase KMT1, displays similar developmental defects. Both mutants are completely defective in their ability to infect L. perenne. Alleles that complement the culture and plant phenotypes of both mutants also complement the histone methylation defects. Co-inoculation of either Delta setB or Delta clrD with the wild-type strain enables these mutants to colonize the host. However, successful colonization by the mutants resulted in death or stunting of the host plant. Transcriptome analysis at the early infection stage identified four fungal candidate genes, three of which encode small-secreted proteins, that are differentially regulated in these mutants compared to wild type.

The knowledge about the transpiration rate of potatoes stored or being transported at different environmental conditions is necessary for predicting the weight of stock after a given period of time. In this study, models incorporating the effect of two most influential yet easily measurable parameters; temperature and humidity on transpiration rate were developed using well-known Arrhenius equation. Since standard Arrhenius equation considers the effect of only temperature, we have employed Modified Arrhenius equations which incorporate the effect of both temperature and humidity. The experimental weight versus time data generated by storing the potatoes at different environmental conditions was used to develop these models with Root Mean Square Error of 0.13-0.32 g/kg day. These models predicted the weight of potatoes stored at different environmental conditions belonging to different potato varieties with Mean Absolute Percentage Error of 0.13-5.5. The study also presents a detailed analysis of transpiration models already available in the literature and compares them with the current model. The models developed in this study will help in making real-time decisions to avoid food wastage in the supply chain. Practical applications It is well established that weight loss occuring due to transpiration leads to degradation of potato quality. During the movement in the supply chain, potatoes may experience varying environmental conditions which influence their rate of transpiration. The knowledge about the transpiration rate of potatoes stored or being transported is necessary for predicting the weight of stock after a given period. This can further aid in decisions regarding the sale and repurposing of the stock to minimize the wastage of potatoes. In addition to this, the knowledge about the transpiration rate is important for designing Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP) where the water vapor transmission rate of the packaging material is influenced by the transpiration rate.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 9005}

Currently, the maximal safe surgical resection, followed by high-dose radiotherapy (RT), is a standard treatment for glioblastoma.

In both simulated BBB and orthotopic murine GL261 glioblastoma models, D-iGSNPs are proved to have a beneficial effect on the BBB penetration and tumor targeting. Meanwhile, data from cell and animal experiments reveal that D-iGSNPs are able to sensitize RT. More importantly, the synergy of D-iGSNPs with low-dose RT can exhibit an almost equal therapeutic effect with that of high-dose RT.

Using cultured MB cancer stem cells and xenograft tumors generated in mice, we show that low expression of miR-326 and its host gene beta-arrestin1 (ARRB1) promotes tumor growth enhancing the E2F1 pro-survival function. Our models revealed that miR-326 and ARRB1 are controlled by a bivalent domain, since the H3K27me3 repressive mark is found at their regulatory region together with the activation-associated H3K4me3 mark. High levels of EZH2, a feature of MB, are responsible for the presence of H3K27me3. Ectopic expression of miR-326 and ARRB1 provides hints into how their low levels regulate E2F1 activity. MiR-326 targets E2F1 mRNA, thereby reducing its protein levels; ARRB1, triggering E2F1 acetylation, reverses its function into pro-apoptotic activity. Similar to miR-326 and ARRB1 overexpression, we also show that EZH2 inhibition restores miR-326/ARRB1 expression, limiting E2F1 pro-proliferative activity.

The objective of the study was to document the pattern of dermatoses among underwater workers in a tropical seaside area. Methods A population-based cross-sectional study of 1 year from April 2015 among people regularly involved in underwater occupation, especially the collection of mollusks. Results Among 62 participants analyzed, the commonly noted dermatoses were scars of previous injuries, sea urchin prick reaction, onychomycosis, tinea versicolor, dermatophytosis, warts, and intertrigo. These workers stabilize their position under water by fixing elbows and knees to rocks, where they get accidentally pricked by sea urchins attached to the rocks. Hands also get pricked by sea urchins while trying to pluck mollusks from rocks, thus leading to the predominance of lesions in elbows, knees, and hands. Conclusion Documenting the pattern of dermatological diseases in any group of underwater workers has not been done previously. Along with doing that, the study also brought to light the existence of a rare disease, sea urchin prick reaction, in notable proportions among an underprivileged group. This study also detected a previously unrecorded clinical finding of a peculiar distribution pattern of lesions over the body in patients with sea urchin prick reaction.

{"label": "NEG", "text": "A concentrated treatment used on the residual pollution layer in the Obennaus and its improved models is inappropriate for establishing the propagation model of an arc along the pollution layer surface. Therefore, discretising the residual pollution layer is innovatively proposed. The residual pollution layer is discretised into several infinitesimal pollution layer elements with various characteristics along the vertical direction from the arc root to the ground electrode. Quantitative relationships between the surface conductivity of a pollution layer element and several variables, including salt deposit density, water film thickness, temperature, and time, are concluded based on experimental data and relevant theories. A distribution factor that determines leakage current densities in a pollution layer is defined. A residual pollution layer surface resistance model based on the discretisation, relational expressions, and distribution factor is established. A comparison of the proposed model with the results observed in the experiments with and without a partial arc shows that the proposed model is reasonable.", "group": "ABSTRACT", "id": 9027}

{"label": "POS", "text": "The Crown Prince\u2019s role in the events of 1914 is often ignored, but young Wilhelm\u2019s popularity with the most prominent figures in the armed forces unsettled his father. The Foreign Minister\u2019s off-the-cuff remark to Albert Ballin, that the Kaiser would only get in the way if he came back from his holiday, showed how many of his ministers had come to disdain Wilhelm\u2019s ability to talk war only when there was no chance of it actually happening. Wilhelm, for all his aggressive syntax, was regarded as a de facto pacifist by those who knew him. In contrast, the Crown Prince, despite being married to the half-Russian Cecilia of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, was well liked with those who controlled the country\u2019s military. Von Tirpitz believed that the Crown Prince \u2018sees things really clearly\u2019, while young Wilhelm belittled his father\u2019s advisers as \u2018weak, spineless fellows, always trying to save the emperor from unpleasantness and difficult decisions\u2019.14 With war clouds gathering and the Kaiser\u2019s mood increasingly unstable as he tried desperately to cling on to his hope of peace among the monarchies and continued economic growth for Germany, he felt threatened by his son\u2019s closeness to some of the most powerful men in the empire.", "group": "HIST", "id": 9030}
