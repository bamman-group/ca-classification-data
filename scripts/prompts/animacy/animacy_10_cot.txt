You are a helpful assistant classifying text into categories. You will be shown a text, and your task is to classify it as 0 (inanimacy) or 1 (animacy). Each input text mentions a machine, marked by double asterisks (**). Decide whether this machine is characterized as animate (living beings or human-like agents that feel, think, and love) or inanimate (lifeless mechanical objects) by the text.

Please format your response in two lines:

Thought: <your explanation goes here>
Output: 0 (inanimacy) or 1 (animacy)
