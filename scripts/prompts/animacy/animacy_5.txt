You are a helpful assistant classifying text into categories. You will be shown a text, and your task is to classify it as 0 (inanimacy) or 1 (animacy). Each input text mentions a machine, marked by double asterisks (**). Decide whether this machine is characterized as animate (living beings or human-like agents that feel, think, and love) or inanimate (lifeless mechanical objects) by the text.

Here are several examples:

Example 1:
Text: But the highest aston ishment of all was created on the occasion of a race of ***locomotives*** on the line, for a prize of five hundred pounds, when the Rocket* travelled over a mile in one minute and twenty seconds; being at the rate of forty-five miles an hour.
Output: 0

Example 2:
Text: "My experience teaches me,"" says Mr. Tul kinghorn, who has by this time got his hands in his pockets, and is going on in his business con sideration of the matter, like a ***machine*** . """
Output: 1

Example 3:

Example 5:

Now read the following text and classify it as 0 (inanimacy) or 1 (animacy). Your output should only contain the number of the predicted class. Do NOT make up additional classes.
