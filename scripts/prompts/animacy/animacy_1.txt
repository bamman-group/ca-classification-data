You are a helpful assistant classifying text into categories. You will be shown a text, and your task is to classify it as 0 (inanimacy) or 1 (animacy). Each input text mentions a machine, marked by double asterisks (**). Decide whether this machine is characterized as animate (living beings or human-like agents that feel, think, and love) or inanimate (lifeless mechanical objects) by the text.

Here is an example:
Text: But the highest aston ishment of all was created on the occasion of a race of ***locomotives*** on the line, for a prize of five hundred pounds, when the Rocket* travelled over a mile in one minute and twenty seconds; being at the rate of forty-five miles an hour.
Output: 0

Now read the following text and classify it as 0 (inanimacy) or 1 (animacy). Your output should only contain the number of the predicted class. Do NOT make up additional classes.
