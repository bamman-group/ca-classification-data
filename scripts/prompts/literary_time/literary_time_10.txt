Text: “This the way to Fernly Park, mister?” asked the stranger in a hoarse voice.  I looked at him. He was wearing a hat pulled down over his eyes, and his coat collar turned up. I could see little or nothing of his face, but he seemed a young fellow. The voice was rough and uneducated.  “These are the lodge gates here,” I said.  “Thank you, mister.” He paused, and then added, quite unnecessarily, “I’m a stranger in these parts, you see.”  He went on, passing through the gates as I turned to look after him.  The odd thing was that his voice reminded me of someone’s voice that I knew, but whose it was I could not think.  Ten minutes later I was at home once more. Caroline was full of curiosity to know why I had returned so early. I had to make up a slightly fictitious account of the evening in order to satisfy her, and I had an uneasy feeling that she saw through the transparent device.  At ten o’clock I rose, yawned, and suggested bed. Caroline acquiesced.  It was Friday night, and on Friday night I wind the clocks. I did it as usual, whilst Caroline satisfied herself that the servants had locked up the kitchen properly.  It was a quarter past ten as we went up the stairs. I had just reached the top when the telephone rang in the hall below.

Text: He then assured them, that since indulgence had only encouraged intrusion, he would for the future be severe;  vere; and concluded with declaring, that the first man who should disturb him with a repetition of such ridiculous apprehensions, or should attempt to disturb the peace of the castle by circulating these idle notions, should be rigorously punished, and banished his dominions. They shrunk back at this reproof, and were silent. "Bring a torch," said the marquis, "and shew me to the dungeon. I will once more condescend to confute you." They obeyed, and descended with the marquis, who, arriving at the dungeon, instantly threw open the door, and discovered to the astonished eyes of his attendants Ferdinand! He started with surprize at the entrance of his father thus attended. The marquis darting upon him a severe look, which he perfectly comprehended "Now," cried he, turning to his people, "what do you see? My son, whom I myself placed here, and whose voice, which  answered to your calls, you have transformed into unknown sounds. "Speak, Ferdinand, and confirm what I say." Ferdinand did so. "What dreadful spectre appeared to you last night? Resumed the marquis, looking stedfastly upon him: gratify these fellows with a description of it, for they cannot exist without something of the marvelous." "None my lord," replied Ferdinand, who too well understood the manner of the marquis. "Tis well," cried the marquis, "and this is the last time," turning to his attendants, "that your folly shall be treated with so much lenity."

Text: 174 THE LAST DAYS OF POMPEII. which, by corridors at the right and left, gave access to these seats, at either end of the oval arena, were also the entrances for the combatants. Strong palings at these passages prevented any unwelcome eccentricity in the movements of the beasts, and confined them to their appointed prey. Around the parapet which was raised above the arena, and from which the seats gradually rose, were gladiatorial inscriptions, and paintings wrought in fresco, typical of the entertainments for which the place was designed. Throughout the whole building wound invisible pipes, from which, as the day advanced, cooling and fragrant showers were to be sprinkled over the spectators. The officers of the amphitheatre were still employed in the task of fixing the vast awning (or velaria) which covered the whole, and which luxurious invention the Campanians arrogated to themselves : it was woven of the whitest Apulian wool, and variegated with broad stripes of crimson. Owing either to some inexperience on the part of the workmen, or to some defect in the machinery, the awning, however, was not arranged that day so happily as usual: indeed, from the immense space of the circumference, the task was always one of great difficulty and art; so much so, that it could seldom be adventured in rough or windy weather 15ut the present day was so remarkably still that there seemed to the spectators no excuse for the awkwardness of the artificers; and when a large gap in the back of the awning was still visible, from the obstinate refusal of one part of the velaria to ally itself with the rest, the murmurs of discontent were loud and general.

Text: I think I see what you mean, said Isabel.  "Where's the letter you told me he had written me?" her husband demanded.  "I haven't the least idea; I haven't asked him."  "You stopped it on the way," said Osmond.  Isabel slowly got up; standing there in her white cloak, which covered her to her feet, she might have represented the angel of disdain, first cousin to that of pity. "Oh, Gilbert, for a man who was so fine--!" she exclaimed in a long murmur.  "I was never so fine as you. You've done everything you wanted. You've got him out of the way without appearing to do so, and you've placed me in the position in which you wished to see me--that of a man who has tried to marry his daughter to a lord, but has grotesquely failed."  "Pansy doesn't care for him. She's very glad he's gone," Isabel said.  "That has nothing to do with the matter."  "And he doesn't care for Pansy."  "That won't do; you told me he did. I don't know why you wanted this particular satisfaction," Osmond continued; "you might have taken some other. It doesn't seem to me that I've been presumptuous--that I have taken too much for granted. I've been very modest about it, very quiet. The idea didn't originate with me. He began to show that he liked her before I ever thought of it. I left it all to you."

Text: CHAPTER XXVII   In the little room they used as parlour-kitchen and which to one of the inhabitants at least was lovely, Fairfax found Molly sitting by the window through which the spring light fell. The evening was warm. Molly wore a print dress, and in her bodice he saw that she had thrust a spray of pink geranium from the window-boxes that Antony had made and filled for her. Nothing that had claim to beauty failed to touch his senses, and he saw the charm of the picture in the pale spring light. He had softly turned the door-handle, and as there was a hand-organ playing without and Molly listening to the music, he entered without her hearing him.  "Is it yourself?" she exclaimed, startled. "You're home early, Tony."  He told her that he had come to take her for a little walk, and as she moved out of the light and came toward him, he thought he knew what Rainsford had meant. She was thin and yet not thin. The roundness had gone from her cheeks, and there was a mild sadness in her eyes.

Who else did they visit as well as Hlubi’s outfit ?—  He was stiffly dignified with his red socks sagging over the boots, his hand feeling masturbatorily round his back and chest under the pullover.  He had taken pictures; Colonel van Staden himself led the raid, that meant they were after something big; the intrepid news photographer had doubled up the fire escape and there was one shot of van Staden’s man, that lout Claasens——He’s holding some chap by the scruff of the neck like a dog, you can see he’s got him by a handful of jacket and shirt—man, his feet are practically lifted dangling off the ground—  —But what was happening? Resisting arrest ?—  —No—no—Claasens is searching him, with the other hand he’s in his pockets—you’ll see... But you won’t because my bloody editor won’t publish. He says to me, they’ll be down on us like a load of bricks. You’ll be in for it too.—You’re not allowed to show the police busy in any situation like that. Prejudicial to the dignity of the law. Their dignity. Christ.—  —Did Claasens see you’d caught him ?—  —I ran like hell. One of the others spotted me but when he came after he slipped on the metal steps, down on his backside, the bugger was lucky he didn’t fall four flights—  The baby on his grandmother’s lap shouted back gleefully at our laughter.

Text: Carlyle disappeared. Barbara had taken off her own warm night-gown then, and put it upon William in place of his cold one--had struck a light and was busily dressing herself.  "Just feel his night-gown Archibald! Wilson--"  A shrill cry of awful terror interrupted the words, and Mr. Carlyle made one bound out again. Barbara followed; the least she thought was that Wilson had dropped the baby in the hall.  That was not the catastrophe. Wilson, with the baby and Lucy, had already disappeared up the staircase, and Madame Vine was disappearing. Archibald lay on the soft carpet of the corridor, where madame had stood; for Joyce, in the act of taking him, had let him slip to the ground--let him fall from sheer terror. She held on to the balustrades, her face ghastly, her mouth open, her eyes fixed in horror--altogether an object to look upon. Archie gathered himself on his sturdy legs, and stood staring.  "Why, Joyce! What is the matter with you?" cried Mr. Carlyle. "You look as if you had seen a spectre."  "Oh, master!" she wailed, "I have seen one."  "Are you all going deranged together?" retorted he, wondering what had come to the house. "Seen a spectre, Joyce?"  Joyce fell on her knees, as if unable to support herself, and crossed her shaking hands upon her chest. Had she seen ten spectres she could not have betrayed more dire distress. She was a sensible and faithful servant, one not given to flights of fancy, and Mr. Carlyle gazed at her in very amazement.

Text: “Hurry, the man is as insane as the rest,” Mr. Norton said.  “Yes, sir,” I said, noticing a new note in his voice.  The balcony was now as noisy as the floor below. The girls and drunken vets were stumbling about with drinks in their hands. Just as we went past an open door Edna saw us and grabbed my arm.  “Where you taking white-folks?” she demanded.  “Back to school,” I said, shaking her off.  “You don’t want to go up there, white-folks, baby,” she said. I tried to push past her. “I ain’t lying,” she said. “I’m the best little home-maker in the business.”  “Okay, but please let us alone,” I pleaded. “You’ll get me into trouble.”  We were going down the stairs into the milling men now and she started to scream, “Pay me then! If he’s too good for me, let him pay!”  And before I could stop her she had pushed Mr. Norton, and both of us were stumbling swiftly down the stairs. I landed against a man who looked up with the anonymous familiarity of a drunk and shoved me hard away. I saw Mr. Norton spin past as I sank farther into the crowd. Somewhere I could hear the girl screaming and Halley’s voice yelling, “Hey! Hey! Hey, now!” Then I was aware of fresh air and saw that I was near the door and pushed my way free and stood panting and preparing to plunge back for Mr. Norton—when I heard Halley calling, “Make way y’all!” and saw him piloting Mr. Norton to the door.

Text: SENSE AND SENSIBILITY  by Jane Austen  (1811)     CHAPTER 1   The family of Dashwood had long been settled in Sussex. Their estate was large, and their residence was at Norland Park, in the centre of their property, where, for many generations, they had lived in so respectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of their surrounding acquaintance. The late owner of this estate was a single man, who lived to a very advanced age, and who for many years of his life, had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister. But her death, which happened ten years before his own, produced a great alteration in his home; for to supply her loss, he invited and received into his house the family of his nephew Mr. Henry Dashwood, the legal inheritor of the Norland estate, and the person to whom he intended to bequeath it. In the society of his nephew and niece, and their children, the old Gentleman's days were comfortably spent. His attachment to them all increased. The constant attention of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Dashwood to his wishes, which proceeded not merely from interest, but from goodness of heart, gave him every degree of solid comfort which his age could receive; and the cheerfulness of the children added a relish to his existence.

Text:  Pray come again some evening ; Mr. Lydgate will like to hear the music, and I cannot enjoy it so well without him.   When her husband was at home again, Rosamond said, standing in front of him, and holding his coat collar with both her hands, " Mr. Ladislaw was here sincjing with me when Mrs. Casaubon came in. He seemed vexed. Do you think he disliked her seeing him at our house ? Surely your position is more than equal to his, — whatever may be his relation to the Casaubons. "  " No no ; it must be something else if he were really vexed. Ladislaw is a sort of gypsy , he thinks nothing of leather and prunella. "   228 MIDDLEMARCH.  " Music apart, he is not always very agreeable. Do you like him ? "  " Yes ; I think he is a good fellow : rather miscellaneous and iric d lrac, but likable. "  " Do you know, I think he adores Mrs. Casaubon. "  " Poor devil ! " said Lydgate, smiling and pinching his wife's ears.
