You are a helpful assistant classifying text into categories. You will be shown a text, and your task is to infer the passage of narrative time in the text, expressed in minutes. 
Express how many minutes have passed in the text. If there are no explicit references to time in the text, infer how much time passed based on the events described. Descriptions can imply the passage of time by mentioning earlier history of people or buildings. References to the past or future in spoken dialogue should not count as time that passed.

Example 1:
Text: “This the way to Fernly Park, mister?” asked the stranger in a hoarse voice.  I looked at him. He was wearing a hat pulled down over his eyes, and his coat collar turned up. I could see little or nothing of his face, but he seemed a young fellow. The voice was rough and uneducated.  “These are the lodge gates here,” I said.  “Thank you, mister.” He paused, and then added, quite unnecessarily, “I’m a stranger in these parts, you see.”  He went on, passing through the gates as I turned to look after him.  The odd thing was that his voice reminded me of someone’s voice that I knew, but whose it was I could not think.  Ten minutes later I was at home once more. Caroline was full of curiosity to know why I had returned so early. I had to make up a slightly fictitious account of the evening in order to satisfy her, and I had an uneasy feeling that she saw through the transparent device.  At ten o’clock I rose, yawned, and suggested bed. Caroline acquiesced.  It was Friday night, and on Friday night I wind the clocks. I did it as usual, whilst Caroline satisfied herself that the servants had locked up the kitchen properly.  It was a quarter past ten as we went up the stairs. I had just reached the top when the telephone rang in the hall below.

Text: He then assured them, that since indulgence had only encouraged intrusion, he would for the future be severe;  vere; and concluded with declaring, that the first man who should disturb him with a repetition of such ridiculous apprehensions, or should attempt to disturb the peace of the castle by circulating these idle notions, should be rigorously punished, and banished his dominions. They shrunk back at this reproof, and were silent. "Bring a torch," said the marquis, "and shew me to the dungeon. I will once more condescend to confute you." They obeyed, and descended with the marquis, who, arriving at the dungeon, instantly threw open the door, and discovered to the astonished eyes of his attendants Ferdinand! He started with surprize at the entrance of his father thus attended. The marquis darting upon him a severe look, which he perfectly comprehended "Now," cried he, turning to his people, "what do you see? My son, whom I myself placed here, and whose voice, which  answered to your calls, you have transformed into unknown sounds. "Speak, Ferdinand, and confirm what I say." Ferdinand did so. "What dreadful spectre appeared to you last night? Resumed the marquis, looking stedfastly upon him: gratify these fellows with a description of it, for they cannot exist without something of the marvelous." "None my lord," replied Ferdinand, who too well understood the manner of the marquis. "Tis well," cried the marquis, "and this is the last time," turning to his attendants, "that your folly shall be treated with so much lenity."

Text: 174 THE LAST DAYS OF POMPEII. which, by corridors at the right and left, gave access to these seats, at either end of the oval arena, were also the entrances for the combatants. Strong palings at these passages prevented any unwelcome eccentricity in the movements of the beasts, and confined them to their appointed prey. Around the parapet which was raised above the arena, and from which the seats gradually rose, were gladiatorial inscriptions, and paintings wrought in fresco, typical of the entertainments for which the place was designed. Throughout the whole building wound invisible pipes, from which, as the day advanced, cooling and fragrant showers were to be sprinkled over the spectators. The officers of the amphitheatre were still employed in the task of fixing the vast awning (or velaria) which covered the whole, and which luxurious invention the Campanians arrogated to themselves : it was woven of the whitest Apulian wool, and variegated with broad stripes of crimson. Owing either to some inexperience on the part of the workmen, or to some defect in the machinery, the awning, however, was not arranged that day so happily as usual: indeed, from the immense space of the circumference, the task was always one of great difficulty and art; so much so, that it could seldom be adventured in rough or windy weather 15ut the present day was so remarkably still that there seemed to the spectators no excuse for the awkwardness of the artificers; and when a large gap in the back of the awning was still visible, from the obstinate refusal of one part of the velaria to ally itself with the rest, the murmurs of discontent were loud and general.

Text: I think I see what you mean, said Isabel.  "Where's the letter you told me he had written me?" her husband demanded.  "I haven't the least idea; I haven't asked him."  "You stopped it on the way," said Osmond.  Isabel slowly got up; standing there in her white cloak, which covered her to her feet, she might have represented the angel of disdain, first cousin to that of pity. "Oh, Gilbert, for a man who was so fine--!" she exclaimed in a long murmur.  "I was never so fine as you. You've done everything you wanted. You've got him out of the way without appearing to do so, and you've placed me in the position in which you wished to see me--that of a man who has tried to marry his daughter to a lord, but has grotesquely failed."  "Pansy doesn't care for him. She's very glad he's gone," Isabel said.  "That has nothing to do with the matter."  "And he doesn't care for Pansy."  "That won't do; you told me he did. I don't know why you wanted this particular satisfaction," Osmond continued; "you might have taken some other. It doesn't seem to me that I've been presumptuous--that I have taken too much for granted. I've been very modest about it, very quiet. The idea didn't originate with me. He began to show that he liked her before I ever thought of it. I left it all to you."

Text: SENSE AND SENSIBILITY  by Jane Austen  (1811)     CHAPTER 1   The family of Dashwood had long been settled in Sussex. Their estate was large, and their residence was at Norland Park, in the centre of their property, where, for many generations, they had lived in so respectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of their surrounding acquaintance. The late owner of this estate was a single man, who lived to a very advanced age, and who for many years of his life, had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister. But her death, which happened ten years before his own, produced a great alteration in his home; for to supply her loss, he invited and received into his house the family of his nephew Mr. Henry Dashwood, the legal inheritor of the Norland estate, and the person to whom he intended to bequeath it. In the society of his nephew and niece, and their children, the old Gentleman's days were comfortably spent. His attachment to them all increased. The constant attention of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Dashwood to his wishes, which proceeded not merely from interest, but from goodness of heart, gave him every degree of solid comfort which his age could receive; and the cheerfulness of the children added a relish to his existence.
