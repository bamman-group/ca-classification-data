You are a helpful assistant classifying text into categories. You will be shown a text, and your task is to classify it as a number within the Aarne-Thompson-Uther index of tale types. Many folktales share the same patterns of motifs, or "tale types". The Aarne-Thompson-Uther tale typology uses a numeric system (1-2399) to label these types. We will consider the set of types listed below; the name of category follows "Label" and a description of it can be found after "Description".

* Label: 1319. Description: Pumpkin Sold as an Donkey's Egg. A numskull (numskulls) finds (buys) an unknown fruit (pumpkin, melon, etc.). He mistakes it for the egg of a donkey (mare, camel, etc.). When the fool tries to bring the 'egg' home it falls down and scares a hidden hare (rabbit, fox, mouse). The fool thinks the fugitive is a young animal hatched from the egg. He pursues it or tries to attract it. Cf. Types 1218, 1739, and 1750.
* Label: 1641. Description: Doctor Know-All. A farmer named Crab (Cricket, Rat) dresses as a doctor and calls himself Doctor Know-All. In exchange for food and lodging for three days, he offers to discover who stole a ring (treasure) from a rich man (king). He is to be hanged if he fails. When servants enter the room (at the end of the three days), he says, 'That is the first (second, third).' The servants believe he has discovered their theft, and admit to having stolen the ring. To prove his power, he must say what is inside a covered dish (closed fist). He has no idea and bemoans, 'Poor Crab (Cricket, Rat)!' He is lucky that this is the right answer. He gives a purgative to a person whose horse had been stolen. When the person has to go outside, he discovers his missing horse. Or Dr. Know-All hides the horse himself and then discovers it. In variants from northern Europe, he becomes a clergyman. He impresses the local farmers with his short and incomprehensible sermons (when his pulpit suddenly collapses, because it had been sawed through. Cf. Type 1825C).
* Label: 1645. Description: The Treasure at Home. A man dreams that he finds a treasure on a bridge in a distant city. He goes to find it but is unsuccessful. While he is there, he tells his dream to a man (beggar), who in turn relates a similar dream in which he found a treasure in the house of the first man. When the first man returns home, he finds the treasure there. Cf. Type 834.
* Label: 1540. Description: The Student from Paradise (Paris). A student (beggar, traveler, clergyman) tells a (foolish) woman that he comes from Paris. She understands this to be Paradise. (Or, he sings, 'I come from heaven,' or says he comes from the beyond or is a messenger from hell). The wife tells him that her husband (son) died shortly before. The student claims to have met him in paradise (hell) and tells her that her husband needs certain things. The wife gives the student money (clothes, food, horse, etc.) to take to her husband. The oldest son (brother-in-law, husband) goes after the trickster to retrieve the money. The trickster steals his horse (the son runs his own horse to death). Cf. Type 1540A*.
* Label: 1586. Description: The Man in Court for Killing a Fly. (Including the previous Types 163A*, 1433*, and 1586A.) This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A man (farmer, baker, fool) goes to court, accusing flies of stealing (previously Type 1433*). The judge (mayor, czar) decrees that the man may kill whatever flies he can. A fly lands on the judge's nose (cheek), and the complainant carries out the sentence. The judge is injured or killed, but no one can accuse the foolish fly-killer. (2) A fool (several fools) tries to kill (shoo away) a fly (several flies, bees, etc.) with an unsuitable instrument (ax, cannon, sword, gun, etc.). He accidentally kills the person whom the insect had been bothering. (Previously Type 1586A.) Cf. Type 248. In some variants the killer is an (tame) animal (e.g. bear, monkey). (Previously Type 163A*.)
* Label: 1676. Description: The Pretended Ghost (previously Joker Posing as Ghost Punished by Victim). (Including the previous Type 1676A.) A man (girl) spends the night (keeps watch) in a graveyard (haunted place). A trickster (several men) decides to frighten him by pretending to be a ghost (dead man). The watcher beats (injures) the false ghost (drives him away). Cf. Types 1532, 1711*. In some variants, the victim does not defend himself. An unknown creature (the devil, in African American variants, e.g. a monkey in disguise) frightens (injures, drives away) the false ghost. (Previously Type 1676A.)
* Label: 1696. Description: 'What Should I Have Said (Done)' Miscellaneous type. (Including the previous Type 1696A*.) A mother tells her stupid son (man tells his wife) what he should have said (done) in a particular situation. The son follows the advice at the next opportunity, where it turns out to be inappropriate.

Cf. Types 1681A, 1681B, and 1691B.
* Label: 1430. Description: The Man and his Wife Build Air Castles. (Including the previous Type 1681*.) This tale exists chiefly in three different forms: (1) A poor married couple (father and son, two brothers, herdsmen, maidservants, other people) plan to turn their possessions (glassware, milk, honey, eggs, money) into great wealth (herds of animals, houses). As they imagine this wealth, they destroy what they already have. (2) A person (poor man, hunter, Gypsy, married couple) dreams of having a valuable possession (catch from hunting, etc.), which he then tries to obtain. His efforts fail because he imagines his success (e.g. the hunter is so excited that he frightens his prey). (3) A married couple (other people) imagine that they will obtain the means to achieve future wealth, but they disagree about how to manage it. One wants to keep reinvesting the future profits, while the other wants to enjoy part of the wealth.
* Label: 1351. Description: The Silence Wager. A man and his wife make a wager: Whoever speaks first must do certain work (close the door, wash the dishes, feed the animals, etc.). Strangers (robbers) enter their house and take or abuse their belongings (believe the couple are dead and share their estate). A man rapes the woman (a woman tries to rape the man). The husband (wife) protests (becomes jealous), cries out, and thus loses the wager.
* Label: 1365. Description: The Obstinate Wife. This miscellaneous type refers to a circle of related anecdotes dealing with a married couple each of which insists on being right. The wife in particular is blamed for being obstinate. It combines episodes of the Types 1365A, 1365B, and 1365C.
* Label: 231. Description: The Heron and the Fish (previously The Heron Transports the Fish). A heron (crane) tells the fish that their lake is drying up.

This tale exists chiefly three different forms: (1) A lion (tiger, bear, elephant) catches a mouse (squirrel, rat) (the mouse disturbs his sleep). The mouse begs for its freedom and promises to come to the rescue of the lion in the future. The lion laughs but sets the mouse free. Later, when the lion is caught in a net (pit, or tied with a rope), the mouse comes and gnaws him free (fills the hole with sand). (2) A mouse (rat) runs under a net where a cat is also caught. When the danger is past, the mouse gnaws the net to free the cat out of gratitude that the cat did not eat him. The mouse says he regrets that a longer friendship between the two of them will not be possible. (3) A lion asks a mouse to rescue him from a net. In return, the mouse asks to marry the lion's daughter. The lion at first refuses but then agrees to the marriage. The lioness (accidentally) treads on the mouse. Cf. Type 233B.
* Label: 92. Description: The Lion Dives for his own Reflection. (Including the previous Type 92A.) A fox (hare) has to supply a lion every day with his dinner. One day he pretends to have met a stronger lion (who took the dinner). The first lion wants to fight against the second. The fox takes him to a well and shows him his reflection. The lion takes it for his rival, jumps in (is pushed in), and drowns. In some variants a hare drives an elephant (several elephants) out of the realm of the hares by showing it a reflection of the moon in water, seemingly quivering with anger. (Previously Type 92A.) Cf. Types 34, 34A, 1168A, and 1336.
* Label: 2. Description: The Tail-Fisher. A bear (wolf) meets a fox who has caught a big load of fish. He asks him where he caught them, and the fox replies that he was fishing with his tail through a hole in the ice. He advises the bear to do likewise and the bear does. When the bear tries to pull his tail out of the ice (because men or dogs are attacking him), it is frozen in place. He runs away but leaves his tail behind. Cf. Type 1891.
* Label: 20C. Description: The Animals Flee in Fear of the End of the World. (Including the previous Type 2033.) A chicken (cat, mouse) is frightened by a nut (acorn, leaf) that falls on its head (tail), or another animal is frightened by a noise (a fart). The chicken thinks this is a sign of an approaching war (the end of the world, the sky is falling down), and flees in panic together with the rooster (they go to tell the king about the disaster). They meet other animals (e.g. goose, hare, dog, bear, wolf, fox) who come to share their fear and go along with them. The misunderstanding is cleared up, or the animals fall into a pit (see Type 20A). In some variants they arrive at the fox's den. The fox invites them inside and eats them (see Type 20D*).

The man does not recognize either the voice or the name of the dead person. When he comes home he tells what happened. When the maid (cat) hears this, she says she has to leave (is now the new king of the cats), goes away, and never comes back. In some variants a man kills a cat that follows him. Before she dies, the cat tells the man to inform a particular person of her death. When the man comes home and tells what happened, his own cat kills him.
* Label: 124. Description: Blowing the House In. (Including the previous Type 124A*.) A goose builds a house of feathers, a hog one of stone. A wolf (bear) blows the goose's house down and eats her. He cannot blow down the hog's house.

Cf. Type 210.
* Label: 155. Description: The Ungrateful Snake Returned to Captivity. A man rescues a snake (wolf, bear, tiger) from a trap. In return the snake seeks to kill the rescuer.

* Label: 2025. Description: The Fleeing Pancake. A pancake (pudding, cake, cookie, cabbage strudel, round bread) jumps out of the pan (plate) and runs away from the cook (mother) who wants to eat it. The pancake runs outside and meets a series of animals (hen, rooster, duck, goose, fox, pig) or people who also want to eat it. The pancake runs away from all of them, bragging about all the others it has already escaped from. The fox (pig) induces the pancake to come close by pretending to be deaf, and gobbles it up. The pig drops part of the pancake, so now all pigs root around in the mud looking for it.
* Label: 275. Description: The Race between Two Animals (previously The Race of the Fox and the Crayfish). See Types 275A'275C, 275C*. Cf. Types 103C*, 221, 221A, 221B, 250, 1072, and 1074.

They have a boy (by supernatural birth) the size of a thumb. Thumbling takes food to his father on the farm and drives the wagon (plow) by sitting in the horse's (ox's) ear. He allows himself to be sold to strangers and then runs away from them. He lets himself be sold to thieves and accompanies them while they steal. Thumbling either helps them or he betrays them by his shouting; he then robs the thieves. Cf. Type 1525E. He is swallowed by a cow, talks from the cow's insides and reappears (in the sausage prepared from the intestines of the slaughtered cow). Someone takes the intestines (sausage) and, frightened by Thumbling's voice inside, throws them away. Thumbling is swallowed by a wolf (fox) who eats the intestines. He talks from the wolf's belly and the wolf becomes sick and frightens (warns) shepherds. The wolf dies (is killed) and Thumbling is rescued, or he persuades the wolf to take him to his father's house. Cf. Type 327B.
* Label: 706. Description: The Maiden without Hands. (Including the previous Type 706A.) A girl has her hands cut off because she refuses to marry her father (because her father has sold her to the devil, forbids her to pray, her sister-in-law has slandered her to her brother). She is exposed in the forest and eats fruit from a garden. A king finds her in the forest (garden, stable, sea) and marries her in spite of her mutilation. She gives birth but is cast out along with her children, because her parents-in-law (father, mother, sister-in-law, devil) alter a letter from the king.

(Polyphemus, Tepeg'z) A man (together with others) who is traveling (in a forest, in the wilderness) accidentally comes to the cave (hut) of an (one-eyed) ogre living alone (with his mother) and tending sheep. The ogre catches the man and threatens to devour him. The man pretends to be a physician and promises to heal the ogre's eye(s) (the ogre falls asleep). The man heats a metal spear, thrusts it into the ogre's eye, and escapes from the blinded ogre by covering himself with a sheepskin or by hiding under the belly of a ram that walks out of the cave. Cf. Types 953, 1135. In some variants, the ogre later tries to recapture the man by using a magic ring (object) which compels the fugitive to keep calling out,'Here I am'. The man succeeds in escaping from the ogre once more: He cuts off his finger with the ring and throws it into the sea. The ogre goes after the ring and is drowned.
* Label: 1161. Description: The Bear Trainer and his Bear. (Including the previous Type 957.) A bear trainer with his (polar) bear comes to a mill (farmhouse) and requests quarters for the night. The miller (farmer) gives him a room and tells him that the house is haunted by an ogre (giant, devil, demon, ghost, goblin, troll). During the night, the ogre appears and starts to attack the guests, but the bear hurts and expels him. Since this night, the building has not been haunted. After a long absence, the ogre comes back and asks the farmer whether he still has the big (white) cat. The man answers that the cat in the meantime has given birth to four (seven) kittens. The ogre vows never to come again.
* Label: 980. Description: The Ungrateful Son (previously Ungrateful Son Reproved by Naive Actions of Own Son). (Including the previous Types 980A'C.) This miscellanous type comprises various tales dealing with ungrateful children (son, daughter-in-law) of an ageing father. They think about and eventually change their behavior because of the analogous actions of their own son (daughter). (1) When an aged father is banned from the table and served his meals in a wooden cup by his son and his daughter-in-law, the little grandson starts to build a similar cup for his parents to use when they grow old. Thereupon the couple starts to reflect on their undignified behavior. Thinking of their own old age, they bring the old father back to the family table. (Previously Type 980B.) (2) A son gives his father half a blanket (carpet, cape, cloth) to keep warm. Thereupon the little grandson keeps the other half of the blanket and explains that he will save it for his parents for when they are old. (Previously Type 980A.) (3) An aged father is abandoned by his son in the wilderness (abyss) in a cart (sledge, basket). The grandson keeps it in order to use it in the same way for his parents when they have grown old (cf. Type 981). They reflect on their behavior. (Previously Type 980C.) (4) The ungrateful son drags his old father out of the house by pulling at his hair.

* Label: 981. Description: Wisdom of Hidden Old Man Saves Kingdom. During a famine (war), the young people have an assembly and decide (the emperor orders) that all old and seemingly useless men should be killed. One man hides his father. When everything goes wrong under the young rulers, the wise old man comes forth and saves the situation with his good advice (he helps perform difficult tasks with his wisdom). Thereupon he is honored and the custom of killing old people is abandoned. In some variants the son, who intends to kill his father, realizes that the same will happen to him when he is old, and lets his father live. Cf. Types 921B and 980.
* Label: 982. Description: The Pretended Inheritance (previously Supposed Chest of Gold Induces Children to Care for Aged Father). Trusting to his children's care when he is old, a rich man leaves all his property to them. They soon forget their intentions and neglect their father. Thereupon the old man plans a ruse: He starts counting money conspicuously and points to a chest giving the advice that it contains another considerable inheritance. Thereupon the children change their behavior and look after their father carefully. When the father finally dies they find only sand and stones in the chest. In some variants they find a mace with the advice that it should be used to kill anyone stupid enough to give away his inheritance before his death.
* Label: 1030. Description: The Crop Division. The devil (ogre, bear) and a farmer (God, saint, Gypsy, fox) want to divide the crop. In the first year, the devil claims what grows above the ground. The farmer plants turnips (potatoes), and the devil only gets the greens. In the following year they want to divide the other way. The farmer sows wheat (other kinds of grain, cabbage) and the devil, who gets what is growing beneath the ground, again comes away empty-handed. Cf. Types 9, 1633.
* Label: 954. Description: The Forty Thieves. (Ali Baba). (Including the previous Type 676.) The tale consists of two parts: (1) A poor man (woodcutter) witnesses robbers entering into a mountain by pronouncing magic words like 'Open, sesame'. He then tries the formula, enters the mountain, and finds a huge amount of gold which he takes home. (2) His greedy brother, who lends him money scales, discovers his secret when a piece of gold remains in the scale. The brother goes to the mountain, but he is dismembered by the robbers because he forgets the formula for opening the mountain. At the request of his sister-in-law, the woodcutter fetches his brother's corpse, tells a cobbler to mend it and buries it. The robbers plan to take revenge. With the cobbler's help they find the house of Ali Baba and mark it with a chalk circle, whereupon his maidservant (daughter) marks all other houses in the same way. The robber chief disguises himself as a merchant and asks the woodcutter for lodging for the night for himself and for his mules laden with jars (casks) of oil. When the maidservant goes to take some oil for her lamp, she realizes that only one jar is filled with oil, and that the robber's companions are hidden in the others. She heats the oil, pours it into the jars, and kills the robbers. The robber captain escapes and comes back in disguise (as a suitor). At dinner he asks for a meal without salt (in order not to be obliged to his host). Thereupon the maidservant becomes suspicious, recognizes the robber, and kills him. As her reward the woodcutter marries her to his son (nephew).
* Label: 955. Description: The Robber Bridegroom. A robber (murderer, ogre) disguised as a rich man woos the daughter of a miller (princess) who agrees to marry him. The bridegroom asks his bride to pay him a visit in his castle in the forest. She sets out before the arranged time, marking the path with peas or ashes (the bridegroom has marked the way). When she reaches a house, animals (bird) warn her that it is a house of murderers and that she should go back (she gives food to watch dogs in order not to be betrayed). She finds corpses in the house. When she hears the robbers coming, she hides. Her bridegroom (the robbers) brings in a young woman, kills her, and cuts her into pieces. Her finger with a golden ring on it falls into her hiding place. The bride runs away at night and finds her way home safely (with the help of the marks on the path) where she reports to her family what she has seen. When the bridegroom comes to marry her, she recounts her adventure to her guests as a dream. As proof she shows the severed ring (finger). The robbers are arrested and condemned or killed. (The house of the robbers is destroyed, their treasure is distributed, and the girl marries another man.) Cf. Type 311.
* Label: 958E*. Description: Deep Sleep Brought on by a Robber. A robber, disguised as a beggar, gets lodging for the night at a farmhouse. Using a candle made of human fat (hand of corpse), he tries to charm the household into deep sleep. One of the household who has not gone to sleep sees this and kills the robber. The rest of the family does not wake up until twenty-four hours later.
* Label: 1191. Description: Sacrifice on the Bridge (previously The Dog on the Bridge). A master builder is not able to finish a bridge or church (within a fixed time) and asks the devil (ogre) for help. The devil demands in return the first being that crosses the bridge (comes into the church). The master builder drives an animal (e.g. dog, wolf, cat, rooster, pig, goat) across the bridge (into the church), so the devil is cheated out of his human soul. Because its central element corresponds to Type 1191, the following version is included here: A king vows to sacrifice the first thing he meets, which turns out to be a miller driving a donkey. When the miller is about to be killed, he pleads that the donkey was in front of him. The donkey is beheaded.
* Label: 850. Description: The Birthmarks of the Princess. A princess is promised in marriage to whoever is able to describe her birthmarks. A young swineherd (shepherd, tailor) has hogs (geese) that dance to his magic flute. In return for his dancing hogs the princess lets the shepherd boy see her naked and thus he comes to know her secret birthmarks. Or a fisherman offers the princess colorful fishes. In return she undresses herself three times, so that finally he knows the answer. Another suitor (rich man) guesses the answer. As both rivals have solved the riddle, the king then gives a further test: the princess is to marry the suitor to whom she turns in the night. The rivals sleep with her and she turns to the shepherd (because his rival has eaten bad-smelling food or has soiled the bed). Cf. Types 851, 852, and 857.
* Label: 780. Description: The Singing Bone. A brother (sister) kills his (her) brother (sister) and buries him (her) in the earth. From the bones a shepherd makes an instrument (harp, violin, flute) which brings the secret to light. Or the murder is revealed by a (speaking) tree growing from the grave. Cf. Type 720.
* Label: 763. Description: The Treasure Finders who Murder One Another. Three (two, more) men (hunters, friends, brothers) find (rob) a treasure. When one of them goes to town to fetch some food, the others plan to murder one another in order not to share the treasure. Those who stayed kill (stab to death, drown) the one who left when he returns, but they die later from eating bread (wine) which he had poisoned. In some variants Christ travels with some of his followers. When they find a treasure he tells them not to touch it but to continue their way. Later two of them return secretly to take the treasure and they murder one another. Or, two men find the treasure and murder one another. When Christ and his followers find them dead, Christ explains that this was the reason why he told them not to take the treasure.
* Label: 777. Description: The Wandering Jew. Christ carries the cross to Golgotha. When he wants to rest for a moment, a Jew (shoemaker), who owns the house there, does not permit it. From then on the Jew has to wander about on earth forever, unable to die. Cf. Type 750E (7).
* Label: 779. Description: Miscellaneous Divine Rewards and Punishments. (Including the previous Types 779A*'C*.)

* Label: 562. Description: The Spirit in the Blue Light. A discharged soldier (deserter) is asked by an old woman (witch) to fetch for her a fire-steel (light, tinder-box, candle) from an underground treasury (magic castle) guarded by dogs. He keeps it for himself (kills the old woman). He discovers that when he lights the fire-steel a helpful spirit (dogs, iron man, giant) appears. He orders the spirit to bring the princess to him during three successive nights. She has to serve him (he kisses her, impregnates her). The king tries to discover where his daughter goes by putting a mark on the door. The spirit discovers the ruse and defeats it by putting the same mark on all the houses. The third time the soldier takes the princess, he is discovered (gives up himself) and imprisoned. He asks for his fire-steel, and before he is executed he asks for permission to smoke for one last time. When he lights his fire-steel, the spirit appears and rescues him (and imprisons the king instead). By threatening violence the soldier forces the king to agree that he may marry his daughter. Cf. Types 560, 561. In some variants the spirit is disenchanted by being beheaded or when the candle is burned up.
* Label: 571B. Description: Lover Exposed (previously The Himphamp). (Including the previous Type 571A.) A man falls in love with the wife of a smith (craftsman, farmer). In order to get rid of the husband he denounces him to the master (of the castle), pretending that the husband practices magic. The master thereupon orders him to perform (three) impossible tasks, of which the last one is to make a 'Himphamp' ' a fictional word without any meaning. The husband gets help (from the devil, supernatural being) to solve the tasks, the last one by a magic formula that makes things stick together. He surprises the loving couple in bed and makes them stick together (to the chamber pot). Or, a man learns that his wife has commited adultery. By means of a magic sticking formula (magician) he makes the loving couple (clergyman and his wife) stick naked to the chamber pot (basin) (previously Type 571A). Helpful servants get also stuck. The next day the man leads the chain of persons through the streets. Other people (farmhand, maidservant), animals (cow, bull) and objects (food) get stuck in obcene situations and are mocked by passers-by. The man presents his 'Himphamp' to the master. All are released, and the guilty ones are punished, made to pay compensation, or pardoned. They promise to reform, they escape, or they drown themselves.
* Label: 592. Description: The Dance Among Thorns. A poor boy, driven from home by his evil stepmother (dismissed from service with a pittance), gives all his money as alms to a beggar (supernatural being) who in return grants the boy three wishes: a never failing gun (crossbow), a fiddle (flute) that compels people to dance, another magic object or the magic power of having his wishes obeyed. He shoots a bird (on a wager), which falls into a thornbush. When a monk (Jew, the loser of the wager) tries to take the bird out, the boy's magic fiddle makes him dance in the thorns. The boy is condemned and led to the gallows. He asks for permission to play his fiddle for the last time. The judge and whole assembly have to dance until the boy is released.
* Label: 613. Description: The Two Travelers. (Truth and Falsehood). (Including the previous Types 613*, 613A*, and 613B*). Two men (travelers, brothers, tailor and cobbler) argue (wager) about whether truth or falsehood (justice or unjustice, whose religion) is more powerful. They call on animals and people they meet to act as judges. The loser (the one who stands for the truth) is robbed and blinded, or the wicked man shares his bread with his hungry companion only if he will let his eyes be put out. The blind man spends the night in (under) a tree, where he overhears secrets of birds (other animals, devils, ogres, witches). By means of this knowledge he is able to restore his sight, to cure sickness (of the princess, king), to end drought, etc.. He is rewarded (marries the princess). His companion, intending to acquire the same wealth, imitates him. He goes to the same tree (sometimes also blinded), but the birds (devils) think it was he who betrayed their secrets, and tear him to pieces.
* Label: 451. Description: The Maiden Who Seeks her Brothers. (Including the previous Types 451A and 451*.) A girl rescues her twelve (seven, three, six) brothers who had been transformed into animals (birds). This tale exists chiefly in three different forms but they are often mixed with each other: (1) A stepmother transforms her stepsons into swans (ravens). The sister looks for her brothers and finds out how to release them: She has to be silent for some years and has to make shirts out of cotton-grass for the brothers. A king finds the young woman in the forest and marries her. In his absence she bears a child, but her mother-in-law takes it away and accuses her of eating the child (having borne an animal). The young queen remains silent because of her brothers, even though she is to be executed. On her way to the funeral pyre her period of silence ends and her brothers are disenchanted. Everything is explained and the mother-in-law is punished. In some variants the disenchantment of one brother is not complete (he keeps a wing) because the sister cried a tear when her child was taken away (did not completely finish his shirt). (2) A girl finds her brothers in a remote place and keeps house for them. They tell her to take care of the cat (dog), watch the fire, and be careful of the demonic neighbor (ogre, witch). Once she forgets to divide her food with the cat, so it puts out the fire. After the girl asks the neighbor for help, the ogre comes regularly to suck her blood. When the brothers discover this, they kill him. The girl takes flowers (herbs) from the grave of the ogre. Her brothers eat them and they are changed into oxen (sheep, birds). The episode of disenchantment is less important. (3) A mother (father) curses her sons because there is not enough to eat. They are transformed into ravens (swans). The sister seeks for them and asks for directions from the sun, moon, and stars. She finds her brothers on a glass mountain (glass palace). To reach them she needs a little bone as a key (gets help from the wind). She releases her brothers and they go back home. In some variants the episode with marriage and slander follows. Some variants start with the promise of the mother to sacrifice the brothers if a daughter (one more brother) is born. She tries to inform the boys after the birth by a sign, but the wrong sign is sent, so the brothers leave home.
* Label: 425C. Description: Beauty and the Beast. (Including the previous Type 425H.) A merchant sets out on a journey and intends to bring back presents for his three daughters. The two elder ones demand jewels and clothes, the youngest a rose. The father is not able to find one. He loses his way and stays overnight in a deserted castle, where he breaks off a rose. An (invisible) animal (beast) demands that the man return or send a substitute. The youngest daughter meets her father's obligation but refuses to marry the (ugly) animal, who treats her kindly. In a magic mirror she sees her father is ill. She is allowed to visit him but (influenced by her envious sisters) overstays the allotted time. She returns and finds the animal near death, realizes she loves him, and caresses or kisses him. By this means she disenchants the prince from his animal shape. They marry.
* Label: 440. Description: The Frog King or Iron Henry. A young princess (youngest of three sisters) drops her golden ball into a well, and a frog gives it back to her. (In some variants the frog helps her with some other difficulty.) He makes her promise him that he may eat from her plate, drink from her cup, and sleep in her bed. The animal comes for his reward and the king insists the princess do as she had promised. Angry, she throws the frog at the wall and he turns into a handsome prince. In some variants the frog is disenchanted by means of a kiss, marriage, from being decapitated, etc.. In the Grimms' version: When the prince takes the princess home in his carriage, they meet his faithful servant Henry, whose heart had broken when the prince was enchanted. The iron bands that had held it together break from joy. In some variants the bride has the iron bands on her heart, and they break from pain, not from joy. After the disenchantment, both partners may be put to a test. The princess searches all over the world for her bridegroom, and he must identify his true bride. Cf. Types 313, 425A.
* Label: 441. Description: Hans my Hedgehog. A previously-childless couple (because of a hasty wish or a curse) have a son who is a hedgehog. He becomes a swineherd in the forest, where the pigs thrive under his care. He gives directions to three (two) kings (merchant, count, king, one king three times, etc.) who have lost their way, and is promised one of their three daughters as his wife. Riding on a rooster, he goes to claim his bride three times. Two of the princesses refuse him and he scratches them, but the third agrees to marry him. On the wedding night (on the way to the church, after they have lived together), the animal's skin is destroyed (the princess kisses the hedgehog, whips him, cuts off his head, etc.). The hedgehog is disenchanted and turns into a handsome young man. (The two other princesses kill themselves from jealousy and anger.) Cf. Types 425C, 433B.
* Label: 402. Description: The Animal Bride (previously The Mouse as Bride). A father is not able to decide which of his (three) sons should inherit his property (kingdom) and sends them all on a quest for one year. They are told to bring back a special object (yarn, linen, fine chain, ring, horse, smallest dog, money) or they must learn a profession. Whoever performs the task best will be the heir. The youngest son, often a fool, goes into a forest and becomes the servant of an animal (cat, rat, frog, mouse). As a payment he is given the object that his father had asked for. It proves to be the most beautiful one, and thus he should be the heir. Because his brothers (parents) are envious, two further tasks are set, and finally the brothers are required to bring a bride (most beautiful woman). The youngest returns to the animal which again promises to help. The animal is disenchanted by burning, mutilation, decapitation, or by crossing a river, and becomes a beautiful princess with a castle. They return happily to his parents as bride and bridegroom. Sometimes they deceive the parents: The youngest son arrives dressed in rags and is ridiculed; then the bride arrives and they reveal their identities. When the son arrives in the first place dressed as a prince, a mole helps to identify him. Often the youngest son renounces his inheritance and goes with his wife back to her castle. In some variants from eastern and southeastern Europe and the Near East, the youngest son takes the animal (often a frog or toad) to his home and hides it from the family. The father assigns tasks to his daughters-in-law which the frog performs best. The last (third) task requires the brides to attend a feast, where the frog turns into the most beautiful woman. The bridegroom burns the frog's skin so that the bride cannot change back. As a consequence she leaves him, and he sets out on a quest and finally is able to retrieve her. Cf. Type 400.
* Label: 306. Description: The Danced-out Shoes. (Including the previous Type 306A.) Every day, a princess(es) wears out a pair of shoes. Her father wants to know why and offers the princess (one of the princesses) to whoever discovers the secret. Anyone who fails will lose his head. A youth (soldier, Gypsy, tailor, shepherd, farmer, etc.)acquires a magic object (e.g. shoes, cap, overcoat, stick) which makes him invisible. He refuses a narcotic drink and does not fall asleep. After making himself invisible, the youth accompanies the princess on a magical underground journey. In the underworld he watches the princess wear out her shoes by dancing with the devil (dragon, other supernatural beings). The next morning the youth tells the king what happened and corroborates his tale by tokens (e.g. twigs, apples, ring, piece of the princess's garment) from the underworld. He marries the princess and becomes king. Cf. Type 507A. Mainly in Indian variants, a prince accompanies his wife to the otherworld where she has to dance each night before a divinity. He frees her. (Previously Type 306A.)
* Label: 311. Description: Rescue by the Sister. Two sisters, one after the other, fall into power of a demonic suitor (cannibal, dragon, magician, devil) and are taken into his (subterranean) castle. There the sisters open a forbidden room full of dead bodies, in the course of which the key (a magic egg, apple) becomes bloody, or they refuse to eat human flesh. The demon kills them for their disobedience. Using a trick, the third (youngest) sister escapes from the same fate. She finds her sisters and resuscitates them by putting their bones together. She hides them beneath some gold in baskets (bags) and persuades the demon to carry the baskets home without looking into them. Cf. Type 1132. The youngest sister pretends to marry the demon and leaves a skull (straw dummy) dressed as a bride to deceive him. Unwittingly the demon carries this sister home in the third basket. Or she smears herself with honey and feathers and escapes as a 'strange bird'. Cf. Types 1383, 1681. The demon is burned in his own house or is killed in another way. Cf. Type 312.
* Label: 327. Description: The Children and the Ogre. This type refers to a cycle of related tales. It combines episodes from types 327A, 327B, and 327C.
* Label: 332. Description: Godfather Death. (Including the previous Types 332A* and 332B*.) A poor man with many children wants a (just) godfather for his newborn son. He refuses God (saint, devil) and chooses death (angel of death, plague) because he treats everyone alike. As a gift the father (son) receives the magic power of forecasting recovery or death, depending on whether death stands at the head or the foot of the sick person's bed. Thus the man becomes a famous doctor and grows wealthy. The doctor betrays death (several times): When promised wealth (the princess), the doctor turns the bed and thus saves the life of a person who was supposed to die (in the doctor's dying hour, death grants him time to say a last Paternoster, but the doctor does not finish the prayer ' cf. Type 1199. Death tricks the doctor into finishing the prayer.) In some variants, death shows the man his life-light in the underworld and suddenly extinguishes it. Or the man attempts to lengthen his life by various means (usually without success). (Previously Type 332A*.) Cf. Type 1187.
* Label: 333. Description: Little Red Riding Hood (previously The Glutton). (Petit Chaperon Rouge, Cappuccetto rosso, Rotk'ppchen.) (Including the previous Type 333A.) A little girl, called 'Red Riding Hood' because of her red cap, is sent to her grandmother who lives in the forest and is warned not to leave the path. On the way she meets a wolf. The wolf learns where the girl is going, hurries on ahead, and devours the grandmother (puts her blood in a glass and her flesh in a pot). He puts on her clothes and lies down in her bed. Red Riding Hood arrives at the grandmother's house. (She has to drink the blood, eat the flesh, and lie down in the bed.) Red Riding Hood doubts whether the wolf is her grandmother and asks him about his odd big ears, eyes, hands, and mouth. Finally the wolf eats Red Riding Hood. A hunter kills the wolf and cuts open his belly. Red Riding Hood and the grandmother are rescued alive. They fill the wolf's belly with stones; he is drowned or falls to his death. Cf. Types 123, 2028. In some variants Red Riding Hood arrives at the grandmother's house before the wolf. The wolf climbs on the roof to wait until Red Riding Hood leaves. The Grandmother who had boiled sausages asks Red Riding Hood to fill the broth into a big trough in front of the house. Enticed by the smell, the wolf falls from the roof and is drowned in the trough. In an Italian version, a woman who is going to bake cakes sends out her daughter (Caterinella, Caterina, Cattarinetta) to borrow a pan. The lender, an ogre (witch, wolf), asks the girl to bring back some cakes and wine. On her way she eats the cakes, drinks the wine, and replaces them with horse-dung and urine. Angry about the trick, the ogre pursues the girl home and devours her (is not able to get into the house, is tricked out by the girl's mother). (Previously Type 333A.)
* Label: 365. Description: The Dead Bridegroom Carries Off his Bride. (Lenore). (Including the previous Type 365A*.)

The bride escapes (is pulled into the grave, danced to death by the dancing dead, or torn to pieces).
* Label: 366. Description: The Man from the Gallows. This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A man (woman, child) takes the liver (lung, heart, stomach, backside) of a corpse who has been hanged (other dead person). At home the meat is eaten (often without knowing what it is). At night the dead person appears, asks for the stolen part of his body, and punishes the perpetrator (eater) by carrying him away (to hell) or by killing him. (2) A child (adult person) who has lost a leg (arm) wears a golden (diamond) one as a substitute. The child dies, and the parents (servants, grave-diggers, etc.)take the golden leg. At night the dead child appears, complains about the loss of his leg, and receives it back.
* Label: 500. Description: The Name of the Supernatural Helper. (e.g. Tom Tit Tot, Rumpelstilzchen, Trillevip.) A father (mother) boasts that his daughter can spin gold or impossible amounts of yarn. Or, a mother beats her daughter because she is lazy. The king asks why and the mother says she will not stop spinning. The young woman's talent is to be tested and she is shut in a room to spin. If she fails she will die, but if she succeeds the king will marry her. She cries. A supernatural being (a little man) agrees to help her if she will promise him her first child (herself) if she cannot guess his name. In some variants she has to remember his name after a long time. The young woman passes the test and the king marries her. After a year the little man, certain that she could not guess his name, comes back to take her child away. By chance the name is discovered (by a servant, the husband or the woman herself) when the little man sings it triumphantly in the forest. When the woman says the correct name to the helper he vanishes or sinks into the earth.
* Label: 502. Description: The Wild Man. A king catches a wild man (Iron John) and puts him into a cage, forbidding anyone to set him free. His son frees the prisoner because his ball rolls into the cage or because he feels pity for him. The prince is afraid of his father's anger and leaves home (his father drives him away to be killed or sends him to another king) along with a servant. On their way the servant persuades the prince to exchange clothes. The prince becomes a servant at the court of another king. At a tournament he appears unrecognized three times on a splendid horse which he received from the wild man and wins the hand of a princess. Or, he wins the princess because he has helped her father in war. Often the wild man is disenchanted. In some variants the prince works for a while at the wild man's house where he disobeys instructions (e.g. looks into a forbidden chamber, cares for a horse although it is not allowed) and his hair turns to gold. Cf. Type 314.
* Label: 503. Description: The Gifts of the Little People. A hunchbacked man takes part in a dance of the witches or people from below the earth (elves, fairies, dwarfs). He sings their song or adds a missing rhyme or more weekdays. As a reward they remove his hump or give him gold.

The little people add the hump of the other man to his own, or give him coals instead of gold. Cf. Type 480D*.
* Label: 510A. Description: Cinderella. (Cenerentola, Cendrillon, Aschenputtel.) A young woman is mistreated by her stepmother and stepsisters and has to live in the ashes as a servant. When the sisters and the stepmother go to a ball (church), they give Cinderella an impossible task (e.g. sorting peas from ashes), which she accomplishes with the help of birds. She obtains beautiful clothing from a supernatural being or a tree that grows on the grave of her deceased mother and goes unknown to the ball. A prince falls in love with her, but she has to leave the ball early. The same thing happens on the next evening, but on the third evening, she loses one of her shoes. The prince will marry only the woman whom the shoe fits. The stepsisters cut pieces off their feet in order to make them fit into the shoe, but a bird calls attention to this deceit. Cinderella who had been first hidden from the prince, tries on the shoe and it fits her. The prince marries her.
* Label: 510B. Description: Peau d'asne (previously The Dress of Gold, of Silver, and of Stars). (Cap o'Rushes, Donkey Skin, All Kinds of Fur, Allerleirauh.) A king promises his wife on her deathbed only to marry another woman who is as beautiful as she is (whom a particular ring fits). Because she is the only one who meets this condition, the king wants to marry his grown daughter. In order to delay the wedding, the young woman asks him to give her dresses like the sun (gold), the moon (silver), and stars (diamonds), and a coat made of many different kinds of fur (a covering of wood). After he provides all these, the daughter runs away from her father and, disguised in the ugly skin, works as a kitchen maid (goose-girl) in another castle. Cf. Types 706, 706C. When a series of feasts is held in the castle where she works, the young woman secretly puts on her splendid dresses. The prince falls in love with her but does not recognize her as the kitchen maid. On the following days he treats the kitchen maid badly. During the feasts he asks the beautiful woman where she comes from, and she gives cryptic answers that refer to how he had treated the kitchen maid. He gives her a ring. Then the prince becomes lovesick. In her character as kitchen maid, she slips his ring into his soup (bread). He finds her and marries her. Sometimes the young woman is discovered while she is bathing or dressing instead of being recognized through a token.
* Label: 545B. Description: Puss in Boots. An animal (cat, fox, jackal, monkey, etc.) intends to help a poor man (out of obligation) to become rich (by marrying him to the princess). In order to gain the emperor's confidence, the animal tells him that the poor man is very wealthy. When the poorly dressed future bridegroom travels to his bride's residence, the animal simulates an accident (robbery), in which all his clothes (horses, bride presents, wedding guests) are lost. Thereupon the king gives the poor man good clothes and he is accepted as a bridegroom. When the man has to display his property, the animal leaves before him and coerces the shepherds and farmers to say that their herds and farmland belong to the poor man. The animal kills the real owner of the properties, a demon (dragon, ogre, giant, witch, magician) by burning, slaying, shooting or through a trick. When the bride arrives with her entourage, the bridegroom presents himself as the real owner of the property. The animal tests the gratitude of the poor man by feigning death (it becomes a human when it is decapitated). In some variants the man behaves ungrateful or does not keep his promise.
* Label: 650A. Description: Strong John. A young man, born of an animal (son of a bear) or from a giant (troll-woman, forged from iron by a smith) develops great strength (at the forge, in the forest, in war, by suckling for many years, by his great appetite, by tests of strength, etc.). Because of his enormous appetite he is sent away from home. He works for a smith but (often) injures his master, who tries to get rid of him by setting trials of strength. The strong man has to uproot trees, to catch wolves and bears (lions, etc.), to tame devils, etc.. When he is sent to catch wild animals, he harnesses them to a coach. When he is in a well and a mill stone (bell) is thrown on him, he wears it as collar or complains that chickens are scratching dirt onto him. When he is sent to the devil's mill (hell), he drives the devil to his master's house. When he goes to the king to be paid, the king shoots him (in vain) with cannons. The strong man accomplishes every task and overcomes all difficulties (kills his master and finally marries).
* Label: 670. Description: The Man who Understands Animal Languages (previously The Animal Languages). A grateful snake gives a man the power to understand animal languages, and tells him that if he reveals the secret, he must die. Once the man hears animals talking and laughs. His curious wife insists on knowing why he does so. Worn down by her nagging, he is about to give in and tell her. Then he hears a rooster say how easily he rules his many wives, while the man cannot rule even his one wife. The man keeps his secret and does not tell her anything. Cf. Types 517, 671, and 673.
* Label: 480. Description: The Kind and the Unkind Girls (previously The Spinning-Women by the Spring. The Kind and the Unkind Girls). A girl is mistreated by her stepmother and has to work very hard. This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A girl loses an object which is carried off by a river (blown away by the wind), and runs after it (a spindle). She comes upon an old woman (ogress) who asks her to clean (disarrange) and to louse her head. When the old woman lets her choose a box as her reward, she choses the plain one. (2) A girl falls into a well (is pushed in, jumps in after an object she has dropped), or follows a rolling cake (ball of yarn, etc.). She encounters various animals, objects, or people who ask her for help: e.g. a cow wants to be milked, an old man or woman to be loused or fed, an oven to be emptied of bread, an apple tree to be shaken. The girl helps them all. Then she arrives at the house of an old woman (Frau Holle, old man, supernatural beings like a giant or the twelve months) where she is assigned tasks: e.g. she has to do the household or farm work, has to feed or louse the demon, has to comb the hair of fairies, has to carry water in a sieve or wash black wool white. She is very helpful and hard-working. In the end she is is rewarded with gold, jewels, etc. , becomes more beautiful, or jewels fall from her mouth. Or, she can choose her reward and is very modest but the reward changes into wealth when she reaches home. In some variants she is forbidden to enter a certain room. When she breaks this rule, she becomes covered with gold and flees. The grateful animals, objects, and people of her outward journey help her escape from the demon. After she arrives home, her envious stepmother sends her own daughter on the same journey. This girl goes through the same situations but she refuses help, disobeys, and is unkind. She is punished severely (frogs fall from her mouth, horns grow on her head, or she is disfigured, beaten or killed). In some variants the stepmother is also punished. In the end the kind young woman often marries a prince. Cf. Types 431, 480A, and 1180.

Here is an example:
Text: But,' says the paddo, 'an ye'll be my wife, I'll gie ye plenty o' water.' And the lassie, no thinking that the poor beast could mean anything serious, said she wad be his wife, for the sake o' getting the water. So she got the water into her dish, and gaed away hame to her mother, and thought nae mair about the paddo, till that night, when, just as she and her mother were about to go their beds, something came to the door, and when they listened, they heard this sang: Says the mother to the dochter, 'What noise is that at the door?' 'Hout,' says the dochter, 'it's naething but a filthy paddo.' 'Open the door,' says the mother, 'to the poor paddo.' So the lassie opened the door, and the paddo came loup-loup-louping in, and sat down by the ingle-side. Then he sings: 'Hout,' quo' the dochter, 'wad I gie a filthy paddo his supper?' 'O ay,' said the mother, 'e'n gie the poor paddo his supper.' So the paddo got his supper; and after that he sings again: 'O ay,' says the mother, 'put the poor paddo to bed.' And so she put the paddo to his bed. (Here let us abridge a little.) Then the paddo sang again:
Thought: This text describes a scene where a "paddo" requests a girl, who is fetching water, to be his wife. Later, the paddo knocks on the door of the girl's home, where the girl feeds him and puts him to bed. These events are similar to those in folktales in ATU category 440 (The Frog King). In these tales, a frog promises to marry a girl by a body of water, later comes to her door, table, or bed, and reveals his true self as a prince or king.
