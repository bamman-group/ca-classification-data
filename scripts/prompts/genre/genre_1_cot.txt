Text: "Now, Marjorie, everything you are thinking is being definitely recorded in another place." For a moment or two the significance of his words did not penetrate to her mind. Then she realized them. Lady Poole and the scientist saw the rapt expression fade away like a lamp that is turned out. Horror flashed out upon it, horror and fear. Her hands went up to her head; she swept off the brilliant helmet and flung it with a crash upon the ground. Then she swayed for a moment and sank into a deep swoon. She had been thinking of Mr. Guy Rathbone, barrister-at-law, and what her thoughts were, who can say? CHAPTER IV THE SECOND LOVER ARRIVES On the evening of the day in which she had fainted, Marjorie Poole sat alone in the drawing-room of her mother's house in Curzon Street. It was a large, handsome place, furnished in the Empire style with mirrors framed in delicate white arabesques, and much gilding woven into the pattern. The carpet was a great purple expanse covered with laurel wreaths of darker purple. There was but little furniture in the big, beautiful place, but it was all airy, fantastic and perfect of its kind. There was a general air of repose, of size and comely proportion in this delightful room. Here, an old French clock clicked merrily, there were two or three inlaid cabinets, and upon the walls were a few copies of some of Watteau's delightful scenes in the old courtly gardens of Versailles. Marjorie wore a long tea-gown, and she was sitting quite alone in the brilliantly lit place, with a book in her hand. The book was in her hand indeed, but she was not reading it. Her eyes were fixed upon the opposite wall, though they saw nothing there. Her thoughts were busy and her face was pale. She had recovered from her swoon in a minute or two, and found her mother fussing round her and her lover generally skilful in doing all that was necessary. And a short time afterwards she had driven home with Lady Poole. What she had heard, the very strain of hearing and being so intensely interested in it, had taken her strength away. Then had come the words when Sir William told her that the very thoughts that she was thinking at that moment were being in some mysterious way recorded and known. And she knew that she had been thinking of another man, thinking of him as an engaged girl should never think. 
Thought: "Everything you are thinking is being definitely recorded" suggests this story is about mind-reading technology, set in a world where thoughts are no longer private.  indicates science fiction. "Lady Poole" and "barrister-at-law" evoke some historical era. This blend of futuristic concepts with historical elements makes this most likely an example of science fiction.
Output: science fiction
