Here are several examples:

Example 1:
Text: "Now, Marjorie, everything you are thinking is being definitely recorded in another place." For a moment or two the significance of his words did not penetrate to her mind. Then she realized them. Lady Poole and the scientist saw the rapt expression fade away like a lamp that is turned out. Horror flashed out upon it, horror and fear. Her hands went up to her head; she swept off the brilliant helmet and flung it with a crash upon the ground. Then she swayed for a moment and sank into a deep swoon. She had been thinking of Mr. Guy Rathbone, barrister-at-law, and what her thoughts were, who can say? CHAPTER IV THE SECOND LOVER ARRIVES On the evening of the day in which she had fainted, Marjorie Poole sat alone in the drawing-room of her mother's house in Curzon Street. It was a large, handsome place, furnished in the Empire style with mirrors framed in delicate white arabesques, and much gilding woven into the pattern. The carpet was a great purple expanse covered with laurel wreaths of darker purple. There was but little furniture in the big, beautiful place, but it was all airy, fantastic and perfect of its kind. There was a general air of repose, of size and comely proportion in this delightful room. Here, an old French clock clicked merrily, there were two or three inlaid cabinets, and upon the walls were a few copies of some of Watteau's delightful scenes in the old courtly gardens of Versailles. Marjorie wore a long tea-gown, and she was sitting quite alone in the brilliantly lit place, with a book in her hand. The book was in her hand indeed, but she was not reading it. Her eyes were fixed upon the opposite wall, though they saw nothing there. Her thoughts were busy and her face was pale. She had recovered from her swoon in a minute or two, and found her mother fussing round her and her lover generally skilful in doing all that was necessary. And a short time afterwards she had driven home with Lady Poole. What she had heard, the very strain of hearing and being so intensely interested in it, had taken her strength away. Then had come the words when Sir William told her that the very thoughts that she was thinking at that moment were being in some mysterious way recorded and known. And she knew that she had been thinking of another man, thinking of him as an engaged girl should never think. 
Thought: "Everything you are thinking is being definitely recorded" suggests this story is about mind-reading technology, set in a world where thoughts are no longer private.  indicates science fiction. "Lady Poole" and "barrister-at-law" evoke some historical era. This blend of futuristic concepts with historical elements makes this most likely an example of science fiction.
Output: science fiction

Example 2:
Text: " "This gentleman?" asked the policeman, pointing to Gilbert. "Yes." "And these are the private apartments of your partner, Mr. Cooper Silwood?" "Yes." "And the dead body of Mr. Thornton, your friend, is found in the private apartments of your partner, Mr. Silwood?" "Yes." "And Mr. Silwood is dead?" "Yes." "Most extraordinary thing I ever heard of!" exclaimed the policeman. "There's something very strange here." "My father, as you can see for yourself," interposed Gilbert, "is ill; he is in no fit state to stay here a moment longer than is necessary. But if I can help you, I shall be glad to do so." "Mr. Eversleigh ought to go home at once," said the doctor. "That is all right," said the policeman. "Do you report to Inspector Gale?" asked Gilbert of the policeman; "I know him very well." "Yes; I shall report to him. And in the mean time these chambers must be closed up and sealed. The inspector will no doubt come and examine everything in them. This is the usual procedure. And of course there will be a coroner's inquest. Nothing more can be done at present, I think. Please sir, do not touch the body," he added, speaking to the doctor, who was scrutinizing it carefully. "If I went to Scotland Yard, should I find the inspector in?" asked Gilbert. "You'll find him there at 2.30." "And there is nothing more that can be done just now?" "Nothing." Leaving Silwood's chambers in the charge of the policeman, who had now been reinforced by the arrival of two other constables, the two Eversleighs, the doctor, the locksmith, and the porter filed out of the chamber of mystery and death. As they entered the court of Stone Buildings, they saw that little knots of people had collected, who were discussing something that evidently was unusually interesting. The fact was that the porter, on his way for the doctor and the policeman, had let fall hints of what had been found. The Eversleighs were asked by some gentlemen of the long robe, whom they knew, what was the truth of the matter, and they put before them the bare facts. But the porter and the locksmith were not so reticent. 
Thought: "The dead body of Mr. Thornton" in someone's private apartments establishes a murder mystery at the center of the plot. This is aligned with the methodical questioning by the police and mentions of an "inspector" and "coroner's inquest", along with meticulous descriptions of time and space throughout the passage.
Output: detective and mystery stories

Example 3:
Text: The kid he's never been there afore, but Deafy tells him the well's only about a hundred feet from where they unpacked, so he moseys out into the dark lookin' for the well, his rope in one hand, the camp coffee pot in 'tother, the idee bein' to let the pot down into the well with the rope. "It were sure dark in them trees, and the kid he's a blunderin' and stumblin' along, a-cursin' the world by sections, when all to once he stepped off into fresh air, and the next thing he knows he's a standin' at the bottom of the well in about four or five feet of ice-cold water, and him a-still hangin' onto the rope and pot with a death grip. Took him about five minutes to git his breath and realize he done found the well all rightee, and then he sets up a squall like a trapped wildcat. He ain't forgot, neither, that Deafy ain't likely to hear him, the ole man bein' deafer than a rock; so after hollerin' a while and gittin' no results he stops it and begins cussin' jist to relieve his mind and help keep him from shakin' all his teeth outen his head account o' shiverin' so blamed hard. "Up on top Deafy he's busy startin' a fire and openin' up the packs gittin' ready to cook supper. The kid not bein' back with the water yit, and he bein' obliged to have water fer bread makin' purposes, Deafy finally decides the kid's gone and got hisself lost out there in the dark, and so he takes a _pasear_ out that a-way huntin' fer him. The ole man's a hollerin' and a trompin' through the cedars an' rocks, thinkin' more how much his wool's a-goin' to fetch than anything else, when he thinks he hears someone a-callin'. He turns to listen, gits a little more sound in his ears, takes a step or two in its direction, and, kerslop, he's into that there well hole, square on top of the young gent from 'ole Missou'. Say, the things them two fellers sed to each other, an' both at the same time, most cracked the walls of the hole." Dad wiped his eyes with the heel of his fat hand. 
Thought: Characters like "Deafy" and dialogue with expressions like "a-cursin' the world by sections", " a-way huntin' fer him", "he young gent from 'ole Missou'", etc. are typically associated with the Old West. The mishap at the well, described in a colloquial style, is typical of western tall tales, adding local color to the genre.
Output: western stories

Example 4:
Text: "Do any of these fit?" "Yes, the D key. The D key. It fits the four cells in this corner." I fumbled through until I had the key tagged D. I opened the cell with as few clinking noises as possible. "Come on," I said. "We've got to get out of here in a hurry." He slipped out and pushed the door shut behind him. We headed for the stairs and were almost there when I heard somebody coming up. Jimmy must have heard it, too, because he grabbed my arm and pulled me back. We flattened out as best we could. Talk about walking right into it! The policeman looked over at us and said, "What are you doing up here, Robards? Hey, you're not...." I stepped out and brought out one of the pistols. I said, "Easy now. If things go wrong for us, I have nothing to lose by shooting you. If you want to live, play it straight." He apparently believed me, because he put his hands where I could see them and shut up. I herded him into Jimmy's cell and let Jimmy do the honors with the loaded sock. We taped him up and while Jimmy was locking him in, I heard somebody in one of the cells behind me say, "Shut up, there," to somebody else. I turned and said, "Do you want to get shot?" The voice was collected. "No. No trouble here." "Do you want to be let out?" The voice was amused. "I don't think so. Thank you just the same." Jimmy finished and I asked, "Where is your signal? We have to have that." "In the basement with the rest of my gear." The signal was all we took. When we were three blocks away and on a dark side street, I handed Jimmy his gun and ammunition. As he took them, he said, "Tell me something, Mia. Would you really have shot him?" I said. "I couldn't have. I hadn't loaded my gun yet." * * * * * I led him through town following the back ways I'd worked out before. Somebody once said that good luck is no more nor less than careful preparation, and this time I meant to have good luck. I led Jimmy toward the Losel-selling district. 
Thought: While the plot revolves around a likely prison escape scenario with a gun fight, this passage features a mysterious "signal" and the protagonist's use of "the D key" and expressions like "Losel-selling" demonstrate a fusion of the historical and the futuristic, characteristic of the genre of science fiction.
Output: science fiction

Example 5:
Text: At that unfortunate time I happened into his office with a letter of introduction from his closest Chicago friend, Willis Howard, prince of good men, the man that made the Palmer House famous--yes. Now I had come out here, Miss Dunning--I almost said Miss Dicksie, because I hear it so much----" "I should be greatly set up to hear you call me Dicksie. And I have wondered a thousand times about your name. Dare I ask--_why_ do they call you Whispering Smith? You don't whisper." He laughed with abundance of good-humor. "That is a ridiculous accident, and it all came about when I lived in Chicago. Do you know anything about the infernal climate there? Well, in Chicago I used to lose my voice whenever I caught a cold--sometimes for weeks together. So they began calling me Whispering Smith, and I've never been able to shake the name. Odd, isn't it? But I came out to go into the real-estate business. I was looking for some gold-bearing farm lands where I could raise quartz, don't you know, and such things--yes. I don't mind telling you this, though I wouldn't tell it to everybody----" "Certainly not," assented Dicksie, drawing her skirt around to sit in closer confidence. "I wanted to get rich quick," murmured Whispering Smith, confidentially. "Almost criminal, wasn't it?" "I wanted to have evening clothes." "Yes." "And for once in my life two pairs of suspenders--a modest ambition, but a gnawing one. Would you believe it? Before I left Bucks's office he had hired me for a railroad man. When he asked me what I could do, and I admitted a little experience in handling real estate, he brought his fist down on the table and swore I should be his right-of-way man." "How about the mining?" Whispering Smith waved his hand in something of the proud manner in which Bucks could wave his presidential hand. "My business, Bucks said, need not interfere with that, not in the least; he said that I could do all the mining I wanted to, and I _have_ done all the mining I wanted to. But here is the singular thing that happened: I opened up my office and had nothing to do; they didn't seem to want any right of way just then. 
Thought: "Miss Dicksie", "Whispering Smith", etc. are nicknames typical of western characters. The discussion of becoming a "right-of-way man" for the railroad touches on a crucial aspect of western expansion, along with the character's initial desire to find "gold-bearing farm lands" which ties into the fortune-seeking theme. Those are all common in western stories.

Example 6:
Text: He considered for a moment and then he wrote. '_Tom Carringford sends his love to you._' "It shall go as if it were a little message flying out of space." He stopped and considered again. "I should like the Lakemans to know before I get there. I have telegraphed already to say that I start to-night; but if Lena's very ill, it looks rather cruel to burst upon them with news of happiness." "Must they be told at once?" Margaret asked. For some reason she dreaded their knowing. "Well, they've always been so kind to me." Almost mechanically he took up his pen and wrote: '_Margaret and I want you to know that we are engaged, but, of course, I start alone to-night. Kind love._--_Tom._' Margaret kept her lips closed, for she thought of the Lakemans with a dislike that was almost beyond her control, but she felt that her father's memories, no less than the fact that they were Tom's friends, demanded her silence. "Now then," he said, "that's all over. Where's your hat?" "Over there, on the floor," she answered, demurely, "upside down--my best hat." "Never mind, I'll give you a dozen new ones. Let's send off these things and go for an hour's drive in the fastest hansom we can find--just to calm us down a little. Then, suppose we come back and dine quietly here at seven. Mrs. Gilman will manage it. I shall have to fly at half-past." Tom reflected quickly that Great College Street was the best shelter for a quiet _tête-à-tête_. "Come along." He took her hand and ran with her down the narrow staircase. "I don't believe you know how fond I am of you, but you'll find out in time," he said, stopping half-way. "I do know," she answered, "and I love you--dreadfully." He looked at her and kissed her, then a happy thought struck him. "Mrs. Gilman," he called, boisterously, for there were no other people in the house, "I want to tell you," he said, when that good woman appeared, "that Miss Vincent and I are engaged." "Oh, Mr. Carringford!
Thought: This passage features many mentions of words like "love", "kiss" and "engage". The build-up to and explict announcement of "Margaret and I want you to know that we are engaged", along with the focus on the characters' emotions and the hurried nature of their courtship, suggest a classic love story.
Output: love stories

Example 7:
Text: Jack answered, slipping her arm through her younger sister's. "Still, having done your duty, don't you think that after all I may be allowed to use my own judgment in this decision? Suppose I happen to think that life just now is offering me a great and surprising opportunity! It is surprising for me to have been chosen for this distinction; I feel this as keenly as any one of my family or friends, knowing my deficiencies, can feel it! Now don't you think it's unfair to threaten me, Frieda, to threaten in the one way which you know hurts most, the loss of any part of your affection, if I cannot make up my mind to do what you think best for me, not what I may think best for myself? I have never in all our lives, Frieda, suggested that any act of yours could possibly make me care for you less." Frieda's voice wavered a little. "Yes, I know, Jack, but then I would never do anything so rash and so foolish as what you contemplate. To see your name in the newspapers, to know that people are everywhere discussing your private affairs, making up disagreeable stories about you if they wish, for you know you are unconventional, Jack, and sometimes do give people opportunities to misjudge you, well, I simply can't bear it. So come on, baby, let us go back home, I see we are in the way here. I apologize, Jack, for wasting your time and mine. I had some socks of Henry's I wished to darn, and I should have been much better employed, as I see you already have reached your decision. Well, Jack, I am sure something very unfortunate will come of any such decision; when you become a public character you will certainly never be the same person to me." Frieda had slipped her hand inside her little girl's and was about to move away when Jack's arms went round her and her gray eyes, filled with tears, gazed into Frieda's implacable blue ones. "Frieda, in spite of all your sweetness, don't you realize that you are rather hard sometimes? I wonder if life will ever teach you to be different?" Frieda's eyes wavered an instant. "I see nothing to be gained by discussing my weaknesses of character. So long as I satisfy my husband and child I can manage without your good opinion, especially now I know that my interest and my wishes have not the slightest effect upon you." 
Thought:  The phrase "use my own judgment in this decision" and Jack's defense of her unconventional choices reflect the frontier spirit of self-reliance often found in western stories. In this passge, personal independence and defying social expectations are common western themes.

Example 8:
Text: There was reason to believe that plenty was to be had on the island, which was of volcanic formation, and moreover the water of the brook, swollen by the recent rain, was stained as though with clay. As I neared the line of cliff and rocks that formed the central ridge or back-bone of the island, the course of the stream bent to the north, and the forest was interspersed with small open glades where the great butterflies floated across through the sunshine, the metallic satiny blue of their lustrous wings glancing in the light. A flock of parrots with green, red, and blue plumage were chattering and screaming noisily in the bordering trees, and an occasional little green lizard would dash along the fallen trunks or over the rocks like a flash of emerald light. In one of these glades I found a quantity of shrubs growing about ten feet high and loaded with berries about the size of pepper-corns. The outside of these berries seemed covered with a greenish white wax. The leaf was somewhat like the myrtle. A sample of this, and of several other varieties of vegetation which were strange to me, I gathered to take home for identification in my manual of botany. I may here state that this berry-bearing shrub turned out to be the wax myrtle (_Myrica cerifera_ of the botanists), and that the waxy coating of the berries was what is known as bay-berry tallow. This wax can be readily collected by boiling the drupes and skimming it off as it rises to the surface of the water; and a bushel of the berries will yield from four to five pounds of the wax, which can be employed to make excellent candles. Near the cliffs I came upon a fine bed of clay, and I was so delighted with this discovery that I immediately began casting about for means of transporting a good supply to my house. The bed was distant from the house, as nearly as I could judge, about two miles, and the labor of carrying such heavy material would be very great. The best plan would be to knock together a raft of dry wood and float the clay down stream as a cargo. Vines and creepers to serve as cordage to tie the dead wood together were abundant, nor did it take me long to collect the wood and fashion the raft. Indeed, the harder task proved to be the digging out of the tough clay, as the only implements I had for this purpose were pointed sticks. 
Thought: The discovery of "wax myrtle" and clay on an island, along with the narrator's excitement and immediate plans to transport resources, are all reminiscent of a classic adventure story. Also we see detailed observations of flora and fauna, and a focus on the resourcefulness protagonist in building a raft suggest adventure story.

Example 9:
Text: he asked by way of preface. “Sent him to the pest-house,” replied the landlord, resting his elbows on the counter and his chin in his hands, and staring dismally at the opposite wall. “Ah! Lord 'a' mercy on us! These be dreadful times!” “Dreadful enough!” said Sir Norman, sighing deeply, as he thought of his beautiful Leoline, a victim of the merciless pestilence. “Have there been many deaths here of the distemper?” “Twenty-five to-day!” groaned the man. “Lord! what will become of us?” “You seem rather disheartened,” said Sir Norman, pouring out a glass of wine and handing it to him. “Just drink this, and don't borrow trouble. They say sack is a sure specific against the plague.” Mine host drained the bumper, and wiped his mouth, with another hollow groan. “If I thought that, sir, I'd not be sober from one week's end to t'other; but I know well enough I will be in a plague-pit in less than a week. O Lord! have mercy on us!” “Amen!” said Sir Norman, impatiently. “If fear has not taken away your wits, my good sir, will you tell me what old ruin that is I saw a little above here as I rode up?” The man started from his trance of terror, and glanced, first at the fiery eyes in the corner, and then at Sir Norman, in evident trepidation of the question. “That ruin, sir? You must be a stranger in this place, surely, or you would not need to ask that question.” “Well, suppose I am a stranger? What then?” “Nothing, sir; only I thought everybody knew everything about that ruin.” “But I do not, you see? So fill your glass again, and while you are drinking it, just tell me what that everything comprises.” Again the landlord glanced fearfully at the fiery eyes in the corner, and again hesitated. “Well!” exclaimed Sir Norman, at once surprised and impatient at his taciturnity, “Can't you speak man? I want you to tell me all about it.” “There is nothing to tell, sir,” replied the host, goaded to desperation. “It is an old, deserted ruin that's been here ever since I remember; and that's all I know about it.” 
Thought: References to the "Sir Norman", "pest-house" and "distemper" establish a setting during a time of plague, and the historical nature is representative of adventure stories. The invocation to the Lord and the religious aspect of the characters, along with historical peril and unknown elements in spite of hardship ("“Lord! what will become of us?"), is typical of adventure stories. 
Output: adventure stories

Example 10:
Text: There was a letter. Hurriedly, he snatched it out and turned the address up; a miracle--it was from the girl. The street door darkened; McBirney looked up. The rector and the bishop were coming in, the others at their heels. He thrust the envelope into his pocket, his pulse beating distinctly faster, and turned to meet his guests. When at three o'clock he got back to his quarters, after an exciting meeting of an hour, after lunch at the rectory, after seeing the bishop off on the 2.45 to New York, he locked his door first, and then hurriedly drew out the letter lying all this time unread. He tore untidily at the flap, and with that suddenly he stopped, and the luminous eyes took on an odd, sarcastic expression. "What a fool!" he spoke, half aloud, and put the letter down and strolled across the room and gazed out of the window. "What an ass! I'm allowing myself to get personally interested in this case; or to imagine that I'm personally interested. Folly. The girl is nothing to me. I'll never see her again. I care about her as I would about anybody in trouble. And--that's all. This lunacy of restlessness over the situation has got--to--stop." He was firm with himself. He sat down at his table and wrote a business note before he touched the letter again; but he saw the letter out of the tail of his eye all the time and he knew his pulse was going harder as, finally, he lifted the torn envelope with elaborate carelessness, and drew out the sheets of writing. My dear Mr. McBirney [the girl began], did anybody ever tell a story about a big general who limbered up his artillery, if that's the thing they do, and shouted orders, and cracked whips and rattled wheels and went through evolutions, and finally, with thunder and energy, trained a huge Krupp gun--or something--on a chipmunk? If there is such a story, and you've heard it, doesn't it remind you of your last letter at me? Not to me, I mean _at_ me. It was a wonderful letter again, but when I got through I had a feeling that what I needed was not suicide--I do dare say the word, you see--but execution. Maybe shooting is too good for me. 
Thought: This passage highlights the protagonist's intense emotional reaction to receiving a letter from "the girl." His excitement upon seeing the letter and his intense internal monologue ("The girl is nothing to me") suggest developing romantic feelings. The vivid description of the protagonist's emotion before and after reading the letter, along with his self-loathing "What an ass! I'm allowing myself to get personally interested in this case," imply a romance that the character is trying to resist. Those are all common elements in love stories.
Output: love stories
