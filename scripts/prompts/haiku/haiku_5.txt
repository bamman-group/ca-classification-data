You are a helpful assistant classifying text into categories. You will be shown a text, and your task is to classify it as non-haiku, or haiku. English haiku is a poetic form adapted from Japanese haiku that emerged in English-language poetry in the early 20th century. Here are some defining features of the genre:

1. reliance on brevity and concision
2. use of a visual language that regularly juxtaposes concrete yet incongruous images
3. meaning that arises through this play of images in a way that is suggestive rather than deliberate or explicit
4. presentational rather than representational 
5. distinctive diction (e.g. "snow", "cold")
6. flexible adherence to syllabic patterns, could be free verse
7. hints of Orientalist aesthetic in modernist poetry

Here are several examples:

Example 1:
Text: OPUS 389

	One by one the lights 
Tinkle out along the crowd-spattered street, 
And with their sparks sting the night mad.
	
	And I long for that elder night 
Which once, lonely, dim, and secret, 
Came towering to watchers on Assyrian hilltops.

	Night that was darkness, night that held stars! 
Night that was vastness and terrible song!

	Now, like a desecration of paid dancers 
Pirouetting in spangles through halls of the burial of 
		kings,

The tinkle of lights hacks at the silence, 
Clicking the key in the lock of the world.

Output: non-haiku

Example 2:
Text: TO WINKY

Cat,
Cat,
What are you?
Son, through a thousand generations of
	the black leopards
Padding among the sprigs of young
	bamboo;
Descendant of many removals from the 
	white panthers
Who crouch by night under the loquat-
	trees?
You crouch under the orange begonias,
And your eyes are green
With the violence of murder,
Or half-closed and stealthy
Like your sheathed claws.
Slowly, slowly,
You rise and stretch 
In a glossiness of beautiful curves,
Of muscles fluctuating under black,
	glazed hair.

Cat, 
You are a strange creature.
You sit on your haunches
And yawn,
But when you leap
I can almost hear the whine
Of a released string,
And I look to see its flaccid shaking
In the place whence you sprang.

You carry your tail as a banner,
Slowly it passes my chair,
But when I look for you, you are on the
	table
Moving easily among the most delicate
	porcelains.
Your food is a matter of importance
And you are insistent on having
Your wants attended to,
And yet you will eat a bird and its
	feathers
Apparently without injury.

In the night, I hear you crying,
But if I try to find you
There are only the shadows of rhododen-
	dron leaves
Brushing the ground.
When you come in out of the rain,
All wet with your tail full of burrs,
You fawn upon me in coils and subtleties;
But once you are dry
You leave me with a gesture of incon-	
	ceivable impudence,
Conveyed by the vanishing quirk of your tail
As you slide through the open door.

You walk as a king scorning his subjects;
You flirt with me as a concubine in robes
	of silk.
Cat,
I am afraid of your poisonous beauty,
I have seen you torturing a mouse.
Yet when you lie purring in my lap
I forget everything but how soft you are,
And it is only when I feel your claws
	open upon my hand
That I remember - 
Remember a puma lying out on a branch
	above my head
Years ago.

Shall I choke you, Cat,
Or kiss you?
Really I do not know.

Example 3:
Text: CARBON-DIOXIDE

O master Americans,
so supreme over this and all ages
in lawfully bridging the chasm
between any two sums with the process,
indigenous and doubly divine,
of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division - 
I ask you, how is it, 
that the tiddle-diddle-doo breathed into yonder flute
by the trained carbon-dioxide
of yonder wandering tatterdemalion - 
how is it that,
whereas you sanction the barter of
hens for gold, pigs for gold, ducks for gold,
by tossing your clinkety-clink
to the merest squawk-squawk, oint-oint, quack-quack - 
that this tiddle-diddle-doo,
while it dosen't say in words
audible to the ear or legible to the eye - 
'will you drop me a penny for beauty?' - 
how is it, I say,
that that huckster of the flute,
who needs but an addition of oxygen
equal to a subtraction of carbon-dioxide,
lest he fall and beauty fall with him,
is thin as a worm and white as a shell?‚Äî
have you no process for pleasure,
or is pleasure unlawful among you?

Output: non-haiku

Example 4:
Text: AN INCIDENT

William Blake and Catherine Bourchier
	were married in the newly rebuilt
	Church of Battersea where the win-
	dows were beautifully painted to imi-
	tate real stained glass.
Pigments or crystal, what did it matter - 
	when Jehovah sat on a cloud of curled
	fire over the door-way,
And angels with silver trumpets played
	Hosannas under the wooden groins of
	the peaked roof!
William and Catherine Blake left the 
	painted windows behind in the newly
	rebuilt Church of Battersea,
But God and the angels went out with
	them;
And the angels played on their trumpets
	under the plaster ceiling of their 
	lodging,
Morning, and evening, and morning,
	forty-five round years.

Has the paint faded in the windows of
	Battersea Church, I wonder?

Example 5:
Text: THE POND

Cold, wet leaves
Floating on moss-coloured water,
And the croaking of frogs - 
Cracked bell-notes in the twilight.
