You are a helpful assistant classifying text into categories. You will be shown a text, and your task is to classify it as POS, or NEG. Narrativity refers to the degree to which a text exhibits narrative qualities. Here, it is considered as a scalar, multidimensional property of texts that is characterized by the presence of focalized, concrete agents performing actions situated at a temporal and spatial distance from the narrator. Here are some defining features of **positive** and **negative** narrativity:

**Positive Predictors**:
1. significant presence of animate entities or actors
2. significant presence of past tense verbs
3. concrete descriptions of time and actions

**Negative Predictors**:
1. significant presence of (abstract) nouns
2. significant presence of present participles
3. explicit references to thoughts and feelings

Here are several examples:

Example 1:
Text: Yet the imagination which announces itself in the poem's bold opening lines is from the beginning functioning in an intellectually associative fashion and recalling some texts rather than others because of their pertinence to the poem's thematic concerns. That much is clear enough from Keats's invocation of the classical tradition as he first describes the heartache occasioned by the music welling about him. Critics often remark that Keats makes nothing of the Philomela myth in "Ode to a Nightingale." Yet the nightingale's song is so profoundly associated with Philomela, and with Aedon's lament for Itylus, as to provide a faint backdrop for Keats's poem, at least, by reminding readers that "the beautiful mythology of Greece" (Preface to Endymion) includes stories of birdsong commemorating a human pain it cannot transmute. The pain summoned by Keats's other opening glances at the classical tradition lies similarly with the issue of death.
Output: NEG

Example 2:
Text: First she had to let the lump that was crowding her throat begin to dissolve, otherwise she knew that silent tears would begin to run down her face. She could only hope that Wilson would mistake her silence for shyness. Apparently he did. “Why don’t we take a look and see what you’ve come up with?” he suggested, gently. Zan swallowed hard, then managed to speak in an even tone.
Output: POS

Example 3:
Text: Away he went. There was something fascinating to her in him. For the moment he was nothing but a piece of swinging stuff; not a particle of him that did not swing. She could never lose herself so, nor could her brothers. It roused a warmth in her.
Output: POS

Example 4:
Text: With Fox and his two hundred reinforcements watching helplessly, South Carolina began bombarding Fort Sumter with heated cannonballs and Fort Moultrie with shots from forty-three guns and mortars. Thirty-six hours later, Major Anderson and his garrison at Sumter surrendered. The bombardment of Fort Sumter signified the beginning of the Civil War, though many people hoped reconciliation was still possible. Over the next few weeks, newspapers and politicians from both parties, including Seward, pressed Lincoln not to engage Southern forces. But Lincoln knew the die had been cast.
Output: POS

Example 5:
Text: Aunt Geoffrey seems to like to do things in her own way." "It must be very bad indeed if she cannot venture to wait for him!" said Mrs. Frederick Langford, much alarmed. "And never to tell you!" said Henrietta.
Output: POS

Now read the following text and classify it into one of the following categories: POS, or NEG. Your output should only contain the name of the predicted class. Do NOT make up additional classes.
