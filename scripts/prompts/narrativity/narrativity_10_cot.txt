You are a helpful assistant classifying text into categories. You will be shown a text, and your task is to classify it as POS, or NEG. Narrativity refers to the degree to which a text exhibits narrative qualities. Here, it is considered as a scalar, multidimensional property of texts that is characterized by the presence of focalized, concrete agents performing actions situated at a temporal and spatial distance from the narrator. Here are some defining features of **positive** and **negative** narrativity:

**Positive Predictors**:
1. significant presence of animate entities or actors
2. significant presence of past tense verbs
3. concrete descriptions of time and actions

**Negative Predictors**:
1. significant presence of (abstract) nouns
2. significant presence of present participles
3. explicit references to thoughts and feelings

Please format your response in two lines:

Thought: <your explanation goes here>
Output: POS, or NEG

Here are several examples:

Example 1:
Text: Yet the imagination which announces itself in the poem's bold opening lines is from the beginning functioning in an intellectually associative fashion and recalling some texts rather than others because of their pertinence to the poem's thematic concerns. That much is clear enough from Keats's invocation of the classical tradition as he first describes the heartache occasioned by the music welling about him. Critics often remark that Keats makes nothing of the Philomela myth in "Ode to a Nightingale." Yet the nightingale's song is so profoundly associated with Philomela, and with Aedon's lament for Itylus, as to provide a faint backdrop for Keats's poem, at least, by reminding readers that "the beautiful mythology of Greece" (Preface to Endymion) includes stories of birdsong commemorating a human pain it cannot transmute. The pain summoned by Keats's other opening glances at the classical tradition lies similarly with the issue of death.
Thought: This passage deals with the intellectual and thematic content of a poem ("functioning in an intellectually associative fashion", "recalling some texts rather than others because of their pertinence to the poem's thematic concerns", etc.). It lacks concrete actions or events, and it focuses instead on abstract literary analysis and references to a major author ("Keats") and classical mythology. Overall, this reads more like a piece of literary criticism. The absence of animate agents performing actions and the heavy use of abstract nouns support the label of NEG narrativity. This is an example of negative narrativity (NEG).
Output: NEG

Example 2:
Text: First she had to let the lump that was crowding her throat begin to dissolve, otherwise she knew that silent tears would begin to run down her face. She could only hope that Wilson would mistake her silence for shyness. Apparently he did. “Why don’t we take a look and see what you’ve come up with?” he suggested, gently. Zan swallowed hard, then managed to speak in an even tone.
Thought: This passage is focused on concrete actions and emotions experienced by the characters involved, such as "let the lump that was crowding her throat begin to dissolve" and "silent tears would begin to run down her face." It describes the protagonist's internal struggle and physical reactions, as well as the interaction with another character, Wilson. These elements of action, emotion, and interaction contribute to a high degree of narrativity. This is an example of positive narrativity (POS).
Output: POS

Example 3:
Text: Away he went. There was something fascinating to her in him. For the moment he was nothing but a piece of swinging stuff; not a particle of him that did not swing. She could never lose herself so, nor could her brothers. It roused a warmth in her.
Thought: This passage describes a character's actions and the emotional response they evoke in another character, as seen in such phrases as "Away he went" and "not a particle of him that did not swing". It highlights the character's movement and the fascination and warmth it stirs in the observer. These concrete actions and emotional responses are indicative of positive narrativity. As such, this is an example of positive narrativity (POS).
Output: POS

Example 4:
Text: With Fox and his two hundred reinforcements watching helplessly, South Carolina began bombarding Fort Sumter with heated cannonballs and Fort Moultrie with shots from forty-three guns and mortars. Thirty-six hours later, Major Anderson and his garrison at Sumter surrendered. The bombardment of Fort Sumter signified the beginning of the Civil War, though many people hoped reconciliation was still possible. Over the next few weeks, newspapers and politicians from both parties, including Seward, pressed Lincoln not to engage Southern forces. But Lincoln knew the die had been cast.
Thought: This passage describes specific actions and events, such as "South Carolina began bombarding Fort Sumter" and "Major Anderson and his garrison at Sumter surrendered." It also includes a clear temporal sequence of events and the responses of various parties. These elements of concrete actions, historical events, and the unfolding sequence contribute to positive narrativity. This is an example of positive narrativity (POS).
Output: POS

Example 5:
Text: Aunt Geoffrey seems to like to do things in her own way." "It must be very bad indeed if she cannot venture to wait for him!" said Mrs. Frederick Langford, much alarmed. "And never to tell you!" said Henrietta.
Thought: This passage is focused on the dialogue and emotional reactions of the characters (e.g. "It must be very bad indeed", "much alarmed", etc.). It describes the characters' concerns and interactions, which are indicative of a narrative involving personal dynamics and responses. These elements of direct speech and emotional reactions all signal positive narrativity. This is an example of positive narrativity (POS).
Output: POS

Example 6:
Text: . . Maratua and Sangalaki," observed Syafruddin Pernyata, a poet, essayist, and fiction writer, naming some of East Kalimantan’s landmark sites. "In my opinion, writers have a sort of nascent duty to tell people about them" 'Indonesia itu bukan hanya Jawa, bukan hanya Borobudur, bukan hanya Bromo, bukan hanya Monas di Jakarta . .
Thought: This passage contains a quote by Syafruddin Pernyata about the duty of writers. It lacks concrete actions or events and focuses instead on abstract nouns (occupations and geographical references). The absence of animate agents performing actions and the emphasis on intellectual commentary indicate the label of negative narrativity. This is an example of negative narrativity (NEG).
Output: NEG

Example 7:
Text: CONSULTANT warrants that such employees shall be informed of the proprietary nature of the Proprietary Information and shall be bound by this Agreement in the same manner that CONSULTANT is bound. 5.3 No Licenses. No rights or licenses in or to the Proprietary Information of REIT are granted to CONSULTANT by virtue of this Agreement. Intellectual Property, Inventions and Patents.

Thought: This passage is focused on legal and contractual obligations; it's filled with legalese ("proprietary nature of the Proprietary Information", "rights or licenses in or to the Proprietary Information", etc.). It lacks narrative elements -- no concrete actions, events, or emotional responses. It is primarily concerned with intellectual property and legal terms. This is an example of negative narrativity (NEG).
Output: NEG

Example 8:
Text: 13.1   The Parties acknowledge that the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act,        S.C. 1992, c.34, as amended from time to time (hereinafter referred        to as the "TDGA") prohibits transportation of any explosive, dangerous         or destructive substance, or anything likely to injure or damage property        or persons (hereinafter referred to as "Dangerous Goods") unless the        requirements of the TDGA are met. The Parties agree that they only intend        for Dangerous Goods to be carried pursuant to this Agreement if the        requirements of the TDGA are met and both Parties are aware that such        goods are being carried. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties agree        that neither Dynamex nor Purolator shall be under any obligation or duty        whatsoever to open for prior inspection any Freight tendered to Dynamex        pursuant to this Agreement. Neither Party shall be responsible for any        losses or damage whatsoever that may be sustained by the other Party, its        directors, officers, employees and any persons for whom it may become        responsible in law, as a result of any Dangerous Goods contained in        Freight unless such Party had actual prior knowledge of the presence of        Dangerous Goods. In the event a Party had actual prior knowledge of the        presence of Dangerous Goods, then it shall be liable for loss or damage        to the other Party if it would otherwise be liable under this Agreement        or at law.
Thought: This passage is filled with legalese regarding the transportation of dangerous goods ("prohibits transportation of any explosive, dangerous or destructive substance", "requirements of the TDGA are met", etc.).  It lacks narrative elements -- no concrete actions, events, or emotional responses; instead, it is concerned with legal obligations and responsibilities. This is an example of negative narrativity (NEG).
Output: NEG

Example 9:
Text: She’d have to skip it. There probably wasn’t much she could use, anyway. At the last second she took the rose off her dresser, the one Bishop had made her from metal and wire. It would be good luck. She hefted the blanket in her arms, now heavy with all the clothing and shoes it contained, and shuffled sideways out of the bedroom door.
Thought: This passage describes specific actions and decisions made by a character ("she took the rose off her dresser", "shuffled sideways out of the bedroom door", etc.). It includes concrete actions and physical objects, such as the rose and the blanket filled with clothing and shoes.. These elements of action and concrete details suggest positive narrativity. For those reasons, this is an example of positive narrativity (POS).
Output: POS

Example 10:
Text: No SWAT team. So far so good. The lights got brighter as the car got closer. Half a mile out he figured it was a Crown Victoria. A government car.
Thought: This passage describes specific actions and observations: e.g. "The lights got brighter as the car got closer", "he figured it was a Crown Victoria", etc. It includes concrete details and a sense of narrative arc that culminates in the evocative immage of "a government car". This is an example of positive narrativity (POS).
Output: POS
