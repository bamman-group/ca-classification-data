You are a helpful assistant classifying text into categories. You will be shown a text, and your task is to classify it as recalled, imagined, or retold. Recalled stories are written about a memorable or salietn event that happened to the author in the past 6 months.
Imagined stories are fictional and did not actually happen to the author.
Retold stories are based on a story that the author has told before, 2-3 months in the past.


Here are several examples:

Example 1:
Text: I decided to sell my house after Christmas and had a heck of a time. You wouldn't believe it! First, I couldn't decide whether to sell as-is, get it painted and repaired, sell it myself, or get a realtor -- in any combination thereof. So I was running all those possibilites at once! The first obstacle I ran into was that I couldn't find any contractors to do the painting and repair work. I mean, I was ghosted by three contractors who never showed up to give a bid! The economy must be great, right!?I thought about selling as is to one of those "we buy houses" people. That guy bullshitted me that the house was virtually unsellable because of size and location, and uninsurable as well. He offered me about half value. No thanks! I was sweating bullets about getting the repairs and painting done. I wanted -- needed -- to get the house ready and leave town quickly. I talked to one friend who was out of work but gone for the holidays about helping me when he got back, for pay. Another friend volunteered to come in from out of state and help for free. Botdh those options meant delay and doing work I really don't like to do. After two weeks of setting up all options -- after all, I didn't know what was going to pain out -- I found a contractor who did the work for a reasonable price in a week. Then a realtor had it under contract in another week. Phew! So stressful! I never want to own another house. As Thoreau said about farms, I'll apply to all real estate: It's more easily aquired than got rid of!

Example 2:
Text: Today started like any other day. I went through my usual morning routine and generally everything was normal. What I didn't expect was that today I will be one of my favorite days in recent memory. The reason being that I will hit a personal record while bench pressing and finally have a sense of validation for my hard work. Even when my workout started, there was no evidence that anything was different. To be honest, getting in the gym has been rough of late. It seems like my lifts have plateaued. I'm not seeing the results that I wish I was getting. I feel like I am giving maximum effort, but I guess it just hasn't been enough. That is, until today. As I got under the bar to bench press, I could start to feel the weight felt lighter than usual. I warmed up like normal, but as the lifts got heavier and heavier, I wasn't struggling as much as usual. I figured now was as good a day as any to try and set a personal best. I put on the 200 lbs and went for it. To my surprise I was able to get this up for 5 reps! A personal best and goal of mine. My hard work feels validated by these results. I hope I can continue to get stronger!

Example 3:
Text: I have spent my life trying to overcome low self-esteem. Everyone has something that is a challenge, for me it is having divorced parents with very strong and very different world views. My Mom always accepted me, but my Dad never did. We have tried on and off for years to reconnect. It never seems to keep us talking. So we are ALWAYS KIND OF ESTRANGED, but Dad and I had totally stopped trying a while ago, and then my Step-Mom wanted to give me some furniture last Spring and they came out to see us last April. I was really eager to play guitar for my Dad, and his response was pretty meh.     The surprising thing that happened was my son's visit. My oldest later went to visit my Dad and learned that my Dad wanted to learn to finger pick  after hearing me play, which is high praise coming from my old man. And for a while I felt better because it felt like approval. But since  then, only silence from my Dad. No emails to me or my other 5 kids. My Step-Mom remembers their Birthdays, and even signs cards fro my Dad.       So a few months later I am feeling like I remember more from my childhood, when my Dad was a happier more loving guy, and I felt loved. It hurts more now though, like I had a nearly healed sunburn and that encouraged me to go out and lie in the sun, and now it's almost a medical condition and really stings.     Like hope is dangerous, and acceptance is key.

Text: The event that just happened was my daughter's wedding. The wedding was in june. We had so much fun planning for the wedding.  Her dress was beautiful and she looked gorgeous. The groom looked very handsome as did the entire wedding party. First was the church ceremony then was the reception. The appetizers and meal was delicious. There was A choice of chicken, meat, or fish. The wedding cake was beautiful. It was a 5 tier wedding cake. It had a beautiful topping of crystal doves. There was lots of music and dancing. She was very happy which made me happy and very proud. I will never forget such a beautiful day. We are constantly looking back at the pictures.

Example 5:
Text: We met in a coffee shop.  I was behind her in line.  She had the most beautiful red hair flowing down her back.  She was ordering a mocha latte, which happens to be my favorite.  As she was turning around from the counter she bumped into me.  She looked up at me and blushed.  My heart burst.  She had such an easy smile, and porcelain skin.  She apologized and I said I would forgive her if she would just come join me with her latte.  She agreed, and we had the most interesting conversation, which led to us making a date for dinner that same week.  It became obviously that we were both very interested in the other and we have been inseparable since.  Her spirit is a beautiful as she is on the outside.  My family adores her and her family loves me as well.  Even though it seems a bit rushed to most outsiders, we plan to be married in the spring.  Sometimes you just know what's right by how it feels.  We can't wait any longer to continue our lives together as husband and wife.

Example 6:
Text: I took a brand new job doing marketing for this small clothing line a few months ago. I had other offers that actually paid more money. I took this one because it paid less but had more opportunity for growth. The owners are this really nice little couple from Texas. They seemed very very sweet. I enjoyed their pitch to me about what the chances were of success and how poised they were to pay ore in the future pending it all went well. I liked this a lot and their energy. I was happy to meet them and I thought about it long and hard. After a few days I decided to take it. When I started a week later I realized what a mess things were in terms of strategy. I had this idea of starting a new product line. A series of denim jackets for men women and children. We searched for a long time for supplies and places that could help us with it. We found  a great one and managed to have some prototypes made. We sold them locally at first and they were a hit. We then launched them via our website and this product alone has single-handedly turned this business around. I am happy that it all worked out.

Example 7:
Text: I still can't believe the situation I got involved with on the way home from work that day.  It was a really long day at work, with an early afternoon meeting that stretched well past dinner time.  By the time I was leaving work, I was physically and emotionally worn out on top of being very hungry.  I have a long commute home, it was raining, and I heard that traffic was particularly heavy for that time of night.  I decided to drive straight home and eat dinner at home instead of stopping.  As I entered the highway, the rain had started to come down almost torrentially, it was really difficult to see.  Immediately, I could tell that the driver in front of me was struggling.  She was going very slowly and seemed to be riding the white line.  As we neared where the traffic was supposed to pick up, she twice nearly drove off the side of the road.  I was worried about her, but also about my safety because her driving was unpredictable.  I wanted to pass her at my first opportunity, but I slowed down and gave myself some room in the meantime.  Once I could see the red brake lights from the traffic jam in front of us, I started to feel a little better because I knew the driver in front of me would have to stop and the traffic jam would keep her safe for a while.  I couldn't believe it when, just before we reached the traffic jame, she suddenly sped up and took a hard right turn right off the road and into the woods.  I swear I could hear her scream from the woods as I drove by.  I never saw myself as someone who would stopped to help in this situation, but something came over me and I just pulled over without thinking.  I ran into the woods and the scene was horrible.  The driver was an elderly woman and her small car was upside down and crunched really badly.  She was screaming in pain and I could tell she was really bloody.  I quickly called 911 and broke down the scene before I took a real hard look into the car.  The woman was in rough condition, couldn't move because the car was upside down, and she seemed absolutely terrified.  I knew I couldn't really help her, but my heart was breaking for her.  I laid down on the ground and held the woman's hand.  I tried to talk calmly with her until the ambulance and rescue workers came.  She begged to hold my hand again after she was removed.  I ended up riding with her in the ambulance until we got her to the hospital and she was sedated.

Example 8:
Text: Today is Thursday. I canâ€™t believe itâ€™s been one week since all of the drama with my neighbor went down. I canâ€™t really understand how a women with such a great career and future ahead of her could stoop so low. I doubt she thought the truth would get out. An affair with a fairly new hire at her business, come on! Not to mention the thievery they committed together. They nearly stole millions of dollars from her company. I canâ€™t help but think this man came into the picture before getting hired by her. A heist this big had to have been planned for months. She totally took advantage of her managerial position and intentionally hired this guy to make their plan work. Honestly, how did they figure they wouldnâ€™t get caught?!   Now her children and her husband have to deal with the shame. Their name is all over the paper and the news. How could she compromise their well-being and peace for her own selfish gain...itâ€™s sickening. Iâ€™m glad somebody caught on and told on them. The nerve she had to lie right to the police officers face!  I really canâ€™t fathom how her poor family must be feeling.
Output: imagined

Example 9:
Text: I was surprised by birthday gift that my husband gave me this year. My husband bought me a car eight months ago as a birthday gift. He did it secretly and I totally had no idea of what he was going to buy me as a birthday gift. On my birthday, he took me to a car dealer. He told me that we were going to try new cars. When we got to the car dealer, we tried several new cars and I was very excited because I really needed a new car since I lost my old car during a car accident not long before. When I got out of a Hyundai car, my husband handed me a car key. I guessed he bought me a new car! Though he did not say a word, I was totally shocked that my husband bought me a new car secretly. He bought me a Hyundai hatchback which was very nice. I especially loved the sunset orange color which was so cute. I was impressed by the materials used by Hyundai which had improved and their look was very modern. I also liked the back-up camera, front and side collision warning, hatchback and audio bluetooth functions.  I hugged my husband at the car dealer because I was so thrilled and touched by his behavior. The new car was very important to me because my beloved old car got totaled during a car accident earlier. This event was very memorable.

Example 10:
Text: Well, unfortunately this event happened to me a few months ago and it will always be with me.  It's not a happy tale.  But it is memorable for it was the day my beloved dog died.  I was doing everything I could for him.  Yet, his 20 year old body just didn't want to go on.  It couldn't defy time I guess.  I carried his emaciated body to the tub to wash him a few times a day.  I fed him through a syringe a few times each day.  I gave him intravenous fluids.  I gave him supplements.  At times he'd seem to come back to life a bit.  To be his former self.  The dog I'd spent more than half my life with, through ups and down and everything.  How could my rock, my best friend ever, be leaving me like this?  What could I have done differently?  I made him the best meals I could, taking time for each and every ingredient to cook just right for him.  I cuddled him and loved him all I could for years.  I went everywhere with him.  You don't just leave somebody you're so connected to like that.  You don't just get sick one day and stoop eating.  Just before the moment of his passing, I went to give him his lunch.  As he took his last breath, I sat there helpless.  Part of my soul, gone forever.  One never forgets one's soul.
