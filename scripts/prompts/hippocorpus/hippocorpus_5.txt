You are a helpful assistant classifying text into categories. You will be shown a text, and your task is to classify it as recalled, imagined, or retold. Recalled stories are written about a memorable or salietn event that happened to the author in the past 6 months.
Imagined stories are fictional and did not actually happen to the author.
Retold stories are based on a story that the author has told before, 2-3 months in the past.


Here are several examples:

Example 1:
Text: I decided to sell my house after Christmas and had a heck of a time. You wouldn't believe it! First, I couldn't decide whether to sell as-is, get it painted and repaired, sell it myself, or get a realtor -- in any combination thereof. So I was running all those possibilites at once! The first obstacle I ran into was that I couldn't find any contractors to do the painting and repair work. I mean, I was ghosted by three contractors who never showed up to give a bid! The economy must be great, right!?I thought about selling as is to one of those "we buy houses" people. That guy bullshitted me that the house was virtually unsellable because of size and location, and uninsurable as well. He offered me about half value. No thanks! I was sweating bullets about getting the repairs and painting done. I wanted -- needed -- to get the house ready and leave town quickly. I talked to one friend who was out of work but gone for the holidays about helping me when he got back, for pay. Another friend volunteered to come in from out of state and help for free. Botdh those options meant delay and doing work I really don't like to do. After two weeks of setting up all options -- after all, I didn't know what was going to pain out -- I found a contractor who did the work for a reasonable price in a week. Then a realtor had it under contract in another week. Phew! So stressful! I never want to own another house. As Thoreau said about farms, I'll apply to all real estate: It's more easily aquired than got rid of!
Output: recalled

Example 2:
Text: Today started like any other day. I went through my usual morning routine and generally everything was normal. What I didn't expect was that today I will be one of my favorite days in recent memory. The reason being that I will hit a personal record while bench pressing and finally have a sense of validation for my hard work. Even when my workout started, there was no evidence that anything was different. To be honest, getting in the gym has been rough of late. It seems like my lifts have plateaued. I'm not seeing the results that I wish I was getting. I feel like I am giving maximum effort, but I guess it just hasn't been enough. That is, until today. As I got under the bar to bench press, I could start to feel the weight felt lighter than usual. I warmed up like normal, but as the lifts got heavier and heavier, I wasn't struggling as much as usual. I figured now was as good a day as any to try and set a personal best. I put on the 200 lbs and went for it. To my surprise I was able to get this up for 5 reps! A personal best and goal of mine. My hard work feels validated by these results. I hope I can continue to get stronger!

Example 3:
Text: I have spent my life trying to overcome low self-esteem. Everyone has something that is a challenge, for me it is having divorced parents with very strong and very different world views. My Mom always accepted me, but my Dad never did. We have tried on and off for years to reconnect. It never seems to keep us talking. So we are ALWAYS KIND OF ESTRANGED, but Dad and I had totally stopped trying a while ago, and then my Step-Mom wanted to give me some furniture last Spring and they came out to see us last April. I was really eager to play guitar for my Dad, and his response was pretty meh.     The surprising thing that happened was my son's visit. My oldest later went to visit my Dad and learned that my Dad wanted to learn to finger pick  after hearing me play, which is high praise coming from my old man. And for a while I felt better because it felt like approval. But since  then, only silence from my Dad. No emails to me or my other 5 kids. My Step-Mom remembers their Birthdays, and even signs cards fro my Dad.       So a few months later I am feeling like I remember more from my childhood, when my Dad was a happier more loving guy, and I felt loved. It hurts more now though, like I had a nearly healed sunburn and that encouraged me to go out and lie in the sun, and now it's almost a medical condition and really stings.     Like hope is dangerous, and acceptance is key.

Example 4:

The groom looked very handsome as did the entire wedding party. First was the church ceremony then was the reception. The appetizers and meal was delicious. There was A choice of chicken, meat, or fish. The wedding cake was beautiful. It was a 5 tier wedding cake. It had a beautiful topping of crystal doves. There was lots of music and dancing. She was very happy which made me happy and very proud. I will never forget such a beautiful day. We are constantly looking back at the pictures.
Output: recalled

Example 5:
Text: We met in a coffee shop.  I was behind her in line.  She had the most beautiful red hair flowing down her back.  She was ordering a mocha latte, which happens to be my favorite.  As she was turning around from the counter she bumped into me.  She looked up at me and blushed.  My heart burst.  She had such an easy smile, and porcelain skin.  She apologized and I said I would forgive her if she would just come join me with her latte.  She agreed, and we had the most interesting conversation, which led to us making a date for dinner that same week.  It became obviously that we were both very interested in the other and we have been inseparable since.  Her spirit is a beautiful as she is on the outside.  My family adores her and her family loves me as well.  Even though it seems a bit rushed to most outsiders, we plan to be married in the spring.  Sometimes you just know what's right by how it feels.  We can't wait any longer to continue our lives together as husband and wife.
