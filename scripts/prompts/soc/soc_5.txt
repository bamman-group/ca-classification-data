You are a helpful assistant classifying text into categories. You will be shown a text, and your task is to classify it as Realism or SOC. "SOC", or Stream of Consciousness, is a style of narration that is defined by interior monologue, soliloquy, free indirect discourse, free association, imagery and symbols, irregular punctuation, fragmented sentences, ellipses, paratactical paragraphs, discontinuous syntax, onomatopoeia, sensory perception, lexical opaqueness, and/or lexical bombardment. "Realism" is defined as the absence of SOC.

Here are several examples:

Example 1:
Text: Next he sought Ben Rogers; he had gone fishing. Presently he stumbled upon Huck Finn the Red-Handed. Huck would answer. Tom took him to a private place and opened the matter to him confidentially. Huck was willing. Huck was always willing to take a hand in any enterprise that offered entertainment and required no capital, for he had a troublesome superabundance of that sort of time which is not money. “Where'll we dig?” said Huck. “Oh, most anywhere.” “Why, is it hid all around?” “No, indeed it ain't. It's hid in mighty particular places, Huck--sometimes on islands, sometimes in rotten chests under the end of a limb of an old dead tree, just where the shadow falls at midnight; but mostly under the floor in ha'nted houses.” “Who hides it?”
Output: Realism

Example 2:
Text: It was a new feeling Herman now had inside him that made him feel he was strong to make a struggle. It was new for Herman Kreder really to be wanting something, but Herman wanted strongly now to be a father, and he wanted badly that his baby should be a boy and healthy. Herman never had cared really very much about his father and his mother, though always, all his life, he had done everything just as they wanted, and he had never really cared much about his wife, Lena, though he always had been very good to her, and had always tried to keep his mother off her, with the awful way she always scolded, but to be really a father of a little baby, that feeling took hold of Herman very deeply. He was almost ready, so as to save his baby from all trouble, to really make a strong struggle with his mother and with his father, too, if he would not help him to control his mother.
Output: SOC

Example 3:
Text: He drew a sigh of relief as he looked at the two girls. "If," said he, "I had only had a musket I would not have run, but Mr. Holbrook and Caleb and Benjamin went hunting this morning, and they carried all the muskets, and I had nothing except this knife." With that the boy brandished a wicked-looking knife. "You might have done something with that," remarked Great-great-grandmother Letitia, and her voice was somewhat scornful. "Yes, something," agreed the boy. "It is a good knife. My father killed a big Injun and took it only last week. It is a scalping knife." "Do you mean to say," asked the great-great-grandmother Letitia, "that you don't know enough to use that knife, great boy that you are?" The boy straightened himself. He saw the other Letitia and his blue eyes were full of admiration and bravery. "Of course I know how," said he. "Haven't I killed ten wolves and aren't their heads nailed to the outside of the meeting-house?" Letitia was quite sure that the boy lied, but she knew that he lied to please her, and she liked him for it. Great-great-grandmother Letitia sniffed. "You are the greatest braggart in the Precinct," said she. "Nary a wolf have you killed, and you ran because you heard a wild cat or a bear.
Output: Realism

Example 4:
Text: Joe, you stay near me and buy when I tell you.” The secretary of the board appeared on his little platform. “E. W. Clark & Company,” he announced, at one-thirty, “have just closed their doors.” “Tighe & Company,” he called at one-forty-five, “announce that they are compelled to suspend.” “The First National Bank of Philadelphia,” he called, at two o’clock, “begs to state that it cannot at present meet its obligations.” After each announcement, always, as in the past, when the gong had compelled silence, the crowd broke into an ominous “Aw, aw, aw.” “Tighe & Company,” thought Cowperwood, for a single second, when he heard it. “There’s an end of him.” And then he returned to his task. When the time for closing came, his coat torn, his collar twisted loose, his necktie ripped, his hat lost, he emerged sane, quiet, steady-mannered. “Well, Ed,” he inquired, meeting his brother, “how’d you make out?” The latter was equally torn, scratched, exhausted. “Christ,” he replied, tugging at his sleeves, “I never saw such a place as this. They almost tore my clothes off.”
Output: Realism

Example 5:
Text: While the Civil War went on she was still a very young girl; but she passed months of this long period in a state of almost passionate excitement, in which she felt herself at times (to her extreme confusion) stirred almost indiscriminately by the valour of either army. Of course the circumspection of suspicious swains had never gone the length of making her a social proscript; for the number of those whose hearts, as they approached her, beat only just fast enough to remind them they had heads as well, had kept her unacquainted with the supreme disciplines of her sex and age. She had had everything a girl could have: kindness, admiration, bonbons, bouquets, the sense of exclusion from none of the privileges of the world she lived in, abundant opportunity  for dancing, plenty of new dresses, the London Spectator, the latest publications, the music of Gounod, the poetry of Browning, the prose of George Eliot. These things now, as memory played over them, resolved themselves into a multitude of scenes and figures. Forgotten things came back to her; many others, which she had lately thought of great moment, dropped out of sight. The result was kaleidoscopic, but the movement of the instrument was checked at last by the servant's coming in with the name of a gentleman.
Output: SOC

Now read the following text and classify it into one of the following categories: Realism or SOC. Your output should only contain the name of the predicted class. Do NOT make up additional classes.
