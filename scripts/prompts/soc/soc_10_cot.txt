You are a helpful assistant classifying text into categories. You will be shown a text, and your task is to classify it as Realism or SOC. "SOC", or Stream of Consciousness, is a style of narration that is defined by interior monologue, soliloquy, free indirect discourse, free association, imagery and symbols, irregular punctuation, fragmented sentences, ellipses, paratactical paragraphs, discontinuous syntax, onomatopoeia, sensory perception, lexical opaqueness, and/or lexical bombardment. "Realism" is defined as the absence of SOC.

Please format your response in two lines:

Thought: <your explanation goes here>
Output: Realism or SOC

Here are several examples:

Example 1:
Text: Next he sought Ben Rogers; he had gone fishing. Presently he stumbled upon Huck Finn the Red-Handed. Huck would answer. Tom took him to a private place and opened the matter to him confidentially. Huck was willing. Huck was always willing to take a hand in any enterprise that offered entertainment and required no capital, for he had a troublesome superabundance of that sort of time which is not money. “Where'll we dig?” said Huck. “Oh, most anywhere.” “Why, is it hid all around?” “No, indeed it ain't. It's hid in mighty particular places, Huck--sometimes on islands, sometimes in rotten chests under the end of a limb of an old dead tree, just where the shadow falls at midnight; but mostly under the floor in ha'nted houses.” “Who hides it?”
Thought: This text depicts realism in that it describes concrete, actively occurring actions and dialogue.
Output: Realism

Example 2:
Text: It was a new feeling Herman now had inside him that made him feel he was strong to make a struggle. It was new for Herman Kreder really to be wanting something, but Herman wanted strongly now to be a father, and he wanted badly that his baby should be a boy and healthy. Herman never had cared really very much about his father and his mother, though always, all his life, he had done everything just as they wanted, and he had never really cared much about his wife, Lena, though he always had been very good to her, and had always tried to keep his mother off her, with the awful way she always scolded, but to be really a father of a little baby, that feeling took hold of Herman very deeply. He was almost ready, so as to save his baby from all trouble, to really make a strong struggle with his mother and with his father, too, if he would not help him to control his mother.
Thought: This text involves SOC because it reveals the internal thoughts and feelings of a character, Herman, in long, winding sentences.
Output: SOC

Example 3:
Text: He drew a sigh of relief as he looked at the two girls. "If," said he, "I had only had a musket I would not have run, but Mr. Holbrook and Caleb and Benjamin went hunting this morning, and they carried all the muskets, and I had nothing except this knife." With that the boy brandished a wicked-looking knife. "You might have done something with that," remarked Great-great-grandmother Letitia, and her voice was somewhat scornful. "Yes, something," agreed the boy. "It is a good knife. My father killed a big Injun and took it only last week. It is a scalping knife." "Do you mean to say," asked the great-great-grandmother Letitia, "that you don't know enough to use that knife, great boy that you are?" The boy straightened himself. He saw the other Letitia and his blue eyes were full of admiration and bravery. "Of course I know how," said he. "Haven't I killed ten wolves and aren't their heads nailed to the outside of the meeting-house?" Letitia was quite sure that the boy lied, but she knew that he lied to please her, and she liked him for it. Great-great-grandmother Letitia sniffed. "You are the greatest braggart in the Precinct," said she. "Nary a wolf have you killed, and you ran because you heard a wild cat or a bear.
Thought: This text depicts dialogue between a boy and Letitia, and this dialogue is actually happening externally as a part of the story.
Output: Realism

Example 4:
Text: Joe, you stay near me and buy when I tell you.” The secretary of the board appeared on his little platform. “E. W. Clark & Company,” he announced, at one-thirty, “have just closed their doors.” “Tighe & Company,” he called at one-forty-five, “announce that they are compelled to suspend.” “The First National Bank of Philadelphia,” he called, at two o’clock, “begs to state that it cannot at present meet its obligations.” After each announcement, always, as in the past, when the gong had compelled silence, the crowd broke into an ominous “Aw, aw, aw.” “Tighe & Company,” thought Cowperwood, for a single second, when he heard it. “There’s an end of him.” And then he returned to his task. When the time for closing came, his coat torn, his collar twisted loose, his necktie ripped, his hat lost, he emerged sane, quiet, steady-mannered. “Well, Ed,” he inquired, meeting his brother, “how’d you make out?” The latter was equally torn, scratched, exhausted. “Christ,” he replied, tugging at his sleeves, “I never saw such a place as this. They almost tore my clothes off.”
Thought: This text depicts a series of actually occurring actions and dialogue, such as the secretary making announcements in the beginning, and a dialogue between two characters in the end.
Output: Realism

Example 5:
Text: While the Civil War went on she was still a very young girl; but she passed months of this long period in a state of almost passionate excitement, in which she felt herself at times (to her extreme confusion) stirred almost indiscriminately by the valour of either army. Of course the circumspection of suspicious swains had never gone the length of making her a social proscript; for the number of those whose hearts, as they approached her, beat only just fast enough to remind them they had heads as well, had kept her unacquainted with the supreme disciplines of her sex and age. She had had everything a girl could have: kindness, admiration, bonbons, bouquets, the sense of exclusion from none of the privileges of the world she lived in, abundant opportunity  for dancing, plenty of new dresses, the London Spectator, the latest publications, the music of Gounod, the poetry of Browning, the prose of George Eliot. These things now, as memory played over them, resolved themselves into a multitude of scenes and figures. Forgotten things came back to her; many others, which she had lately thought of great moment, dropped out of sight. The result was kaleidoscopic, but the movement of the instrument was checked at last by the servant's coming in with the name of a gentleman.
Thought: This text describes the internal feelings (e.g. "passionate excitement") and memories (e.g. "the music of Gounod") of a female character. 
Output: SOC

Example 6:
Text: Still harping on his show! Wait. I'd like to tell him before he goes all about this afternoon. The little drawing-room in a half-light filtered through the yellow curtains; Leah in a kind mood; she wore that white satin peignoir, falling in wide silky folds round her slender body; behind the big white collar her throat, a pink triangle; smiling she came towards me; her pale face set in fair tendrils of her hair, gold rippling upon her shoulders; all daintiness she is, my darling girl, and so young, nineteen, twenty, perhaps; she owns to eighteen; ah, she's an exquisite creature. Past the calm frontage of the Palais-Royal, past the Palais-Royal we go. She held out her hand to me; I kissed her forehead; very chastely; she leant against my shoulder and for an instant we stayed like that, without moving, and across the satin my hands clasped the soft warmth of her. Oh how I love her, my lovedear! And to think that all these people passing by have no idea of such happiness as mine, that it means nothing to all these people hurrying beside me, indifferent, the crowd!
Thought: This text is SOC in that it follows the narrator's mental traversal of Leah's appearance in a rhythmic manner, and concludes with expressions of the narrator's internal thoughts and feelings (e.g. "Oh how I love her"). 
Output: SOC

Example 7:
Text: When she had prepared for Mr. Hancock's first after noon patient Miriam sat down at her crowded table in a heavy drowse. No sound came from the house or from the den. The strip of sky above the blank wall opposite her window was an even cold grey. There was nothing to mark the movement of the noisy wind. The room was cold and stuffy. Shivering as she moved, she glanced round at the lamp. It was well trimmed. The yellow flame was at its broadest. The radiator glared. The warmth did not reach her. She was cold to the waist, her feet without feeling on the strip of linoleum; her knees protruding into the window space felt as if they were in cold water. Her arms crept and flushed with cold at every movement, strips of cold wrist disgusted her, showing beyond her skimpy sleeves and leading to the hopelessness of her purplish red hands swollen and clammy with cold. Her hot head and flushed cheeks begged for fresh air. Warm rooms, with carpets and fires; an even, airy warmth. . . . There were people who could be in this sort of cold and be active, with cool faces and warm hands, even just after lunch. If Mr. Leyton were here he would be briskly entering up the books -perhaps with a red nose; but very brisk.
Thought: This text describes a character's feelings of cold and her desires for fresh air and warmth, especially in the latter half of the passage. The use of ellipses especially suggests internal thinking. 
Output: SOC

Example 8:
Text: I was sure that Mrs. Blackett must be waiting impatiently to slice the potatoes into the chowder, layer after layer, with the fish. “You let me take holt o’ that basket, ma’am,” said the pleasant, anxious voice behind me. I turned, startled in the silence of the wide field, and saw an elderly man, bent in the shoulders as fishermen often are, gray-headed and clean-shaven, and with a timid air. It was William. He looked just like his mother, and I had been imagining that he was large and stout like his sister, Almira Todd; and, strange to say, my fancy had led me to picture him not far from thirty and a little loutish. It was necessary instead to pay William the respect due to age. I accustomed myself to plain facts on the instant, and we said good-morning like old friends. The basket was really heavy, and I put the hoe through its handle and offered him one end; then we moved easily toward the house together, speaking of the fine weather and of mackerel which were reported to be striking in all about the bay. William had been out since three o’clock, and had taken an extra fare of fish. I could feel that Mrs. Todd’s eyes were upon us as we approached the house, and although I fell behind in the narrow path, and let William take the basket alone and precede me at some little distance the rest of the way, I could plainly hear her greet him. “Got round to comin’ in, didn’t you?” she inquired, with amusement.
Thought: This text depicts snippets of dialogue and a series of actions (e.g. "said good-morning", "put the hoe") occurring in a narrative. 
Output: Realism

Example 9:
Text: A bloated carcass of a dog lay lolled on bladderwrack. Before him the gunwale of a boat, sunk in sand. Un coche ensable Louis Veuillot called Gautier's prose. These heavy sands are language tide and wind have silted here. And these, the stoneheaps of dead builders, a warren of weasel rats. Hide gold there. Try it. You have some. Sands and stones. Heavy of the past. Sir Lout's toys. Mind you don't get one bang on the ear. I'm the bloody well gigant rolls all them bloody well boulders, bones for my steppingstones. Feefawfum. I zmellz de bloodz odz an Iridzman. A point, live dog, grew into sight running across the sweep of sand. Lord, is he going to attack me? Respect his liberty. You will not be master of others or their slave. I have my stick. Sit tight. From farther away, walking shoreward across from the crested tide, figures, two. The two maries. They have tucked it safe mong the bulrushes. Peekaboo. I see you. No, the dog. He is running back to them. Who?
Thought: This text includes a series of short sentences including utterances (e.g. "You have some") and objects (e.g. "Sands and stones") that convey a quick succession of thoughts. 
Output: SOC

Example 10:
Text: He had given three years of his life for a mere pittance of pay, and now!-- Morning dawned at last, slowly, with a pale yellow dome of light rising silently above the bluffs, which stand like some huge storm-devastated castle, just east of the city. Out to the left the great river swept on its massive yet silent way to the south. Bluejays called across the water from hillside to hillside through the clear, beautiful air, and hawks began to skim the tops of the hills. The older men were astir early, but Private Smith had fallen at last into a sleep, and they went out without waking him. He lay on his knapsack, his gaunt face turned toward the ceiling, his hands clasped on his breast, with a curious pathetic effect of weakness and appeal. An engine switching near woke him at last, and he slowly sat up and stared about. He looked out of the window and saw that the sun was lightening the hills across the river. He rose and brushed his hair as well as he could, folded his blankets up, and went out to find his companions. They stood gazing silently at the river and at the hills. "Looks natcher'l, don't it?" they said, as he came out. "That's what it does," he replied. "An' it looks good. D 'yeh see that peak?" He pointed at a beautiful symmetrical peak, rising like a slightly truncated cone, so high that it seemed the very highest of them all.
Thought: This text includes a description of scenary, followed by a description of a sleeping character, and then his actions and dialogue with others.
Output: Realism
